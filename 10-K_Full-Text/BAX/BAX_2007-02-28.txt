Company
    Overview

Baxter is a global diversified medical products and services
    company with expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and
    biotechnology that assists healthcare professionals and their
    patients with the treatment of complex medical conditions,
    including hemophilia, immune disorders, cancer, infectious
    diseases, kidney disease, trauma and other conditions. The
    company applies its expertise to make a meaningful difference in
    patients’ lives. Baxter’s products are used by
    hospitals, clinical and medical research laboratories, kidney
    dialysis centers, rehabilitation centers, nursing homes,
    doctors’ offices and by patients at home under physician
    supervision. Baxter manufactures products in 28 countries and
    sells them in over 100 countries.

Baxter International Inc. was incorporated under Delaware law in
    1931. As used in this report, except as otherwise indicated in
    information incorporated by reference, “Baxter
    International” means Baxter International Inc. and
    “Baxter”, the “company” or the
    “Company” means Baxter International and its
    consolidated subsidiaries.

Business
    Segments

The BioScience, Medication Delivery and Renal segments comprise
    Baxter’s continuing operations.

BioScience.

The BioScience business
    manufactures plasma-based and recombinant proteins used to treat
    hemophilia. Other products include plasma-based therapies to
    treat immune disorders, alpha

1-antitrypsin

deficiency and other chronic blood-related conditions;
    biosurgery products for hemostasis, wound-sealing, and tissue
    regeneration; and vaccines. The business also provides
    technologies used in adult stem-cell therapies. Throughout 2006
    the BioScience business also manufactured manual and automated
    blood and blood-component separation and collection systems
    through its Transfusion Therapies business (TT). On
    October 2, 2006, the company entered into a definitive
    agreement to sell substantially all of the assets and
    liabilities of TT to an affiliate of Texas Pacific Group (TPG)
    for $540 million. Subject to customary closing conditions,
    the sale is expected to close in the first quarter of
    2007. Under transition agreements, the company will provide
    manufacturing and a variety of support services to the business
    for a period of time after divestiture, which varies based on
    the product or service provided and other factors.

Medication Delivery.

The Medication Delivery
    business manufactures intravenous (IV) solutions
    and administration sets, pre-mixed drugs and drug reconstitution
    systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for injectable drugs and
    electronic infusion devices. The business also provides IV
    nutrition products, inhalation anesthetics for general
    anesthesia, contract manufacturing services, and drug
    formulation and packaging technologies.

Renal.

The Renal business manufactures
    products for peritoneal dialysis (PD), a home therapy for people
    with end-stage renal disease, or irreversible kidney failure.
    These products include PD solutions and related supplies to help
    patients safely perform solution exchanges, as well as automated
    PD cyclers that provide therapy to patients overnight. The
    business also distributes products for hemodialysis.

Financial information about Baxter’s segments and principal
    product lines is incorporated by reference from the section
    entitled “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — Note 11 Segment Information” of Baxter’s Annual Report to
    Shareholders for fiscal year 2006 which is filed as
    Exhibit 13 to this Report on

Form 10-K.

Sales and
    Distribution

The company has its own sales force and also makes sales to and
    through independent distributors, drug wholesalers acting as
    sales agents and specialty pharmacy or homecare companies. In
    the United States, Cardinal Health, Inc. (Cardinal Health)
    warehouses and ships a significant portion of the company’s
    products through its distribution centers. These centers are
    generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate


prompt customer service. Sales and distribution methods include
    frequent contact by sales representatives, automated
    communications via various electronic purchasing systems,
    circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins, direct-mail
    campaigns, trade publication presence and advertising.

International sales are made and products are distributed on a
    direct basis or through independent local distributors in more
    than 100 countries. International subsidiaries employ their own
    field sales forces in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
    Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, the Czech Republic,
    Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala,
    India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, The Netherlands, New
    Zealand, Norway, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Poland,
    Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan,
    Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Venezuela. In other
    countries, sales are made through independent distributors or
    sales agents.

Contractual
    Arrangements

A substantial portion of the company’s products are sold
    through contracts with customers, both within and outside the
    United States. Many of these contracts have terms of more than
    one year and place limits on price increases. In the case of
    hospitals, clinical laboratories and other facilities, these
    contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product
    or categories of products to be purchased by the customer. In
    keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in
    healthcare delivery, some hospitals and other customers of
    medical products have joined group purchasing organizations
    (GPOs), or combined to form integrated delivery networks (IDNs),
    to enhance purchasing power. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing
    arrangements with manufacturers and distributors, and the
    negotiated prices are made available to members. There has been
    consolidation in our customer base. As a result, transactions
    with customers are larger and more complex. The enhanced
    purchasing power of these customers increases the pressure on
    product pricing.

Baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major GPOs
    in the United States. Some of these GPOs have agreements with
    more than one supplier for certain products. Accordingly, in
    these cases, Baxter faces competition from other suppliers even
    where a customer is a member of a GPO under contract with
    Baxter. Baxter’s sales could be adversely affected if any
    of its contracts with its GPOs or IDNs are terminated in part or
    in their entirety, or members decide to purchase from another
    supplier.

Raw
    Materials

Raw materials essential to Baxter’s business are purchased
    worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous
    suppliers. Although most of these materials are generally
    available, certain raw materials used in producing some of the
    company’s products are available only from one or a limited
    number of suppliers, and Baxter has at times experienced
    occasional shortages of supply. In an effort to manage risk
    associated with raw materials supply, Baxter works closely with
    its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of
    supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. The
    company also seeks to develop new sources of supply where
    beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy.

In some situations, the company has long-term supply contracts
    with its suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and
    manage the risk of price increases. Baxter is not always able to
    recover cost increases for raw materials through customer
    pricing due to contractual limits and market pressure on such
    price increases.

Some of the raw materials employed in Baxter’s production
    processes are derived from human and animal origins. Though
    every care is taken in assuring the safety of these raw
    materials, the nature of their origin elevates the potential for
    the introduction of pathogenic agents. Baxter believes the
    production processes that employ these materials adequately
    eliminate or inactivate infectious or toxic elements that may be
    present in these raw materials.

As is common in new technologies including biotechnology, the
    precision and accuracy of raw material specifications is less
    mature than in other industries. This can have a potential
    impact on the ability to produce product at the quality
    standards Baxter adheres to and within Baxter’s cost
    expectations.


Competition

Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its
    businesses, Baxter faces competition in each of its segments
    from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical
    companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily focused on
    cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and
    technological innovation. There has been consolidation in the
    company’s customer base, and by its competitors, which has
    resulted in pricing and market share pressures.

Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to
    exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world
    utilize various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures,
    such as price controls, product formularies (lists of
    recommended or approved products), and competitive tenders which
    require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of
    Baxter’s products are dependent, in part, on the
    availability of reimbursement by government agencies and
    healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other
    private payers. Many state governments have adopted or proposed
    initiatives relating to Medicaid and other health programs that
    may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that Baxter and
    other providers are required to pay to the state. In addition to
    government regulation, managed care organizations (MCOs) in the
    United States, which include medical insurance companies,
    medical plan administrators, health-maintenance organizations,
    hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers,
    continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare
    products. MCOs seek to contain healthcare expenditures, and
    their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their
    consolidation into fewer, larger organizations and a growing
    number of enrolled patients. Baxter faces similar issues outside
    of the United States. In Europe and some other markets, for
    example, the government provides healthcare at low cost to
    patients, and controls its expenditures by regulating prices or
    limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products.

Baxter faces competition from global and regional companies both
    large and small in each of the markets in which it participates.
    BioScience continues to face competitors from pharmaceutical,
    biotechnology and other companies. Medication Delivery faces
    competition from medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical
    companies particularly in the multi-source generics and inhaled
    anesthetics markets. In Renal, global and regional competitors
    continue to expand their manufacturing capacity for PD products
    and their PD sales and marketing channels.

Baxter’s Medication Delivery, BioScience and Renal
    businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of
    competitive advantages. The Medication Delivery business
    benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering, as
    well as strong relationships with customers, including hospitals
    and acute care facilities, customer purchasing groups and
    pharmaceutical companies. The BioScience business benefits from
    a number of competitive advantages, such as continued innovation
    of products and services, consistency of its supply of products,
    and strong customer relationships. Baxter’s Renal business
    benefits from its position as one of the world’s leading
    manufacturer of PD products, as well as its strong relationships
    with customers and patients, including the many patients who
    self-administer the home-based therapy supplied by Baxter.
    Baxter also benefits from cost advantages as a result of shared
    manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its
    products.

Intellectual
    Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to
    Baxter’s business. Baxter also relies on trademarks,
    copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and confidentiality
    agreements to develop, maintain and strengthen its competitive
    position. Baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks
    throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements
    relating to various third-party patents and technologies.
    Products manufactured by Baxter are sold primarily under its own
    trademarks and trade names. Some products distributed by the
    company are sold under the company’s trade names while
    others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers. Trade
    secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary
    information is also important to Baxter. The company maintains
    certain details about its processes, products, and technology as
    trade secrets and generally requires employees, consultants,
    parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners
    to enter into confidentiality agreements.


Baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology
    through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis. This
    protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such
    protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company.
    Baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of
    its patents and trademarks. Baxter will continue to take
    commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and
    trademarks around the world against potential infringers.

Baxter cannot assure that pending patent applications will
    result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will
    not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that Baxter
    patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual
    property rights of others will not prevent the company from
    selling certain products or including key features in the
    company’s products.

Baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent
    litigation. At any given time, the company generally is involved
    as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent
    infringement and other intellectual-property related actions.
    Such litigation can result in significant royalty or other
    payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of
    products.

Research
    and Development

Baxter’s investment in research and development is
    essential to its future growth. Accordingly, Baxter is
    increasingly engaged in research and development programs to
    develop innovative products, systems and manufacturing methods.
    Expenditures for Baxter’s research and development
    activities relating to continuing operations were
    $614 million in 2006, $533 million in 2005 and
    $517 million in 2004. These activities are performed at
    research and development centers located around the world
    including facilities in Austria, Belgium, France, Japan and the
    United States.

Principal areas of strategic focus for research and development
    include recombinant therapeutics, adult stem-cell therapy,
    plasma-based therapeutics, biosurgery products, small molecule
    drugs, enhanced packaging systems for medication delivery,
    kidney dialysis, drug formulation technologies and sterilization
    technologies. The company’s research efforts emphasize
    self-manufactured product development, and portions of that
    research relate to multiple product lines. Baxter supplements
    its own research and development efforts by acquiring various
    technologies and entering into development agreements with third
    parties. For example, Baxter is involved in partnerships with
    both Nektar Therapeutics and Lipoxen Technologies to leverage
    each company’s expertise in developing new therapies to
    reduce the frequency of injections required to treat
    blood-clotting disorders.

Baxter’s competitors will continue to introduce competitive
    products. The company’s research and development efforts
    are essential to remaining competitive in all three of its
    business segments. The development and acquisition of innovative
    products and technologies that improve efficacy, safety,
    patients’ ease of use and cost-effectiveness are important
    to Baxter’s success. The success of new product offerings
    will depend on many factors, including the company’s
    ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs,
    obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, develop and
    manufacture products in an economical and timely manner, and
    differentiate its products from those of its competitors.

Quality
    Management

Baxter places significant emphasis on providing quality products
    and services to its customers. Quality management plays an
    essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements,
    preventing defects and improving the company’s products and
    services. Baxter has a network of quality systems throughout the
    company’s business units and facilities which relate to the
    design, development, manufacturing, packaging, sterilization,
    handling, distribution and labeling of the company’s
    products. To assess and facilitate compliance with applicable
    requirements, the company regularly reviews its quality systems
    to determine their effectiveness and identify areas for
    improvement. Baxter also performs assessments of its suppliers
    of raw materials, components and finished goods. In addition,
    the company conducts quality management reviews designed to
    inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of
    products and services.


From time to time, the company may determine that products
    manufactured or marketed by the company do not meet company
    specifications, published standards, such as those issued by the
    International Standards Organization, or regulatory
    requirements. When a quality issue is identified, Baxter will
    investigate and take appropriate corrective action, such as
    withdrawal of the product from the market, correction of the
    product at the customer location, notice to the customer of
    revised labeling,

and/or

other
    actions. Please refer to our discussion of the COLLEAGUE
    infusion pump under the caption entitled “COLLEAGUE
    Matter” in “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis” of Baxter’s
    Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2006.

Government
    Regulation

The operations of Baxter and many of the products manufactured
    or sold by the company are subject to extensive regulation by
    numerous governmental agencies, both within and outside the
    United States. In the United States, the federal agencies that
    regulate the company’s facilities, operations, employees,
    products (their manufacture, sale, import and export) and
    services include: the United States Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA), the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Environmental Protection
    Agency, the Occupational Health & Safety
    Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of
    Labor, the Department of Defense, Customs and Border Protection,
    the Department of Commerce, the Department of Treasury and
    others. Because Baxter supplies products and services to
    healthcare providers that are reimbursed by federally funded
    programs such as Medicare, its activities are also subject to
    regulation by the Center for Medicare/Medicaid Services and
    enforcement by the Office of the Inspector General within the
    Department of Health and Human Services. State agencies also
    regulate the facilities, operations, employees, products and
    services of the company within their respective states.
    Government agencies outside the United States also regulate
    public health, product registration, manufacturing,
    environmental conditions, labor, exports, imports and other
    aspects of the company’s global operations.

The FDA in the United States, as well as other governmental
    agencies inside and outside of the United States, administer
    requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness,
    manufacturing, labeling, promotion and advertising, distribution
    and post-market surveillance of Baxter’s products. The
    company must obtain specific approval from the FDA and

non-U.S. regulatory

authorities before it can market and sell most of its products
    in a particular country. Even after the company obtains
    regulatory approval to market a product, the product and the
    company’s manufacturing processes are subject to continued
    review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.

The company is subject to possible administrative and legal
    actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies for violations
of laws and regulations including, without limitation, those laws and
regulations described above. Such actions
    may include product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to
    halt manufacture and distribution, and other civil and criminal
    sanctions. From time to time, the company has instituted
    compliance actions, such as removing products from the market
    that were found not to meet applicable requirements and
    improving the effectiveness of quality systems. Please refer to
    our discussion of the COLLEAGUE infusion pump under the caption
    entitled “COLLEAGUE Matter” in “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis” of
    Baxter’s Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2006.

Environmental policies of the company require compliance with
    all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate, among
    other things, appropriate capital expenditures for environmental
    protection. Baxter made various non-material capital
    expenditures for environmental protection during 2006 and
    similar expenditures are planned for 2007.

International
    Markets

Baxter generates more than 50% of its revenues outside the
    United States. While healthcare cost containment continues to be
    a focus around the world, demand for healthcare products and
    services continues to be strong worldwide, particularly in
    developing markets. The company’s strategies emphasize
    global expansion and technological innovation to advance medical
    care worldwide. International operations are subject to certain
    additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the
    United States, such as changes in currency exchange rates, price
    and currency exchange controls, import restrictions,
    nationalization,


expropriation and other governmental action, violations of
    U.S. or local laws as well as volatile economic, social and
    political conditions in certain countries.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider
    the following risk factors. If any of the events described below
    occurs, our business, financial condition and results of
    operations and future growth prospects could suffer.

If we
    are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to
    keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be adversely
    affected.

The successful and timely implementation of our business model
    depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and
    introduce new products. The success of new product offerings
    will depend on many factors, including our ability to properly
    anticipate and satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatory
    approvals on a timely basis, develop and manufacture products in
    an economic and timely manner, maintain advantageous positions
    with respect to intellectual property, and differentiate our
    products from those of our competitors. A failure by us to
    introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce
    these products on schedule could have an adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

The development and acquisition of innovative products and
    technologies that improve efficacy, safety, patients’ ease
    of use and cost-effectiveness are important to Baxter’s
    success. If we cannot adapt to changing technologies, our
    products may become obsolete, and our business could suffer.
    Because the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid
    technological change, we may be unable to anticipate changes in
    our current and potential customers’ requirements. Our
    success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to
    enhance our existing products, develop new technology that
    addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our
    prospective customers, license or acquire leading technologies
    and respond to technological advances and emerging industry
    standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis.
    The development of our proprietary technology entails
    significant technical and business risks.

If we
    are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities in which to
    invest or if we are unsuccessful in exiting low margin
    businesses or products our business, financial condition and
    results could be adversely affected.

Successful execution of our business strategy depends in part on
    improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our current
    and future products. A failure to identify and take advantage of
    opportunities which allow us to increase our profit margins or a
    failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses or terminate
    low profit margin products may result in us failing to meet our
    financial targets and may otherwise have an adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are
    subject to a number of existing laws and regulations,
    non-compliance with certain of which could adversely affect our
    business, financial condition and results of operations, and we
    are susceptible to a changing regulatory
    environment.

As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and
    products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous
    governmental agencies, both within and outside the United
    States. The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are
    ourselves subject to these laws and regulations, and is also
    indirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may
    not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and
    regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our
    customers in a manner that complies with those laws and
    regulations.


The manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products are
    subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA. Any new
    product must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and
    other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated
    by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. We may elect to
    delay or cancel our anticipated regulatory submissions for new
    indications for our current or proposed new products for a
    number of reasons. Failure to comply with the requirements of
    the FDA could result in warning letters, product recalls or
    seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture
    and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions,
    refusal of the government to grant approvals, restrictions on
    operations or withdrawal of existing approvals. Any of these
    actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our
    products which could adversely affect our sales.

We continue to address issues with our infusion pumps as
    discussed further under the caption entitled “COLLEAGUE
    Matter” in “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis”  of Baxter’s Annual
    Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2006. There can be no
    assurance that we will resolve these pump issues without
    incurring additional charges or facing any of the sanctions
    available to the FDA under the Consent Decree entered into with
    the United States concerning our infusion pumps. Third parties may file
    claims against us in connection these pump issues. In addition,
    our sales of other products may be adversely affected if we
    experience a loss of customer confidence as a result of these
    pump issues.

In addition, the healthcare regulatory environment may change in
    a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth. The
    healthcare industry is likely to continue to undergo significant
    changes for the foreseeable future, which could have an adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. We cannot predict the effect of possible future
    legislation and regulation.

If
    reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or
    modified, our business would suffer.

Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which
    the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance,
    managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar health care
    management organizations, or reimbursed by government health
    administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and
    other third-party payors. These health care management
    organizations and third-party payors are increasingly
    challenging the prices charged for medical products and
    services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has
    become a priority of federal and state governments, and the
    prices of drugs have been targeted in this effort. We also face
    challenges in certain foreign markets where the pricing and
    profitability of our products generally are subject to
    government controls. Accordingly, our current and potential
    products may not be considered cost effective, and reimbursement
    to the consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us
    to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and
    regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change
    at any time, including in ways that are adverse to us. Any
    reduction in Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payor
    reimbursements could have a negative effect on our operating
    results.

Failure
    to provide quality products and services to our customers could
    have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to
    regulatory actions and costly litigation.

Our future operating results will depend on our ability to
    implement and improve our quality management program, and
    effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to
    quality management. We place significant emphasis on providing
    quality products and services to our customers. Quality
    management plays an essential role in determining and meeting
    customer requirements, preventing defects and improving the
    company’s products and services. While Baxter has a network
    of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities,
    which relate to the design, development, manufacturing,
    packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution and labeling of
    our products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect
    to any of our products. A quality or safety issue could have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations and may result in any of the actions described in
the first paragraph above. In addition, we may be named
    as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which could result
    in costly litigation, reduced sales, significant liabilities and
    diversion of our management’s time, attention and
    resources. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse
    publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees.


Consolidation
    in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

There has been consolidation in our customer base, and by our
    competitors, which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures.
    As these consolidations occur, competition to provide products
    like ours will become more intense, and the importance of
    establishing relationships with key industry participants will
    become greater. Customers will continue to work and organize to
    negotiate price reductions for our products and services. To the
    extent we are forced to reduce our prices, our business will
    become less profitable unless we were able to achieve
    corresponding reductions in our expenses.

If we
    are unable to protect our patents and other proprietary rights
    or infringe upon the patents or other proprietary rights of
    others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be
    materially damaged.

Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our
    business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our
    ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent
    rights, both in the U.S. and in other countries. The patent
    position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves
    complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation
    concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry.
    Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of
    our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that
    our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third
    parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a
    loss of patent protection or the ability to market products,
    which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise
    materially affect future results of operations.

We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and
    know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive
    positions. While we protect our proprietary rights to the extent
    possible, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know,
    discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary
    information or techniques, that they will not gain access to our
    trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.
    Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect
    unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets.
    Misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an
    adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to
    incur substantial litigation costs.

We
    have many competitors, several of which have significantly
    greater financial and other resources.

Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its
    businesses, Baxter faces substantial competition in each of its
    segments, from international and domestic healthcare and
    pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily
    focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product
    performance, and technological innovation. Some competitors,
    principally large pharmaceutical companies, have greater
    financial, research and development and marketing resources than
    Baxter. Competition may increase further as additional companies
    begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to
    compete directly with ours. Greater financial, research and
    development and marketing resources may allow our competitors to
    respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes
    in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete
    or non-competitive.

If our
    competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or
    achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization
    than we do, our operations will likely be negatively
    affected.

We also face competition for marketing, distribution and
    collaborative development agreements, for establishing
    relationships with academic and research institutions, and for
    licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic
    institutions, government agencies and other public and private
    research organizations also may conduct research, seek patent
    protection and establish collaborative arrangements for
    discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of
    products similar to ours. These companies and institutions
    compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific
    and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies
    complementary to our programs.


We are
    subject to risks associated with doing business
    globally.

Our operations, both within and outside the United States, are
    subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and
    under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions
    and geographies. These risks include possible nationalization,
    expropriation, importation limitations, violations of
    U.S. or local laws, pricing restrictions, and other
    restrictive governmental actions or economic destabilization,
    instability, disruption or destruction in a significant
    geographic region — due to the location of
    manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or
    customers — regardless of cause, including war,
    terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, and
    natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire,
    earthquake, storm or disease. Also, fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates can impact our consolidated financial
    results.

    Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by Baxter in
    the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis
    and that such information is communicated to management,
    including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer
    and its Board of Directors to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
    2006.

    auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
