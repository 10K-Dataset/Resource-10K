TABLE OF
    CONTENTS


PART I

Item 1.

Business.

Company
    Overview

Baxter develops, manufactures and markets products that save and
    sustain the lives of people with hemophilia, immune disorders,
    infectious diseases, kidney disease, trauma and other chronic
    and acute medical conditions. As a global, diversified
    healthcare company, Baxter applies a unique combination of
    expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology
    to create products that advance patient care worldwide. These
    products are used by hospitals, kidney dialysis centers, nursing
    homes, rehabilitation centers, doctors’ offices, clinical
    and medical research laboratories, and by patients at home under
    physician supervision. Baxter manufactures products in 26
    countries and sells them in more than 100 countries.

Baxter International Inc. was incorporated under Delaware law in
    1931. As used in this report, except as otherwise indicated in
    information incorporated by reference, “Baxter
    International” means Baxter International Inc. and
    “Baxter,” the “company” or the
    “Company” means Baxter International and its
    consolidated subsidiaries.

Business
    Segments

The BioScience, Medication Delivery and Renal segments comprise
    Baxter’s continuing operations.

BioScience.

The BioScience business
    manufactures recombinant and plasma-based proteins to treat
    hemophilia and other bleeding disorders; plasma-based therapies
    to treat immune deficiencies, alpha

1-antitrypsin

deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute
    blood-related conditions; products for regenerative medicine,
    such as biosurgery products and technologies used in adult
    stem-cell therapies; and vaccines.

Medication Delivery.

The Medication Delivery
    business manufactures intravenous (IV) solutions and
    administration sets, premixed drugs and drug-reconstitution
    systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for injectable drugs, IV
    nutrition products, infusion pumps, and inhalation anesthetics,
    as well as products and services related to pharmacy
    compounding, drug formulation and packaging technologies.

Renal.

The Renal business provides products to
    treat end-stage renal disease, or irreversible kidney failure.
    The business manufactures solutions and other products for
    peritoneal dialysis (PD), a home-based therapy, and also
    distributes products for hemodialysis (HD), which is generally
    conducted in a hospital or clinic.

Financial information about Baxter’s segments and principal
    product lines is incorporated by reference from the section
    entitled “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — Note 12 Segment Information” of
    Baxter’s Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2008
    (the “Annual Report”), which is filed as
    Exhibit 13 to this Report on

Form 10-K.

Sales and
    Distribution

The company has its own sales force and also makes sales to and
    through independent distributors, drug wholesalers acting as
    sales agents and specialty pharmacy or homecare companies. In
    the United States, Cardinal Health, Inc. warehouses and ships a
    significant portion of the company’s products through its
    distribution centers. These centers are generally stocked with
    adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service.
    Sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales
    representatives, automated communications via various electronic
    purchasing systems, circulation of catalogs and merchandising
    bulletins, direct-mail campaigns, trade publication presence and
    advertising.

International sales are made and products are distributed on a
    direct basis or through independent local distributors or sales
    agents in more than 100 countries.

International
    Markets

Baxter generates approximately 60% of its revenues outside the
    United States. While healthcare cost containment continues to be
    a focus around the world, demand for healthcare products and
    services continues



to be strong worldwide. The company’s strategies emphasize
    global expansion and technological innovation to advance medical
    care worldwide. Baxter’s operations are subject to certain
    additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the
    United States, such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates,
    changes in exchange controls, loss of business in government
    tenders, nationalization, increasingly complex labor
    environments, expropriation and other governmental actions,
    changes in taxation, importation limitations, export control
    restrictions, violations of U.S. or local laws, dependence
    on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions,
    economic destabilization, instability, disruption or destruction
    in a significant geographic region — due to the
    location of manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or
    customers.

Financial information about foreign and domestic operations and
    geographic information is incorporated by reference from the
    section entitled “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — Note 12 Segment Information” of
    the Annual Report.

Contractual
    Arrangements

Substantial portions of the company’s products are sold
    through contracts with customers, both within and outside the
    United States. Some of these contracts have terms of more than
    one year and place limits on our ability to increase prices. In
    the case of hospitals and other facilities, these contracts may
    specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories
    of products to be purchased by the customer.

In keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in
    healthcare delivery, many hospitals and other customers of
    medical products in the United States and in other countries
    have joined group purchasing organizations (GPOs), or combined
    to form integrated delivery networks (IDNs), to enhance
    purchasing power. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements
    with manufacturers and distributors, and the negotiated prices
    are made available to members. Baxter has purchasing agreements
    with several of the major GPOs in the United States. GPOs may
    have agreements with more than one supplier for certain
    products. Accordingly, in these cases, Baxter faces competition
    from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a GPO
    under contract with Baxter.

Raw
    Materials

Raw materials essential to Baxter’s business are purchased
    from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of
    business. Although most of these materials are generally
    available, certain raw materials used in producing some of the
    company’s products are available only from one or a limited
    number of suppliers, and Baxter at times may experience
    shortages of supply. In an effort to manage risk associated with
    raw materials supply, Baxter works closely with its suppliers to
    help ensure availability and continuity of supply while
    maintaining high quality and reliability. The company also seeks
    to develop new and alternative sources of supply where
    beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy.

The company also utilizes long-term supply contracts with some
    suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the
    risk of price increases. Baxter is not always able to recover
    cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to
    contractual limits and market pressure on such price increases.

Competition

Baxter’s Medication Delivery, BioScience and Renal
    businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of
    competitive advantages. The Medication Delivery business
    benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering, as
    well as strong relationships with customers, including
    hospitals, customer purchasing groups and pharmaceutical and
    biotechnology companies. The BioScience business benefits from
    continued innovation in its products and therapies, consistency
    of its supply of products, and strong customer relationships.
    The Renal business benefits from its position as one of the
    world’s leading manufacturers of PD products, as well as
    its strong relationships with customers and patients, including
    the many patients who self-administer the home-based therapy
    supplied by Baxter. Baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies
    and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing
    facilities and the technological advantages of its products.



Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its
    businesses, Baxter faces competition in each of its segments
    from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical
    companies of all sizes. BioScience continues to face competitors
    from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies.
    Medication Delivery faces competition from medical device
    manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies particularly in the
    multi-source generics and anesthetics markets. In Renal, global
    and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing
    capacity for PD products and their PD sales and marketing
    channels. Competition is primarily focused on
    cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and
    technological innovation. There has been consolidation in the
    company’s customer base and by its competitors, which
    continues to result in pricing and market share pressures.

Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to
    exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world
    use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, such
    as price controls, product formularies (lists of recommended or
    approved products), and competitive tenders which require the
    submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of Baxter’s
    products are dependent, in part, on the availability of
    reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as
    well as insurance companies and other private payers. In the
    United States, many state governments have adopted or proposed
    initiatives relating to Medicaid and other health programs that
    may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that Baxter and
    other providers are required to pay to the state. In addition to
    government regulation, managed care organizations in the United
    States, which include medical insurance companies, medical plan
    administrators, health-maintenance organizations, hospital and
    physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers, continue to
    put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products.
    Managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare
    expenditures, and their purchasing strength has been increasing
    due to their consolidation into fewer, larger organizations and
    a growing number of enrolled patients. Baxter faces similar
    issues outside of the United States. In Europe and Latin
    America, for example, the government provides healthcare at low
    cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing
    products through public tenders, regulating prices, setting
    reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or
    patient access to certain products.

Intellectual
    Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to
    Baxter’s business. Baxter relies on trademarks, copyrights,
    trade secrets, know-how and confidentiality agreements to
    develop, maintain and strengthen its competitive position.
    Baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the
    world and has entered into license arrangements relating to
    various third-party patents and technologies. Products
    manufactured by Baxter are sold primarily under its own
    trademarks and trade names. Some products distributed by the
    company are sold under the company’s trade names while
    others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers. Trade
    secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary
    information is also important to Baxter. The company maintains
    certain details about its processes, products, and technology as
    trade secrets and generally requires employees, consultants,
    parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners
    to enter into confidentiality agreements.

Baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology
    through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis. This
    protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such
    protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company.
    Baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of
    its patents and trademarks. Baxter will continue to take
    commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and
    trademarks around the world against potential infringers,
    including judicial or administrative action where appropriate.

Baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent
    litigation. At any given time, the company is involved as either
    a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and
    other intellectual property-related actions. Such litigation can
    result in significant royalty or other payments or result in
    injunctions that can prevent the sale of products.

Research
    and Development

Baxter’s investment in research and development is
    essential to its future growth and its ability to remain
    competitive in all three of its business segments. Accordingly,
    Baxter continues to increase its investment in



research and development programs to develop innovative
    products, systems and manufacturing methods. Expenditures for
    Baxter’s research and development activities were
    $868 million in 2008, $760 million in 2007 and
    $614 million in 2006. These expenditures include costs
    associated with research and development activities performed at
    the company’s research and development centers located
    around the world, which include facilities in Austria, Belgium,
    Japan and the United States, as well as in-licensing, milestone
    and reimbursement payments made to partners for research and
    development work performed at non-Baxter locations.

Principal areas of strategic focus for research and development
    include recombinant therapeutics, plasma-based therapeutics,
    vaccines, initiatives in regenerative medicine including adult
    stem-cell therapy, kidney dialysis, small molecule drugs,
    enhanced packaging systems for medication delivery, drug
    formulation technologies, and pharmacy compounding. The
    company’s research efforts emphasize self-manufactured
    product development, and portions of that research relate to
    multiple product lines. Baxter supplements its own research and
    development efforts by acquiring various technologies and
    entering into development and other collaboration agreements
    with third parties. For more information on the company’s
    research and development activities, please refer to our
    discussion under the caption entitled “Research and
    Development” in “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis” of the Annual Report.

Quality
    Management

Baxter places significant emphasis on providing quality products
    and services to its customers. Quality management plays an
    essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements,
    preventing defects and improving the company’s products and
    services. Baxter has a network of quality systems throughout the
    company’s business units and facilities that relate to the
    design, development, manufacturing, packaging, sterilization,
    handling, distribution and labeling of the company’s
    products. To assess and facilitate compliance with applicable
    requirements, the company regularly reviews its quality systems
    to determine their effectiveness and identify areas for
    improvement. Baxter also performs assessments of its suppliers
    of raw materials, components and finished goods. In addition,
    the company conducts quality management reviews designed to
    inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of
    products and services.

From time to time, the company may determine that products
    manufactured or marketed by the company do not meet company
    specifications, published standards, such as those issued by the
    International Standards Organization, or regulatory
    requirements. When a quality issue is identified, Baxter
    investigates the issue and takes appropriate corrective action,
    such as withdrawal of the product from the market, correction of
    the product at the customer location, notice to the customer of
    revised labeling, and other actions. For more information on
    corrective actions taken by Baxter, please refer to our
    discussion under the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory
    Matters” in “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis” of the Annual Report.

Government
    Regulation

The operations of Baxter and many of the products manufactured
    or sold by the company are subject to extensive regulation by
    numerous government agencies, both within and outside the United
    States. In the United States, the federal agencies that regulate
    the company’s facilities, operations, employees, products
    (their manufacture, sale, import and export) and services
    include: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the
    Drug Enforcement Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency,
    the Occupational Health & Safety Administration, the
    Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the
    Department of Defense, Customs and Border Protection, the
    Department of Commerce, the Department of Treasury and others.
    Because Baxter supplies products and services to healthcare
    providers that are reimbursed by federally funded programs such
    as Medicare, its activities are also subject to regulation by
    the Center for Medicare/Medicaid Services and enforcement by the
    Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health
    and Human Services. State agencies in the United
    States also regulate the facilities, operations, employees,
    products and services of the company within their respective
    states. Outside the United States, our products and operations
    are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies,
    including the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) in the European
    Union. International government agencies also regulate public
    health, product registration, manufacturing, environmental
    conditions, labor, exports, imports and other aspects of the
    company’s global operations.



The FDA in the United States, the EMEA in Europe, and other
    government agencies inside and outside of the United States,
    administer requirements covering the testing, safety,
    effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and
    advertising, distribution and post-market surveillance of
    Baxter’s products. The company must obtain specific
    approval from the FDA and

non-U.S. regulatory

authorities before it can market and sell most of its products
    in a particular country. Even after the company obtains
    regulatory approval to market a product, the product and the
    company’s manufacturing processes are subject to continued
    review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.

The company is subject to possible administrative and legal
    actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies inside and
    outside the United States. Such actions may include warning
    letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions,
    injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products,
    civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant
    approvals, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing
    approvals. From time to time, the company institutes compliance
    actions, such as removing products from the market found not to
    meet applicable requirements and improving the effectiveness of
    quality systems. For more information on compliance actions
    taken by the company, please refer to our discussion under the
    caption entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” of the
    Annual Report.

Environmental policies of the company require compliance with
    all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate, among
    other things, appropriate capital expenditures for environmental
    protection.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, Baxter employed approximately

    patents of third parties preventing or restricting the
    company’s manufacture, sale or use of affected products or
    technology; the impact of geographic and product mix on the
    company’s sales; the impact of competitive products and

    and pricing of acceptable raw materials and component supply;
    global regulatory, trade and tax policies; any changes in law
    concerning the taxation of income, including income earned
    outside of the United States; actions by tax authorities in
    connection with ongoing tax audits; the company’s ability
    to realize the anticipated benefits of restructuring
    initiatives; change in credit agency ratings; any impact of the
    commercial and credit environment on the company and its
    customers; continued developments in the market for transfusion

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider
    the following risk factors. If any of the events described below
    occurs, our business, financial condition and results of
    operations and future growth prospects could suffer.

If we
    are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to
    keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be adversely
    affected.

The successful and timely implementation of our business model
    depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and
    introduce new products. As Baxter’s competitors will
    continue to introduce competitive products, the development and
    acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve
    efficacy, safety, patients’ and clinicians’ ease of
    use and cost-effectiveness are important to Baxter’s
    success. The success of new product offerings will depend on
    many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and
    satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely
    basis, develop and manufacture products in an economic and
    timely manner, maintain advantageous positions with respect to
    intellectual property, and differentiate our products from those
    of our competitors. A failure by us to introduce planned
    products or other new products or to introduce these products on
    schedule could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

The development and acquisition of innovative products and
    technologies that improve efficacy, safety, patients’ and
    clinicians’ ease of use and cost-effectiveness involve
    significant technical and business risks. If we cannot adapt to
    changing technologies, our products may become obsolete, and our
    business could suffer. Because the healthcare industry is
    characterized by rapid technological change, we may be unable to
    anticipate changes in our current and potential customers’
    requirements. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability
    to continue to enhance our existing products, develop new
    technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and
    varied needs of our prospective customers, license or acquire
    leading technologies and respond to technological advances and
    emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and
    cost-effective basis.



We are
    subject to a number of existing laws and regulations,
    non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations, and we are
    susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.

As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and
    products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous
    government agencies, both within and outside the United States.
    The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are subject
    to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number
    of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by
    specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be
    capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies
    with those laws and regulations.

The manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products are
    subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA and other
    regulatory authorities both within and outside the United
    States. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous
    testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming
    procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory
    authorities. We may elect to delay or cancel our anticipated
    regulatory submissions for new indications for our current or
    proposed new products for a number of reasons. Failure to comply
    with the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities
    could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures,
    monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and
    distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal
    of a government to grant approvals, restrictions on operations
    or withdrawal of existing approvals. Any of these actions could
    cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products,
    which could adversely affect our sales.

We continue to address issues with our infusion pumps as
    discussed further under the caption entitled “Certain
    Regulatory Matters” in “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis” of the Annual Report. In connection with
    these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or
    civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that
    additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will
    not occur, that substantial additional charges or significant
    asset impairments may not be required, or that additional
    legislation or regulation will not be introduced that may
    adversely affect the company’s operations. Third parties
    may also file claims against us in connection with these pump
    issues. In addition, sales of these products may continue to be
    affected and sales of other Baxter products may be adversely
    affected if we do not adequately address these pump issues.

In addition, the healthcare regulatory environment may change in
    a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth. The
    healthcare industry is likely to continue to undergo significant
    changes for the foreseeable future, which could have an adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. We cannot predict the effect of possible future
    legislation and regulation.

Failure
    to provide quality products and services to our customers could
    have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to
    regulatory actions and costly litigation.

Quality management plays an essential role in determining and
    meeting customer requirements, preventing defects and improving
    the company’s products and services. Our future operating
    results will depend on our ability to implement and improve our
    quality management program, and effectively train and manage our
    employee base with respect to quality management. While Baxter
    has a network of quality systems throughout our business units
    and facilities, which relates to the design, development,
    manufacturing, packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution
    and labeling of our products, quality and safety issues may
    occur with respect to any of our products. In addition, some of
    the raw materials employed in Baxter’s production processes
    are derived from human and animal origins. Though great care is
    taken to assure the safety of these raw materials, the nature of
    their origin elevates the potential for the introduction of
    pathogenic agents or other contaminants.

A quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations and may
    result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary
    sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of
    products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government
    to grant approvals, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of
    existing approvals. An inability to address a quality or safety
    issue in an effective manner on a timely basis may also cause a
    loss of customer confidence in us or our products, which may
    result in losses of sales. In addition, we may be named as a
    defendant in product



liability lawsuits, which could result in costly litigation,
    reduced sales, significant liabilities and diversion of our
    management’s time, attention and resources. Even claims
    without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require
    us to incur significant legal fees.

In 2008, we removed our heparin sodium injection products from
    distribution in the United States after identifying an
    increasing level of allergic-type and hypotensive adverse
    reactions occurring in certain patients. For more information on
    this recall and the lawsuits we face in connection with this
    recall, please refer to “Certain Regulatory Matters”
    in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” of the
    Annual Report and “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — Note 11 Legal Proceedings” of
    the Annual Report.

If
    reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or
    modified, our business could suffer.

Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which
    the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance,
    managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management
    organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration
    authorities, private health coverage insurers and other
    third-party payors. These healthcare management organizations
    and third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices
    charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the
    containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal
    and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been
    targeted in this effort. We also face challenges in certain
    foreign markets where the pricing and profitability of our
    products generally are subject to government controls.
    Government controls in foreign markets also impact our ability
    to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner. Accordingly,
    our current and potential products may not be considered cost
    effective, and reimbursement to the consumer may not be
    available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a
    competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting
    reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in
    ways that are difficult to predict and these changes may be
    adverse to us. Any reduction in Medicare, Medicaid or other
    third-party payor reimbursements could have a negative effect on
    our operating results.

If we
    are unable to obtain sufficient components and/or raw materials
    on a timely basis, our business may be adversely
    affected.

The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of
    sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We
    manufacture our products in over 50 manufacturing facilities
    around the world. We acquire our components and materials from
    many suppliers in various countries. While efforts are made to
    diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain
    instances we acquire components and materials from a sole
    supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the
    continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will
    continue to be successful. In addition, due to the regulatory
    environment in which we operate, we may not be able to quickly
    establish additional or replacement sources for some components
    or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an
    inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could
    adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a
    timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product
    sales.

Consolidation
    in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

There has been consolidation in our customer base, and by our
    competitors, which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures.
    As these consolidations occur, competition to provide products
    like ours will become more intense, and the importance of
    establishing relationships with key industry participants
    including GPOs, IDNs and other customers will become greater.
    Customers will continue to work and organize to negotiate price
    reductions for our products and services. To the extent we are
    forced to reduce our prices, our business will become less
    profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding
    reductions in costs. The company’s sales could be adversely
    affected if any of its contracts with its GPOs, IDNs or other
    customers are terminated in part or in their entirety, or
    members decide to purchase from another supplier.

If we
    are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights,
    or if we infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of
    others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be
    materially damaged.

Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our
    business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our
    ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent
    rights, both in the United States and



in other countries. We cannot assure that pending patent
    applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued
    or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by
    competitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid or
    that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent
    the company from selling certain products or including key
    features in the company’s products.

The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain
    and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant
    litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our
    industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and
    validity of our patents on products or processes as well as
    allegations that our products infringe patents held by
    competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types
    of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the
    ability to market products, which could lead to a significant
    loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of
    operations.

We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and
    know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive
    positions. While we protect our proprietary rights to the extent
    possible, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know,
    discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary
    information or techniques, or that they will not gain access to
    our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.
    Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect
    unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets.
    Misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an
    adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to
    incur substantial litigation costs.

If our
    business development activities are unsuccessful, our business
    could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely
    affected.

We are engaged in business development activities including
    evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities,
    technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These
    activities may result in substantial investment of the
    company’s resources. Our success developing products or
    expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a
    number of factors, including our ability to find suitable
    opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether
    we are able to establish an acquisition, investment or alliance
    on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other
    company’s underlying technology, products and ability to
    execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and
    litigation related to these products or technology; and our
    ability to successfully integrate the acquired company,
    business, product, technology or research into our existing
    operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired
    in-process research and development projects. If we are
    unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be
    unable to meet our financial targets and we may be required to
    record asset impairment charges.

If we
    are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities or if we
    are unsuccessful in exiting low margin businesses or
    discontinuing low profit products, our business, financial
    condition and results could be adversely affected.

Successful execution of our business strategy depends, in part,
    on improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our
    current and future products. A failure to identify and take
    advantage of opportunities that allow us to increase our profit
    margins or a failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses
    or discontinue low profit margin products, may result in us
    failing to meet our financial targets and may otherwise have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

We
    face substantial competition and many of our competitors have
    significantly greater financial and other
    resources.

Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its
    businesses, Baxter faces substantial competition in each of its
    segments, from international and domestic healthcare and
    pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily
    focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product
    performance, and technological innovation. Some competitors,
    principally large pharmaceutical companies, have greater
    financial, research and development and marketing resources than
    Baxter. Competition may increase further as additional companies
    begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to
    compete directly with ours. Greater financial, research and
    development and marketing resources may allow our competitors to
    respond more quickly



to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
    requirements that may render our products obsolete or
    non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or
    affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or
    product commercialization than we do, our operations will likely
    be negatively affected.

We also face competition for marketing, distribution and
    collaborative development agreements, for establishing
    relationships with academic and research institutions, and for
    licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic
    institutions, government agencies and other public and private
    research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent
    protection and establish collaborative arrangements for
    discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of
    products similar to ours. These companies and institutions
    compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific
    and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies
    complementary to our programs. If we are unable to successfully
    compete with these companies and institutions, our business may
    suffer.

We are
    subject to risks associated with doing business
    globally.

Our operations, both within and outside the United States, are
    subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and
    under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions
    and geographies. These risks include fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates, changes in exchange controls, loss of business
    in government tenders that are held annually in many cases,
    nationalization, increasingly complex labor environments,
    expropriation and other governmental actions, changes in
    taxation, including legislative changes in United States and
    international taxation of income earned outside of the United
    States, importation limitations, export control restrictions,
    violations of U.S. or local laws, including the U.S.
    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), dependence on a few
    government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic
    destabilization, instability, disruption or destruction in a
    significant geographic region — due to the location of
    manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or
    customers — regardless of cause, including war,
    terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, or natural
    or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire,
    earthquake, storm or disease. Failure to comply with the laws
    and regulations that affect our global operations, including the
    FCPA, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition or results of operations.

We are
    subject to foreign currency exchange risk.

In 2008, we generated approximately 60% of our revenue outside
    the United States. Our financial results may be adversely
    affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
    especially in light of recent market volatility and drastic
    movements in currency exchange rates. These conditions may also
    reduce the benefits from our natural hedges and limit our
    ability to cost-effectively hedge against our foreign currency
    exposure. A discussion of the financial impact of foreign
    exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we
    attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the heading
    “Financial Instrument Market Risk” contained in
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” of the
    Annual Report. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can
    mitigate these risks.

Current
    challenges in the commercial and credit environment may
    adversely affect our business and financial
    condition.

The global financial markets have recently experienced
    unprecedented levels of volatility. The company’s ability
    to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into
    other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be
    adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand
    for the company’s products or in the solvency of its
    customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company’s key
    financial ratios or credit ratings, or other significantly
    unfavorable changes in conditions. While these conditions and
    the current economic downturn have not meaningfully impaired our
    ability to access credit markets or meaningfully adversely
    affected our operations to date, continuing volatility in the
    global financial markets could increase borrowing costs or
    affect the company’s ability to access the capital markets.
    Current or worsening economic conditions may also adversely
    affect the business of our customers, including their ability to
    pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on
    healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the
    demand for our products and services, longer sales cycles,
    slower adoption of new technologies and increased price
    competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain
    of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability
    to produce our products.

Controls
    and Procedures.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Baxter carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
    the participation of its Disclosure Committee and management,
    including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of Baxter’s disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)) as of December 31, 2008.
    Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by Baxter in
    the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis
    and that such information is communicated to management,
    including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer
    and its Board of Directors, to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that the company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
    2008.

Assessment
    of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Baxter included a report of management’s assessment of the
    effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2008 in its Annual Report. Baxter’s
    independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, also audited, and reported
    on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting. Management’s report and the independent
    registered public accounting firm’s audit report are
    included in the Annual Report and incorporated herein by
    reference.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in Baxter’s internal control over
    financial reporting (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2008 that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, Baxter’s internal
    control over financial reporting.

The material features of each equity compensation plan under
    which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was
    adopted without the approval of shareholders are described below.

February
    2000 Stock Option Grant

The Compensation Committee approved grants to Baxter employees
    of non-qualified stock options to purchase 5,625,114 shares
    in February 2000. As of December 31, 2008,
    602,364 shares are issuable under the February 2000 grant.
    The exercise price of these stock options is equal to the fair
    market value of Baxter common stock on the date of grant, which
    is the closing price of the common stock on the New York Stock
    Exchange on the grant date. The exercise price of the options
    may be paid in cash or in certain shares of Baxter common stock.
    All of the stock options granted under these programs have
    vested. The terms and conditions of each of these grants provide
    that the provisions of the shareholder-approved 1998 Incentive
    Compensation Program govern these stock option grants (except
    for the limit on shares available under the 1998 Program).

    Global Stock Option Plan

The 2001 Global Stock Option Plan is a broad-based plan adopted
    by Baxter’s Board of Directors in February 2001 to enable
    Baxter to make a special one-time stock option grant to eligible
    non-officer employees worldwide. On February 28, 2001,
    Baxter granted a non-qualified option to purchase
    200 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $45.515
    per share (post 2001 stock split) to approximately 44,000
    eligible employees under the 2001 Global Stock Option Plan. The
    exercise price of these options equals the closing price for
    Baxter common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the grant
    date. The options became exercisable on February 28, 2004,
    which was the third anniversary of the grant date, and expire on
    February 25, 2011. If an option holder leaves Baxter after
    the vesting date, then the option will expire three months after
    the holder leaves the company.
