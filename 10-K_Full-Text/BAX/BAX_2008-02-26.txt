Company
    Overview

Baxter develops, manufactures and markets products that save and
    sustain the lives of people with hemophilia, immune disorders,
    cancer, infectious diseases, kidney disease, trauma and other
    chronic and acute medical conditions. As a global diversified
    healthcare company, Baxter applies a unique combination of
    expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology
    to create products that advance patient care worldwide. These
    products are used by hospitals, kidney dialysis centers, nursing
    homes, rehabilitation centers, doctors’ offices, clinical
    and medical research laboratories, and by patients at home under
    physician supervision. Baxter manufactures products in 26
    countries and sells them in more than 100 countries.

Baxter International Inc. was incorporated under Delaware law in
    1931. As used in this report, except as otherwise indicated in
    information incorporated by reference, “Baxter
    International” means Baxter International Inc. and
    “Baxter”, the “company” or the
    “Company” means Baxter International and its
    consolidated subsidiaries.

Business
    Segments

The BioScience, Medication Delivery and Renal segments comprise
    Baxter’s continuing operations.

BioScience.

The BioScience business
    manufactures recombinant and plasma-based proteins to treat
    hemophilia and other bleeding disorders; plasma-based therapies
    to treat immune deficiencies, alpha

1-antitrypsin

deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute
    blood-related conditions; products for regenerative medicine,
    such as proteins used in hemostasis, wound-sealing and tissue
    regeneration; and vaccines. Effective February 28, 2007,
    the company sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities
    of its Transfusion Therapies business (TT) to an affiliate of
    TPG Capital, L.P. (TPG). Under transition agreements, the
    company will continue to provide manufacturing and a variety of
    support services to the business for a period of time after
    divestiture, which varies based on the product or service
    provided and other factors. See “Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements — Note 3 Sale of Transfusion
    Therapies Business” of Baxter’s Annual Report to
    Shareholders for fiscal year 2007 which is filed as
    Exhibit 13 to this Report on

Form 10-K

for a more detailed discussion of the TT divestiture.

Medication Delivery.

The Medication Delivery
    business manufactures products used in the delivery of fluids
    and drugs to patients. These include intravenous
    (IV) solutions and administration sets, premixed drugs and
    drug-reconstitution systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for
    injectable drugs, IV nutrition products, infusion pumps, and
    inhalation anesthetics, as well as products and services related
    to drug formulation and packaging technologies.

Renal.

The Renal business provides products to
    treat end-stage renal disease, or irreversible kidney failure.
    The business manufactures peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions and
    other products for PD, a home-based dialysis therapy, and also
    distributes products for hemodialysis (HD), which is generally
    conducted in a hospital or clinic.

Financial information about Baxter’s segments and principal
    product lines is incorporated by reference from the section
    entitled “Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — Note 12 Segment Information” of
    Baxter’s Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2007.

Sales and
    Distribution

The company has its own sales force and also makes sales to and
    through independent distributors, drug wholesalers acting as
    sales agents and specialty pharmacy or homecare companies. In
    the United States,


Cardinal Health, Inc. warehouses and ships a significant portion
    of the company’s products through its distribution centers.
    These centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to
    facilitate prompt customer service. Sales and distribution
    methods include frequent contact by sales representatives,
    automated communications via various electronic purchasing
    systems, circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins,
    direct-mail campaigns, trade publication presence and
    advertising.

International sales are made and products are distributed on a
    direct basis or through independent local distributors or sales
    agents in more than 100 countries. International subsidiaries
    employ their own field sales forces in Argentina, Australia,
    Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, the
    Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany,
    Greece, Guatemala, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, The
    Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, the Philippines,
    Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
    Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Venezuela.

Contractual
    Arrangements

Substantial portions of the company’s products are sold
    through contracts with customers, both within and outside the
    United States. Many of these contracts have terms of more than
    one year and place limits on price increases. In the case of
    hospitals and other facilities, these contracts may specify
    minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of
    products to be purchased by the customer. Over the years there
    has been consolidation in our customer base and as a result,
    transactions with customers are larger and more complex.

In keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in
    healthcare delivery, many hospitals and other customers of
    medical products in the United States and in other countries
    have joined group purchasing organizations (GPOs), or combined
    to form integrated delivery networks (IDNs), to enhance
    purchasing power. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements
    with manufacturers and distributors, and the negotiated prices
    are made available to members. Baxter has purchasing agreements
    with several of the major GPOs in the United States. Some of
    these GPOs have agreements with more than one supplier for
    certain products. Accordingly, in these cases, Baxter faces
    competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a
    member of a GPO under contract with Baxter.

Raw
    Materials

Raw materials essential to Baxter’s business are purchased
    worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous
    suppliers. Although most of these materials are generally
    available, certain raw materials used in producing some of the
    company’s products are available only from one or a limited
    number of suppliers, and Baxter has at times experienced
    shortages of supply. In an effort to manage risk associated with
    raw materials supply, Baxter works closely with its suppliers to
    help ensure availability and continuity of supply while
    maintaining high quality and reliability. The company also seeks
    to develop new sources of supply where beneficial to its overall
    raw materials procurement strategy.

In some situations, the company has long-term supply contracts
    with its suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and
    manage the risk of price increases. Baxter is not always able to
    recover cost increases for raw materials through customer
    pricing due to contractual limits and market pressure on such
    price increases.

Some of the raw materials employed in Baxter’s production
    processes are derived from human and animal origins. Though
    great care is taken in assuring the safety of these raw
    materials, the nature of their origin elevates the potential for
    the introduction of pathogenic agents.

As is common in new technologies including biotechnology, the
    precision and accuracy of raw material specifications is less
    mature than in other industries. This can have a potential
    impact on the ability to produce product at the quality
    standards Baxter adheres to and within Baxter’s cost
    expectations.


Competition

Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its
    businesses, Baxter faces competition in each of its segments
    from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical
    companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily focused on
    cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and
    technological innovation. There has been consolidation in the
    company’s customer base and by its competitors, which
    continues to result in pricing and market share pressures.

Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to
    exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world
    utilize various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures,
    such as price controls, product formularies (lists of
    recommended or approved products), and competitive tenders which
    require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of
    Baxter’s products are dependent, in part, on the
    availability of reimbursement by government agencies and
    healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other
    private payers. Many state governments have adopted or proposed
    initiatives relating to Medicaid and other health programs that
    may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that Baxter and
    other providers are required to pay to the state. In addition to
    government regulation, managed care organizations in the United
    States, which include medical insurance companies, medical plan
    administrators,

health-maintenance

organizations, hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy
    benefit managers, continue to put pressure on the price and
    usage of healthcare products. Managed care organizations seek to
    contain healthcare expenditures, and their purchasing strength
    has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer,
    larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients.
    Baxter faces similar issues outside of the United States. In
    Europe and some other markets, for example, the government
    provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its
    expenditures by regulating prices or limiting reimbursement or
    patient access to certain products.

Baxter faces competition from global and regional companies both
    large and small in each of the markets in which it participates.
    BioScience continues to face competitors from pharmaceutical,
    biotechnology and other companies. Medication Delivery faces
    competition from medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical
    companies particularly in the multi-source generics and
    anesthetics markets. In Renal, global and regional competitors
    continue to expand their manufacturing capacity for PD products
    and their PD sales and marketing channels.

Baxter’s Medication Delivery, BioScience and Renal
    businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of
    competitive advantages. The Medication Delivery business
    benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering, as
    well as strong relationships with customers, including
    hospitals, customer purchasing groups and pharmaceutical
    companies. The BioScience business benefits from a number of
    competitive advantages, such as continued innovation of products
    and services, consistency of its supply of products, and strong
    customer relationships. Baxter’s Renal business benefits
    from its position as one of the world’s leading
    manufacturer of PD products, as well as its strong relationships
    with customers and patients, including the many patients who
    self-administer the home-based therapy supplied by Baxter.
    Baxter also benefits from cost advantages as a result of shared
    manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its
    products.

Intellectual
    Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to
    Baxter’s business. Baxter also relies on trademarks,
    copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and confidentiality
    agreements to develop, maintain and strengthen its competitive
    position. Baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks
    throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements
    relating to various third-party patents and technologies.
    Products manufactured by Baxter are sold primarily under its own
    trademarks and trade names. Some products distributed by the
    company are sold under the company’s trade names while
    others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers. Trade
    secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary
    information is also important to Baxter. The company maintains
    certain details about its processes, products, and technology as
    trade secrets and generally requires employees, consultants,
    parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners
    to enter into confidentiality agreements.

Baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology
    through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis. This
    protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such
    protection against obtaining the


greatest value for the company. Baxter also recognizes the need
    to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks. Baxter
    will continue to take commercially reasonable steps to enforce
    its patents and trademarks around the world against potential
    infringers.

Baxter cannot assure that pending patent applications will
    result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will
    not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that Baxter
    patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual
    property rights of others will not prevent the company from
    selling certain products or including key features in the
    company’s products.

Baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent
    litigation. At any given time, the company generally is involved
    as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent
    infringement and other intellectual-property related actions.
    Such litigation can result in significant royalty or other
    payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of
    products.

Research
    and Development

Baxter’s investment in research and development is
    essential to its future growth. Accordingly, Baxter is
    increasing its investment in research and development programs
    to develop innovative products, systems and manufacturing
    methods. Expenditures for Baxter’s research and development
    activities were $760 million in 2007, $614 million in
    2006 and $533 million in 2005. These expenditures include
    costs associated with research and development activities
    performed at the company’s research and development centers
    located around the world including facilities in Austria,
    Belgium, France, Japan and the United States, as well as
    in-licensing, milestone and reimbursement payments made to
    partners for research and development work performed at
    non-Baxter locations.

Principal areas of strategic focus for research and development
    include recombinant therapeutics, adult stem-cell therapy,
    plasma-based therapeutics, initiatives in regenerative medicine,
    small molecule drugs, enhanced packaging systems for medication
    delivery, kidney dialysis, drug formulation technologies and
    sterilization technologies. The company’s research efforts
    emphasize self-manufactured product development, and portions of
    that research relate to multiple product lines. Baxter
    supplements its own research and development efforts by
    acquiring various technologies and entering into development
    agreements with third parties. For example, Baxter is involved
    in partnerships with both Nektar Therapeutics and Lipoxen
    Technologies to leverage each company’s expertise in
    developing longer-acting Factor XIII and Factor IX therapies to
    reduce the frequency of injections required to treat
    blood-clotting disorders.

Baxter’s competitors will continue to introduce competitive
    products. The company’s research and development efforts
    are essential to remaining competitive in all three of its
    business segments. The development and acquisition of innovative
    products and technologies that improve efficacy, safety,
    patients’ ease of use and cost-effectiveness are important
    to Baxter’s success. The success of new product offerings
    will depend on many factors, including the company’s
    ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs,
    obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, develop and
    manufacture products in an economical and timely manner, and
    differentiate its products from those of its competitors.

Quality
    Management

Baxter places significant emphasis on providing quality products
    and services to its customers. Quality management plays an
    essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements,
    preventing defects and improving the company’s products and
    services. Baxter has a network of quality systems throughout the
    company’s business units and facilities which relate to the
    design, development, manufacturing, packaging, sterilization,
    handling, distribution and labeling of the company’s
    products. To assess and facilitate compliance with applicable
    requirements, the company regularly reviews its quality systems
    to determine their effectiveness and identify areas for
    improvement. Baxter also performs assessments of its suppliers
    of raw materials, components and finished goods. In addition,
    the company conducts quality management reviews designed to
    inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of
    products and services.

From time to time, the company may determine that products
    manufactured or marketed by the company do not meet company
    specifications, published standards, such as those issued by the
    International Standards


Organization, or regulatory requirements. When a quality issue
    is identified, Baxter investigates such issue and takes
    appropriate corrective action, such as withdrawal of the product
    from the market, correction of the product at the customer
    location, notice to the customer of revised labeling, and other
    actions. For more information on corrective actions taken by
    Baxter, please refer to our discussion under the caption
    entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” of
    Baxter’s Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2007.

Government
    Regulation

The operations of Baxter and many of the products manufactured
    or sold by the company are subject to extensive regulation by
    numerous governmental agencies, both within and outside the
    United States. In the United States, the federal agencies that
    regulate the company’s facilities, operations, employees,
    products (their manufacture, sale, import and export) and
    services include: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA), the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Environmental Protection
    Agency, the Occupational Health & Safety
    Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of
    Labor, the Department of Defense, Customs and Border Protection,
    the Department of Commerce, the Department of Treasury and
    others. Because Baxter supplies products and services to
    healthcare providers that are reimbursed by federally funded
    programs such as Medicare, its activities are also subject to
    regulation by the Center for Medicare/Medicaid Services and
    enforcement by the Office of the Inspector General within the
    Department of Health and Human Services. State agencies also
    regulate the facilities, operations, employees, products and
    services of the company within their respective states.
    Government agencies outside the United States also regulate
    public health, product registration, manufacturing,
    environmental conditions, labor, exports, imports and other
    aspects of the company’s global operations.

The FDA in the United States, as well as other governmental
    agencies inside and outside of the United States, administer
    requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness,
    manufacturing, labeling, promotion and advertising, distribution
    and post-market surveillance of Baxter’s products. The
    company must obtain specific approval from the FDA and

non-U.S. regulatory

authorities before it can market and sell most of its products
    in a particular country. Even after the company obtains
    regulatory approval to market a product, the product and the
    company’s manufacturing processes are subject to continued
    review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.

The company is subject to possible administrative and legal
    actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Such actions
    may include product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to
    halt manufacture and distribution, and other civil and criminal
    sanctions. From time to time, the company institutes compliance
    actions, such as removing products from the market that were
    found not to meet applicable requirements and improving the
    effectiveness of quality systems. For more information on
    compliance actions taken by the company, please refer to our
    discussion under the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory
    Matters” in “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis” of Baxter’s Annual Report to Shareholders
    for fiscal year 2007.

Environmental policies of the company require compliance with
    all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate, among
    other things, appropriate capital expenditures for environmental
    protection.

International
    Markets

Baxter generates more than 55% of its revenues outside the
    United States. While healthcare cost containment continues to be
    a focus around the world, demand for healthcare products and
    services continues to be strong worldwide, particularly in
    developing markets. The company’s strategies emphasize
    global expansion and technological innovation to advance medical
    care worldwide. International operations are subject to certain
    additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the
    United States, such as changes in currency exchange rates, price
    and currency exchange controls, import restrictions, dependence
    on a few governmental entities as customers, loss of business in
    governmental tenders that are held annually in many cases,
    nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action,
    violations of U.S. or local laws as well as volatile
    economic, social and political conditions in certain countries.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider
    the following risk factors. If any of the events described below
    occurs, our business, financial condition and results of
    operations and future growth prospects could suffer.

If we
    are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to
    keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be adversely
    affected.

The successful and timely implementation of our business model
    depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and
    introduce new products. The success of new product offerings
    will depend on many factors, including our ability to properly
    anticipate and satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatory
    approvals on a timely basis, develop and manufacture products in
    an economic and timely manner, maintain advantageous positions
    with respect to intellectual property, and differentiate our
    products from those of our competitors. A failure by us to
    introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce
    these products on schedule could have an adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

The development and acquisition of innovative products and
    technologies that improve efficacy, safety, patients’ ease
    of use and cost-effectiveness are important to Baxter’s
    success and involve significant technical and business risks. If
    we cannot adapt to changing technologies, our products may
    become obsolete, and our business could suffer. Because the
    healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological
    change, we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current
    and potential customers’ requirements. Our success will
    depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our
    existing products, develop new technology that addresses the
    increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective
    customers, license or acquire leading technologies and respond
    to technological advances and emerging industry standards and
    practices on a timely and cost-effective basis.

If our
    business development activities are unsuccessful, our business
    could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely
    affected.

We are engaged in business development activities including
    evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities,
    technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These
    activities may result in substantial investment of the
    company’s resources. Our success developing products from
    such activities will depend on a number of factors, including
    our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition,
    investment or alliance, whether we are able to establish an
    acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are
    satisfactory to us, the strength of the other company’s
    underlying technology, products and its ability to execute its
    business strategies, any intellectual property and litigation
    related to these products or technology, and our ability to
    successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product,
    technology or research into our existing operations including
    the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and
    development projects. If we are unsuccessful in our business
    development activities, we may be unable to meet our financial
    targets and we may be required to record asset impairment
    charges.

If we
    are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities or if we
    are unsuccessful in exiting low margin businesses or products,
    our business, financial condition and results could be adversely
    affected.

Successful execution of our business strategy depends, in part,
    on improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our
    current and future products. A failure to identify and take
    advantage of opportunities which allow us to increase our profit
    margins or a failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses
    or


terminate low profit margin products, may result in us failing
    to meet our financial targets and may otherwise have an adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

We are
    subject to a number of existing laws and regulations,
    non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations, and we are
    susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.

As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and
    products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous
    governmental agencies, both within and outside the United
    States. The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are
    subject to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a
    number of situations, even though we may not be directly
    regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our
    products must be capable of being used by our customers in a
    manner that complies with those laws and regulations.

The manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products are
    subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA and other
    regulatory authorities both within and outside the United
    States. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous
    clinical testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming
    procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory
    authorities. We may elect to delay or cancel our anticipated
    regulatory submissions for new indications for our current or
    proposed new products for a number of reasons. Failure to comply
    with the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities
    could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures,
    monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and
    distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal
    of a government to grant approvals, restrictions on operations
    or withdrawal of existing approvals. Any of these actions could
    cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products,
    which could adversely affect our sales.

We continue to address issues with our infusion pumps as
    discussed further under the caption entitled “Certain
    Regulatory Matters” in “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis” of Baxter’s Annual Report to
    Shareholders for fiscal year 2007. There can be no assurance
    that we will resolve these pump issues without incurring
    additional charges or facing any of the sanctions available to
    the FDA under the Consent Decree entered into with the FDA
    concerning our infusion pumps. Third parties may file claims
    against us in connection with these pump issues. In addition,
    sales of these products may continue to be affected and sales of
    related products may be adversely affected if we do not
    adequately address these pump issues.

In addition, the healthcare regulatory environment may change in
    a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth. The
    healthcare industry is likely to continue to undergo significant
    changes for the foreseeable future, which could have an adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. We cannot predict the effect of possible future
    legislation and regulation.

If
    reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or
    modified, our business could suffer.

Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which
    the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance,
    managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management
    organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration
    authorities, private health coverage insurers and other
    third-party payors. These healthcare management organizations
    and third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices
    charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the
    containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal
    and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been
    targeted in this effort. We also face challenges in certain
    foreign markets where the pricing and profitability of our
    products generally are subject to government controls.
    Accordingly, our current and potential products may not be
    considered cost effective, and reimbursement to the consumer may
    not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products
    on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting
    reimbursement for our products may change at any time, including
    in ways that are adverse to us. Any reduction in Medicare,
    Medicaid or other third-party payor reimbursements could have a
    negative effect on our operating results.


If we
    are unable to obtain sufficient components and/or raw materials
    on a timely basis, our business may be adversely
    affected.

The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of
    sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We
    manufacture our products in over 50 manufacturing facilities
    around the world. We acquire our components and materials from
    many suppliers in various countries. Efforts are made to
    diversify our sources of components and materials, however, in
    certain instances, we acquire components and materials from a
    sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the
    continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will
    continue to be successful. In addition, due to the regulatory
    environment in which we operate, we may not be able to quickly
    establish additional or replacement sources for some components
    or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an
    inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could
    adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a
    timely or cost effective manner and our ability to make product
    sales.

Failure
    to provide quality products and services to our customers could
    have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to
    regulatory actions and costly litigation.

Our future operating results will depend on our ability to
    implement and improve our quality management program, and
    effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to
    quality management. Quality management plays an essential role
    in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing
    defects and improving the company’s products and services.
    While Baxter has a network of quality systems throughout our
    business units and facilities, which relates to the design,
    development, manufacturing, packaging, sterilization, handling,
    distribution and labeling of our products, quality and safety
    issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality
    or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations and may result in
    warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary
    sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of
    products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government
    to grant approvals, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of
    existing approvals. In addition, we may be named as a defendant
    in product liability lawsuits, which could result in costly
    litigation, reduced sales, significant liabilities and diversion
    of our management’s time, attention and resources. Even
    claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and
    require us to incur significant legal fees.

Consolidation
    in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

There has been consolidation in our customer base, and by our
    competitors, which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures.
    As these consolidations occur, competition to provide products
    like ours will become more intense, and the importance of
    establishing relationships with key industry participants
    including GPOs and IDNs will become greater. Customers will
    continue to work and organize to negotiate price reductions for
    our products and services. To the extent we are forced to reduce
    our prices, our business will become less profitable unless we
    are able to achieve corresponding reductions in our expenses.
    The company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of
    its contracts with its GPOs or IDNs are terminated in part or in
    their entirety, or members decide to purchase from another
    supplier.

If we
    are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or
    if we infringe upon the patents or other proprietary rights of
    others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be
    materially damaged.

Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our
    business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our
    ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent
    rights, both in the United States and in other countries. The
    patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and
    involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant
    litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our
    industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and
    validity of our patents on products or processes as well as
    allegations that our products infringe patents held by
    competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types
    of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the
    ability to market products, which could lead to a significant
    loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of
    operations.


We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and
    know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive
    positions. While we protect our proprietary rights to the extent
    possible, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know,
    discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary
    information or techniques, that they will not gain access to our
    trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.
    Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect
    unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets.
    Misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an
    adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to
    incur substantial litigation costs.

We
    face substantial competition and many of our competitors have
    significantly greater financial and other
    resources.

Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its
    businesses, Baxter faces substantial competition in each of its
    segments, from international and domestic healthcare and
    pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily
    focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product
    performance, and technological innovation. Some competitors,
    principally large pharmaceutical companies, have greater
    financial, research and development and marketing resources than
    Baxter. Competition may increase further as additional companies
    begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to
    compete directly with ours. Greater financial, research and
    development and marketing resources may allow our competitors to
    respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes
    in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete
    or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or
    affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or
    product commercialization than we do, our operations will likely
    be negatively affected.

We also face competition for marketing, distribution and
    collaborative development agreements, for establishing
    relationships with academic and research institutions, and for
    licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic
    institutions, government agencies and other public and private
    research organizations also may conduct research, seek patent
    protection and establish collaborative arrangements for
    discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of
    products similar to ours. These companies and institutions
    compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific
    and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies
    complementary to our programs. If we are unable to successfully
    compete with these companies and institutions our business may
    suffer.

We are
    subject to risks associated with doing business
    globally.

Our operations, both within and outside the United States, are
    subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and
    under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions
    and geographies. These risks include fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates, nationalization, expropriation and other
    governmental actions, importation limitations, violations of
    U.S. or local laws, dependence on a few governmental
    entities as customers, loss of business in governmental tenders
    that are held annually in many cases, pricing restrictions,
    economic destabilization, instability, disruption or destruction
    in a significant geographic region — due to the
    location of manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or
    customers — regardless of cause, including war,
    terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, or natural
    or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire,
    earthquake, storm or disease.

Controls
    and Procedures.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Baxter carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
    the participation of its Disclosure Committee and management,
    including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of Baxter’s disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)) as of December 31, 2007.
    Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by Baxter in
    the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis
    and that such information is communicated to management,
    including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer
    and its Board of Directors, to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that the company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
    2007.

Assessment
    of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Baxter included a report of management’s assessment of the
    effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2007 in its Annual Report to
    Shareholders for fiscal year 2007. Baxter’s independent
    auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, also audited, and reported on, the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
    Management’s report and the independent registered public
    accounting firm’s audit report are included in
    Baxter’s Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2007
    and incorporated herein by reference.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in Baxter’s internal control over
    financial reporting (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2007 that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, Baxter’s internal
    control over financial reporting.

    have a weighted-average exercise price of $40.90 and a
    weighted-average remaining term of 5.7 years,
    1,116,059 shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock
    units, and 769,225 shares issuable upon vesting of
    performance share units.

The material features of each equity compensation plan under
    which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was
    adopted without the approval of shareholders are described below.

    Global Stock Option Plan

The 2001 Global Stock Option Plan is a broad-based plan adopted
    by Baxter’s Board of Directors in February 2001 to enable
    Baxter to make a special one-time stock option grant to eligible
    non-officer employees worldwide. On February 28, 2001,
    Baxter granted a non-qualified option to purchase
    200 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $45.515
    per share (post 2001 stock split) to approximately 44,000
    eligible employees under the 2001 Global Stock Option Plan. The
    exercise price of these options equals the closing price for
    Baxter common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the grant
    date. The options became exercisable on February 28, 2004,
    which was the third anniversary of the grant date, and expire on
    February 25, 2011. If an option holder leaves Baxter after
    the vesting date, then the option will expire three months after
    the holder leaves the company.

Other
    Stock Option Grants Not Approved by Shareholders

The Compensation Committee approved grants to Baxter employees
    of non-qualified stock options to purchase 4,305,501 shares
    in February 1998 and 5,625,114 shares in February 2000. As
    of December 31, 2007, 218,366 shares are issuable
    under the February 1998 grant and 1,029,904 shares are
    issuable under the February 2000 grant. The exercise price of
    these stock options is equal to the fair market value of Baxter
    common stock on the date of grant, which is the closing price of
    the common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the grant
    date. The exercise price of the options may be paid in cash or
    in certain shares of Baxter common stock. All of the stock
    options granted under these programs have vested. The terms and
    conditions of each of these grants provide that the provisions
    of the shareholder-approved 1998 Incentive Compensation Program
    govern these stock option grants (except for the limit on shares
    available under the 1998 Program).
