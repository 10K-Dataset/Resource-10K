PART I

Item 1.

Business.

Company Overview

Baxter assists healthcare professionals and their patients with
the treatment of complex medical conditions, including
hemophilia, immune disorders, infectious diseases, cancer,
kidney disease, trauma and other conditions. The company applies
its expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and
biotechnology to make a meaningful difference in patients’
lives. Baxter’s products are used by hospitals, clinical
and medical research laboratories, blood and plasma collection
centers, kidney dialysis centers, rehabilitation centers,
nursing homes, doctors’ offices and by patients at home
under physician supervision. Baxter manufactures products in 28
countries and sells them in over 100 countries.

Baxter International Inc. was incorporated under Delaware law in
1931. As used in this report, except as otherwise indicated in
information incorporated by reference, “Baxter
International” means Baxter International Inc. and
“Baxter” or the “company” means Baxter
International and its subsidiaries.

Business Segments

The Medication Delivery, BioScience and Renal segments comprise
Baxter’s continuing operations. Unless otherwise indicated,
each of the factors discussed in Part I do not materially
differ in their impact across each of the three segments.

Medication Delivery.

The Medication Delivery business is
a manufacturer of intravenous (IV) solutions and
administration sets, premixed drugs and drug reconstitution
systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for injectable drugs,
electronic infusion pumps, and other products used to deliver
fluids and drugs to patients. The business also provides IV
nutrition solutions, containers and compounding systems and
services, general anesthetic agents and critical care drugs,
contract manufacturing services, and drug packaging and
formulation technologies.

BioScience.

The BioScience business manufactures
plasma-based and recombinant proteins used to treat hemophilia,
and other biopharmaceutical products, including plasma-based
therapies to treat immune disorders, alpha 1 antitrypsin
deficiency and other chronic blood-related conditions,
biosurgery products for hemostasis, wound-sealing, and tissue
regeneration, and vaccines. The business also manufactures
manual and automated blood and blood-component separation and
collection systems.

Renal.

The Renal business manufactures products for
peritoneal dialysis (PD), a home therapy for people with
end-stage renal disease, or irreversible kidney failure. These
products include a range of PD solutions and related supplies to
help patients safely perform solution exchanges, as well as
automated PD cyclers that perform solution exchanges for
patients overnight while they sleep. The business also
distributes products (hemodialysis instruments and disposables,
including dialyzers) for hemodialysis, a form of dialysis
generally conducted several times a week in a hospital or clinic.

Financial information about Baxter’s segments and principal
product lines is incorporated by reference from the section
entitled “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — Note 10 Segment Information” on
pages 81-83 of Baxter’s Annual Report to Shareholders
for fiscal year 2005, which is filed as Exhibit 13 to this
Report on Form

10-K.

Sales and Distribution

Baxter International is the holding company for various
subsidiaries and divisions, many of which have their own sales
forces and direct their own sales efforts. In addition, sales
are made to and through independent distributors, drug
wholesalers acting as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or
homecare companies. In the United States, Cardinal Health, Inc.
(Cardinal Health) warehouses and ships a significant portion of
the company’s products through its distribution centers.
These centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to
facilitate prompt customer service. Sales and distribution
methods



include frequent contact by sales representatives, automated
communications via various electronic purchasing systems,
circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins, direct-mail
campaigns, trade publications and advertising.

International sales are made and products are distributed on a
direct basis or through independent local distributors in more
than 100 countries. International subsidiaries employ their own
field sales forces in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala,
India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, The Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Poland,
Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan,
Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Venezuela. In other
countries, sales are made through independent distributors or
sales agents.

Contractual Arrangements

A substantial portion of the company’s products are sold
through contracts with customers, both within and outside the
United States. Many of these contracts have terms of more than
one year and place limits on price increases. In the case of
hospitals, clinical laboratories and other facilities, these
contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product
or categories of products to be purchased by the customer. In
keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in
healthcare delivery, some hospitals and other customers of
medical products have joined group purchasing organizations
(GPOs), or combined to form integrated delivery networks (IDNs),
to enhance purchasing power. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing
arrangements with manufacturers and distributors, and the
negotiated prices are made available to members. The medical
products industry has also experienced some consolidation,
partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large
purchasers. As a result, transactions with customers are larger
and more complex. The enhanced purchasing power of these
customers increases the pressure on product pricing.

Baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major GPOs
in the United States. Some of these GPOs have agreements with
more than one supplier for certain products. Accordingly, in
these cases, Baxter faces competition from other suppliers even
where a customer is a member of a GPO under contract with
Baxter. As a result, Baxter often enters into a separate
contract directly with a customer even if the customer is a GPO
member. Baxter’s sales could be adversely affected if any
of its contracts with its GPOs or IDNs are terminated in part or
in their entirety, or members decide to purchase from another
supplier.

Raw Materials

Raw materials essential to Baxter’s business are purchased
worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous
suppliers. Although most of these materials are generally
available, certain raw materials used in producing some of the
company’s products are available only from one or a limited
number of suppliers, and Baxter has at times experienced
occasional shortages of supply. In an effort to manage risk
associated with raw materials supply, Baxter works closely with
its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of
supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. The
company also seeks to develop new sources of supply where
beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy.

In some situations, the company has long-term supply contracts
with its suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and
manage the risk of price increases. Baxter is not always able to
recover cost increases for raw materials through customer
pricing due to contractual limits and market pressure on such
price increases.

Some of the raw materials employed in Baxter’s production
processes are derived from human and animal origins. Though
every care is taken in assuring the safety of these raw
materials, the nature of their origin elevates the potential for
the introduction of pathogenic agents. Baxter believes the
production processes that employ these materials adequately
eliminate or inactivate infectious or toxic elements that may be
present in these raw materials.



As is common in new technologies including biotechnology, the
precision and accuracy of raw material specifications is less
mature than in other industries. This can have a potential
impact on the ability to produce product at the quality
standards Baxter adheres to and within Baxter’s cost
expectations.

Competition

Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its
businesses, Baxter faces substantial competition in each of its
segments from international and domestic healthcare and
pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily
focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product
performance, and technological innovation. There has been
consolidation in the company’s customer base, and by its
competitors, which has resulted in pricing and market share
pressures.

Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to
exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world
utilize various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures,
such as price controls, product formularies (lists of
recommended or approved products), and competitive tenders which
require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of
Baxter’s products are dependent, in part, on the
availability of reimbursement by government agencies and
healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other
private payers. Many state governments have adopted or proposed
initiatives relating to Medicaid and other health programs that
may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that Baxter and
other providers are required to pay to the state. In addition to
government regulation, managed care organizations (MCOs) in the
United States, which include medical insurance companies,
medical plan administrators, health-maintenance organizations,
hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers,
continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare
products. MCOs seek to contain healthcare expenditures, and
their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their
consolidation into fewer, larger organizations and a growing
number of enrolled patients. Baxter faces similar issues outside
of the United States. In Europe and some other markets, for
example, the government provides healthcare at low cost to
patients, and controls its expenditures by regulating prices or
limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products.

Baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments. In
the BioScience business, Baxter faces intense competition in the
recombinant marketplace, primarily from Bayer AG and Wyeth as
manufacturers of recombinant Factor VIII. The Medication
Delivery business expects increased pricing pressure from
generic competition for injectable drugs, and from GPOs in the
United States. The company believes that additional competitors
will continue to enter the market selling a generic form of
Rocephin, an antibiotic, and propofol, an anesthetic agent,
resulting in reductions in Baxter sales. In the Renal business,
global and regional competitors continue to expand their
manufacturing capacity for PD products and their PD sales and
marketing channels.

Baxter’s Medication Delivery, BioScience and Renal
businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of
competitive advantages. The Medication Delivery business
benefits from the breadth and depth of its product offering, as
well as strong relationships with customers, including hospitals
and acute care facilities, customer purchasing groups and
pharmaceutical companies. The BioScience business benefits from
a number of competitive advantages, such as continued innovation
of products and services, consistency of its supply of products,
and strong customer relationships. Baxter’s Renal business
benefits from its position as one of the world’s leading
manufacturer of PD products, as well as its strong relationships
with customers and patients, including the many patients who
self-administer the home-based therapy supplied by Baxter.
Baxter also benefits from cost advantages as a result of shared
manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its
products.

Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to
Baxter’s business. Baxter also relies on trademarks,
copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and confidentiality
agreements to develop, maintain and strengthen its competitive
position. Baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks
throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements
relating to various third-party patents and technologies.
Products



manufactured by Baxter are sold primarily under its own
trademarks and trade names. Some products distributed by the
company are sold under the company’s trade names while
others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers. Trade
secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary
information is also important to Baxter. The company maintains
certain details about its processes, products, and technology as
trade secrets and generally requires employees, consultants,
parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners
to enter into confidentiality agreements.

Baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology
through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis. This
protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such
protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company.
Baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of
its patents and trademarks. Baxter will continue to take
commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and
trademarks around the world against potential infringers.

Baxter cannot assure that pending patent applications will
result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will
not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that Baxter
patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual
property rights of others will not prevent the company from
selling certain products or including key features in the
company’s products.

Baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent
litigation. At any given time, the company generally is involved
as both a plaintiff and defendant in a number of patent
infringement and other intellectual-property related actions.
Such litigation can result in significant royalty or other
payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of
products.

Research and Development

Baxter’s investment in research and development is
essential to its future growth. Accordingly, Baxter is actively
engaged in research and development programs to develop
innovative products, systems and manufacturing methods.
Expenditures for Baxter’s research and development
activities relating to continuing operations were
$533 million in 2005, $517 million in 2004 and
$553 million in 2003. These activities are performed at
research and development centers located around the world and
include facilities in Austria, Belgium, France, Japan and the
United States.

Principal areas of strategic focus for research and development
include recombinant therapeutics, plasma-based therapeutics,
biosurgery products, small molecule drugs, enhanced packaging
systems for medication delivery, kidney dialysis, drug
formulation technologies and sterilization technologies. The
company’s research efforts emphasize self-manufactured
product development, and portions of that research relate to
multiple product lines. For example, research relating to the
performance and purity of medical plastic materials has resulted
in advances that are applicable to a large number of the
company’s products. Baxter supplements its own research and
development efforts by acquiring various technologies and
entering into development agreements with third parties. For
example, in 2005 we acquired the exclusive worldwide rights from
Kuros Biosurgery AG, a Swiss biotech company, to develop and
commercialize a portfolio of hard and soft tissue-repair
products.

Baxter’s competitors will continue to introduce competitive
products. The company’s research and development efforts
are essential to remaining competitive in all three of its
business segments. The development and acquisition of innovative
products and technologies that improve efficacy, safety,
patients’ ease of use and cost-effectiveness are important
to Baxter’s success. The success of new product offerings
will depend on many factors, including the company’s
ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs,
obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, develop and
manufacture products in an economical and timely manner, and
differentiate its products from those of its competitors.

Quality Management

Baxter places significant emphasis on providing quality products
and services to its customers. Quality management plays an
essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements,
preventing defects and improving the company’s products and
services. Baxter has a network of quality systems throughout



the company’s business units and facilities which relate to
the design, development, manufacturing, packaging,
sterilization, handling, distribution and labeling of the
company’s products. To assess and facilitate compliance
with applicable requirements, the company regularly reviews its
quality systems to determine their effectiveness and identify
areas for improvement. Baxter also performs assessments of its
suppliers of raw materials, components and finished goods. In
addition, the company conducts quality management reviews
designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the
quality of products and services.

In order to address matters of product quality that arise from
time to time, Baxter has developed and is implementing a global
quality system improvement strategy to review and redesign its
quality systems. This program is designed to enhance the
effectiveness of corrective and preventive actions taken in
response to quality issues that may arise with respect to the
company’s products and facilities. As a part of this
program, the company has initiated a number of organizational
changes within the quality, regulatory affairs and medical
surveillance functions. The company also is increasing its
investments in human and other resources, and has product
improvement plans in place, in order to improve the overall
quality of the company’s device portfolio. With this
renewed focus, management is providing more frequent and
informative communications to customers regarding the
company’s products, with the goal of enhancing overall
customer satisfaction.

From time to time, the company may determine that products
manufactured or marketed by the company do not meet company
specifications, published standards, such as those issued by the
International Standards Organization, or regulatory
requirements. When a quality issue is identified, Baxter will
investigate and take appropriate corrective action, such as
withdrawal of the product from the market, correction of the
product at the customer location, notice to the customer of
revised labeling, and/or other actions. Please refer to our
discussion of the COLLEAGUE infusion pump under the caption
entitled “COLLEAGUE Matter” in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis” on pages 42-43 of
Baxter’s Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2005.

Government Regulation

The operations of Baxter and many of the products manufactured
or sold by the company are subject to extensive regulation by
numerous governmental agencies, both within and outside the
United States. In the United States, the federal agencies that
regulate the company’s facilities, operations, employees,
products (their manufacture, sale, import and export) and
services include: the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Environmental Protection
Agency, the Occupational Health & Safety
Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of
Labor, the Department of Defense, Customs and Border Protection,
the Department of Commerce, the Department of Treasury and
others. Because Baxter supplies products and services to
healthcare providers that are reimbursed by federally funded
programs such as Medicare, its activities are also subject to
regulation by the Center for Medicare/ Medicaid Services and
enforcement by the Office of the Inspector General within the
Department of Health and Human Services. State agencies also
regulate the facilities, operations, employees, products and
services of the company within their respective states.
Government agencies outside the United States also regulate
public health, product registration, manufacturing,
environmental conditions, labor, exports, imports and other
aspects of the company’s global operations.

The FDA in the United States, as well as other governmental
agencies inside and outside of the United States, administer
requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness,
manufacturing, labeling, promotion and advertising, distribution
and post-market surveillance of Baxter’s products. The
company must obtain specific approval from the FDA and

non-U.S.

regulatory
authorities before it can market and sell most of its products
in a particular country. Even after the company obtains
regulatory approval to market a product, the product and the
company’s manufacturing processes are subject to continued
review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.

The company is subject to possible administrative and legal
actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Such actions
may include product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to
halt manufacture and



distribution, and other civil and criminal sanctions. From time
to time, the company has instituted compliance actions, such as
removing products from the market that were found not to meet
applicable requirements and improving the effectiveness of
quality systems. Please refer to our discussion of the COLLEAGUE
infusion pump under the caption entitled “COLLEAGUE
Matter” in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis” on pages 42-43 of Baxter’s Annual
Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2005.

Environmental policies of the company require compliance with
all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate, among
other things, appropriate capital expenditures for environmental
protection. Baxter made various non-material capital
expenditures for environmental protection during 2005 and
similar expenditures are planned for 2006.

International Markets

Baxter generates more than 50% of its revenues outside the
United States. While healthcare cost containment continues to be
a focus around the world, demand for healthcare products and
services continues to be strong worldwide, particularly in
developing markets. The company’s strategies emphasize
global expansion and technological innovation to advance medical
care worldwide. International operations are subject to certain
additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the
United States, such as changes in currency exchange rates, price
and currency exchange controls, import restrictions,
nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action,
violations of U.S. or local laws as well as volatile
economic, social and political conditions in certain countries.

including the FDA and foreign counterparts, that could delay,
limit or suspend product development, manufacturing or sale or
result in seizures, injunctions and monetary sanctions,
including with respect to the company’s infusion pumps;
product quality or patient safety issues, leading to product
recalls, withdrawals, launch delays, litigation, or declining
sales; product development risks, including satisfactory
clinical performance, the ability to manufacture at appropriate
scale, and the general unpredictability associated with the
product development cycle; demand for and market acceptance
risks for new and existing products, such as ADVATE, and other
technologies; the impact of geographic and product mix on the
company’s sales; the impact of competitive products and
pricing, including generic competition, drug reimportation and
disruptive technologies; inventory reductions or fluctuations in
buying patterns by wholesalers or distributors; the availability
of acceptable raw materials and component supply; global
regulatory, trade and tax policies; the ability to enforce
patents; patents of third parties preventing or restricting the
company’s manufacture, sale or use of affected products or
technology; reimbursement policies of government agencies and
private payers; the company’s ability to realize in a
timely manner the anticipated benefits of restructuring
initiatives; foreign currency fluctuations; change in credit
agency ratings; and other factors identified elsewhere in this
report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, including those factors described below under the
caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, all of which are
available are on the company’s website. In addition to
these risks, upon the resolution of certain legal matters,
Baxter may incur charges in excess of presently established
reserves as discussed in “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — Note 9 Legal Proceedings” on
pages 77-80 of Baxter’s Annual Report to Shareholders
for fiscal year 2005. Any such charge could have a material
adverse effect on Baxter’s results of operations or cash
flows in the period in which it is recorded.

Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the
forward-looking statements. Baxter does not undertake to update
its forward-looking statements.

Item 1A.

Risk
Factors.

In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on
Form

10-K,

shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider
the following risk factors. If any of the events described below
occurs, our business, financial condition and results of
operations and future growth prospects could suffer.

If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or
    fail to keep pace with advances in technology, our business,
    financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
    affected.

The successful and timely implementation of our business model
depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and
introduce new products. The success of new product offerings
will depend on many factors, including our ability to properly
anticipate and satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatory
approvals on a timely basis, develop and manufacture products in
an economic and timely manner, maintain advantageous positions
with respect to intellectual property, and differentiate our
products from those of our competitors. A failure by us to
introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce
these products on schedule could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.



The development and acquisition of innovative products and
technologies that improve efficacy, safety, patients’ ease
of use and cost-effectiveness are important to Baxter’s
success. If we cannot adapt to changing technologies, our
products may become obsolete, and our business could suffer.
Because the healthcare industry is characterized by rapid
technological change, we may be unable to anticipate changes in
our current and potential customers’ requirements. Our
success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to
enhance our existing products, develop new technology that
addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our
prospective customers, license or acquire leading technologies
and respond to technological advances and emerging industry
standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis.
The development of our proprietary technology entails
significant technical and business risks.

We are subject to a number of existing laws and
    regulations, non-compliance with certain of which could
    adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
    of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory
    environment.

As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and
products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous
governmental agencies, both within and outside the United
States. The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are
ourselves subject to these laws and regulations, and is also
indirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may
not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and
regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our
customers in a manner that complies with those laws and
regulations.

The manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products are
subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA. Any new
product must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and
other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated
by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. We may elect to
delay or cancel our anticipated regulatory submissions for new
indications for our current or proposed new products for a
number of reasons. Failure to comply with the requirements of
the FDA could result in warning letters, product recalls or
seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture
and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions,
refusal of the government to grant approvals, restrictions on
operations or withdrawal of existing approvals.

We are currently addressing issues with our infusion pumps that
are discussed further under the caption entitled “COLLEAGUE
Matter” in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis” on pages 42-43 of Baxter’s Annual
Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2005. Although we are
working to resolve these pump issues with the FDA and in related
litigation, we nevertheless are subject to administrative and
legal actions. These actions include product recalls, additional
product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and
distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions,
including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. Any of these
actions could have an adverse effect on our business and subject
us to additional regulatory actions including costly litigation.
There can be no assurance that we will resolve these pump issues
without incurring additional charges or facing sanctions. In
addition, our sales of other products may be adversely affected
if we experience a loss of customer confidence as a result of
these pump issues.

In addition, the healthcare regulatory environment may change in
a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth. The
healthcare industry is likely to continue to undergo significant
changes for the foreseeable future, which could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. We cannot predict the effect of possible future
legislation and regulation.

If reimbursement for our current or future products is
    reduced or modified, our business would suffer.

Sales of our products depends, in part, on the extent to which
the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance,
managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management
organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration
authorities, private health coverage insurers and other
third-party payors. These healthcare management organizations
and third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices
charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the
containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal
and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been



targeted in this effort. We also face challenges in certain
foreign markets where the pricing and profitability of our
products generally are subject to government controls.
Accordingly, our current and potential products may not be
considered cost effective, and reimbursement to the consumer may
not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products
on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting
reimbursement for our products may change at any time, including
in ways that are adverse to us. Any reduction in Medicare,
Medicaid or other third-party payor reimbursements could have a
negative effect on our operating results.

Failure to provide quality products and services to our
    customers could have an adverse effect on our business and
    subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation.

Our future operating results will depend on our ability to
implement and improve our quality management program, and
effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to
quality management. We place significant emphasis on providing
quality products and services to our customers. Quality
management plays an essential role in determining and meeting
customer requirements, preventing defects and improving the
company’s products and services. While Baxter has a network
of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities,
which relate to the design, development, manufacturing,
packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution and labeling of
our products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect
to any of our products. A quality or safety issue could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations and may result in any of the actions described
above on page 5. In addition, we may be named as a
defendant in product liability lawsuits, which could result in
costly litigation, reduced sales, significant liabilities and
diversion of our management’s time, attention and
resources. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse
publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees.

Consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely
    affect our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

There has been consolidation in our customer base, and by our
competitors, which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures.
As these consolidations occur, competition to provide products
like ours will become more intense, and the importance of
establishing relationships with key industry participants will
become greater. Customers will continue to work and organize to
negotiate price reductions for our products and services. To the
extent we are forced to reduce our prices, our business will
become less profitable unless we were able to achieve
corresponding reductions in our expenses.

If we are unable to protect our patents and other
    proprietary rights or infringe upon the patents or other
    proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business
    prospects may be materially damaged.

Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our
business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our
ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent
rights, both in the U.S. and in other countries. The patent
position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves
complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation
concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry.
Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of
our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that
our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third
parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a
loss of patent protection or the ability to market products,
which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise
materially affect future results of operations.

We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and
know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive
positions. While we protect our proprietary rights to the extent
possible, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know,
discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary
information or techniques, that they will not gain access to our
trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect
unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets.
Misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an
adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to
incur substantial litigation costs.



We have many competitors, several of which have
    significantly greater financial and other resources.

Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its
businesses, Baxter faces substantial competition in each of its
segments, from international and domestic healthcare and
pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily
focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product
performance, and technological innovation. Some competitors,
principally large pharmaceutical companies, have greater
financial, research and development and marketing resources than
Baxter. Competition may increase further as additional companies
begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to
compete directly with ours. Greater financial, research and
development and marketing resources may allow our competitors to
respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes
in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete
or non-competitive.

If our competitors develop more effective or affordable
    products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product
    commercialization than we do, our operations will likely be
    negatively affected.

We also face competition for marketing, distribution and
collaborative development agreements, for establishing
relationships with academic and research institutions, and for
licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic
institutions, government agencies and other public and private
research organizations also may conduct research, seek patent
protection and establish collaborative arrangements for
discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of
products similar to ours. These companies and institutions
compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific
and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies
complementary to our programs.

We are subject to risks associated with doing business
    internationally.

Our foreign operations are subject to risks which are inherent
in conducting business overseas and under foreign laws,
regulations and customs. These risks include possible
nationalization, expropriation, importation limitations,
violations of U.S. or local laws, pricing restrictions, and
other restrictive governmental actions or economic
destabilization, instability, disruption or destruction in a
significant geographic region — due to the location of
manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or
customers — regardless of cause, including war,
terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; and
natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire,
earthquake, storm or disease. Also, fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates can impact our consolidated financial
results.

Properties.

Baxter’s corporate offices are located at One Baxter
Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois 60015.

Baxter owns or has long-term leases on substantially all of its
major manufacturing facilities. With respect to its continuing
operations, the company maintains 28 manufacturing facilities in
the United States and its territories, including six in Puerto
Rico. The company also manufactures in Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, the
Dominican Republic, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy,
Japan, Malta, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Poland,
Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey and the United
Kingdom. While the majority of these facilities are shared by
more than one of the company’s business segments, nine
domestic facilities and 17 international facilities exclusively
manufacture for the Medication Delivery operations; 12 domestic
and 16 international facilities exclusively manufacture for
BioScience operations; and the Renal business is the exclusive
operator of one domestic and four international facilities. The
company also owns or operates shared distribution facilities
throughout the world, including 12 in the United States and
Puerto Rico and 119 located in 34 foreign countries.



The company continually evaluates its plants and production
lines and believes that its current facilities plus any planned
expansions are generally sufficient to meet its expected needs
and expected near-term growth. Expansion projects and facility
closings will be undertaken as necessary in response to market
needs.

Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Baxter carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of the its Disclosure Committee and
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Baxter’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules

13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”)) as of December 31, 2005. Baxter’s
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by Baxter in the reports it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported on a timely basis and that such
information is communicated to management, including the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and its Board of
Directors to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures are effective as of December 31,
2005.

Assessment of Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

    Compensation Program. Although the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
    for International Employees and the 2001 Incentive Compensation
    Program have been approved by the company’s shareholders,
    the additional shares in (i) and (ii) have been
    approved by the company’s Board of Directors but not by the
    company’s shareholders.

The material features of each equity compensation plan under
which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was
adopted without the approval of shareholders are described below.

2001 Global Stock Option Plan

The 2001 Global Stock Option Plan is a broad-based plan that was
adopted by Baxter’s Board of Directors in February 2001 to
enable Baxter to make a special one-time stock option grant to
eligible non-officer employees worldwide. On February 28,
2001, Baxter granted a non-qualified option to
purchase 200 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price of $45.515 per share to approximately 44,000 eligible
employees under the 2001 Global Stock Option Plan. The exercise
price of these options equals the closing price for Baxter
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the grant date.
The options became exercisable on February 28, 2004, which
was the third anniversary of the grant date, and expire on
February 25, 2011. If an option holder leaves Baxter after
the vesting date, then the option will expire three months after
the holder leaves the company.

Other Stock Option Grants Not Approved by
    Shareholders

Baxter has made several stock option grants outside of the
Programs approved by shareholders. However, the terms and
conditions of each of these grants provide that the provisions
of either the 1994 Incentive Compensation Program or the 1998
Incentive Compensation Program, as the case may be, govern these
stock option grants (except for the limit on shares available
under these Programs). Accordingly, the terms and conditions of
these grants are consistent with the terms of the Programs,
which were previously approved by shareholders.

The Compensation Committee approved the following grants of
non-qualified stock options: options to
purchase 1,685,538 shares granted in February 1997 to
Baxter employees (the “February 1997 Grant”); options
to purchase 13,588 shares granted in November 1997 to
members of Baxter’s scientific advisory board (the
“Scientific Advisory Board Grant”); options to
purchase 2,621,855 shares granted in November 1997 to
Baxter employees (the “November 1997 Grant”); options
to purchase 4,305,501 shares granted in February 1998
to Baxter employees (the “February 1998 Grant”); and
options to purchase 5,625,114 shares granted in
February 2000 to Baxter employees (the “February 2000
Grant”).

The exercise price of these stock options is equal to the fair
market value of Baxter Common Stock on the date of grant, which
is the closing sale price of the Common Stock as reported on the
New York Stock Exchange composite reporting tape on the grant
date. The exercise price of the options may be paid in cash or
in certain shares of Baxter Common Stock. All of the stock
options granted under these programs have vested as of the date
hereof.

The February 1997 Grant options expire on the earlier of
(1) one year after death or disability; (2) five years
after termination of employment by retirement at or after
age 55; (3) three months after termination of
employment (except as provided in (1) and (2) above),
unless the holder dies or becomes disabled during the
three-month period in which case the option shall expire one
year after termination of employment; or (4) ten years
after the grant date.



The November 1997 Grant, February 1998 Grant and February 2000
Grant options expire on the earlier of (1) one year after
death or disability; (2) five years after termination of
employment if, on the employment termination date, the holder is
age 50 or older and has completed 15 or more years of
employment with the company; (3) three months after
termination of employment (except as provided in (1) and
(2) above), unless the holder dies or becomes disabled
during the three-month period in which case the option shall
expire one year after termination of employment; or (4) ten
years after the grant date.

The Scientific Advisory Board Grant options expire on the
earlier of (1) one year after death or disability;
(2) three months after termination of service for a reason
other than death or disability, unless the holder dies or
becomes disabled during the three-month period in which case the
option shall expire one year after termination of employment; or
(3) ten years after the grant date.
