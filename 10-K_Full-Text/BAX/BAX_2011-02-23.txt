Company
    Overview

Baxter International Inc., through its subsidiaries, develops,
    manufactures and markets products that save and sustain the
    lives of people with hemophilia, immune disorders, infectious
    diseases, kidney disease, trauma, and other chronic and acute
    medical conditions. As a global, diversified healthcare company,
    Baxter applies a unique combination of expertise in medical
    devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to create products
    that advance patient care worldwide. These products are used by
    hospitals, kidney dialysis centers, nursing homes,
    rehabilitation centers, doctors’ offices, clinical and
    medical research laboratories, and by patients at home under
    physician supervision. Baxter manufactures products in 27
    countries and sells them in more than 100 countries.

Baxter International Inc. was incorporated under Delaware law in
    1931. As used in this report, except as otherwise indicated in
    information incorporated by reference, “Baxter
    International” means Baxter International Inc. and
    “Baxter,” the “company” or the
    “Company” means Baxter International and its
    consolidated subsidiaries.

Business
    Segments and Products

The BioScience, Medication Delivery and Renal segments comprise
    Baxter’s continuing operations.

BioScience.

The BioScience business processes
    recombinant and plasma-based proteins to treat hemophilia and
    other bleeding disorders; plasma-based therapies to treat immune
    deficiencies, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, burns and shock,
    and other chronic and acute blood-related conditions; products
    for regenerative medicine, such as biosurgery products; and
    select vaccines.

Medication Delivery.

The Medication Delivery
    business manufactures intravenous (IV) solutions and
    administration sets, premixed drugs and drug-reconstitution
    systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for injectable drugs, IV
    nutrition products, infusion pumps, and inhalation anesthetics.
    The business also provides products and services related to
    pharmacy compounding, drug formulation and packaging
    technologies. In October 2010, the company announced an
    agreement providing for the divestiture of its U.S. generic
    injectables business to Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC. For more
    information on this divestiture, see Note 3 in Item 8
    of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Renal.

The Renal business provides products to
    treat end-stage renal disease, or irreversible kidney failure.
    The business manufactures solutions and other products for
    peritoneal dialysis (PD), a home-based therapy, and also
    distributes products for hemodialysis, which is generally
    conducted in a hospital or clinic.

In October 2010, the company announced the combination of its
    Medication Delivery and Renal businesses into a single global
    business unit, Medical Products.

For financial information about Baxter’s segments and
    principal product categories, see Note 12 in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Sales and
    Distribution

The company has its own direct sales force and also makes sales
    to and through independent distributors, drug wholesalers acting
    as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or homecare companies. In
    the United States, Cardinal Health, Inc. warehouses and ships a
    significant portion of the company’s products through its
    distribution centers. These centers are generally stocked with
    adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service.
    Sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales
    representatives, automated communications via various electronic
    purchasing systems, circulation of catalogs and merchandising
    bulletins, direct-mail campaigns, trade publication presence and
    advertising.


International sales are made and products are distributed on a
    direct basis or through independent local distributors or sales
    agents in more than 100 countries.

International
    Operations

Baxter products are manufactured and sold worldwide.
    Approximately 60% of the company’s revenues are generated
    outside of the United States and geographic expansion remains a
    core component of the company’s strategy. Baxter’s
    international presence includes operations in Europe,
    Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada. The company is subject
    to certain risks inherent in conducting business outside the
    United States. For more information on these risks, see the
    information under the captions “We are subject to risks
    associated with doing business globally” and “We are
    subject to foreign currency risk” in Item 1A of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

all of which information is incorporated herein by reference.

For financial information about foreign and domestic operations
    and geographic information, see Note 12 in Item 8 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

For more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk,
    refer to the discussion under the caption entitled
    “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in Item 7 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Contractual
    Arrangements

Substantial portions of the company’s products are sold
    through contracts with customers, both within and outside the
    United States. Some of these contracts have terms of more than
    one year and place limits on the company’s ability to
    increase prices. In the case of hospitals, governments and other
    facilities, these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a
    particular product or categories of products to be purchased by
    the customer.

In keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in
    healthcare delivery, many hospitals and other customers of
    medical products in the United States and in other countries
    have joined group purchasing organizations (GPOs), or formed
    integrated delivery networks (IDNs), to enhance purchasing
    power. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with
    manufacturers and distributors, and the negotiated prices are
    made available to members. Baxter has purchasing agreements with
    several of the major GPOs in the United States. GPOs may have
    agreements with more than one supplier for certain products.
    Accordingly, in these cases, Baxter faces competition from other
    suppliers even where a customer is a member of a GPO under
    contract with Baxter.

Raw
    Materials

Raw materials essential to Baxter’s business are purchased
    from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of
    business. Although most of these materials are generally
    available, certain raw materials used in producing some of the
    company’s products are available only from one or a limited
    number of suppliers, and Baxter at times may experience
    shortages of supply. In an effort to manage risk associated with
    raw materials supply, Baxter works closely with its suppliers to
    help ensure availability and continuity of supply while
    maintaining high quality and reliability. The company also seeks
    to develop new and alternative sources of supply where
    beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy.

The company also utilizes long-term supply contracts with some
    suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the
    risk of price increases. Baxter is not always able to recover
    cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to
    contractual limits and market forces.

Competition
    and Healthcare Cost Containment

Baxter’s BioScience, Medication Delivery and Renal
    businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of
    competitive advantages. The BioScience business benefits from
    continued innovation in its products and therapies, consistency
    of its supply of products, and strong customer relationships.
    The Medication Delivery business benefits from the breadth and
    depth of its product offering, as well as strong relationships
    with customers, including hospitals, customer purchasing groups
    and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The Renal
    business benefits from its position as one of the world’s
    leading manufacturers of PD products, as


well as its strong relationships with customers and patients,
    including the many patients who self-administer the home-based
    therapy supplied by Baxter. Baxter as a whole benefits from
    efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared
    manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its
    products.

Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its
    businesses, Baxter faces substantial competition in each of its
    segments from international and domestic healthcare and
    pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. BioScience continues to
    face competitors from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other
    companies. Medication Delivery faces competition from medical
    device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies. In Renal,
    global and regional competitors continue to expand their
    manufacturing capacity for PD products and their PD sales and
    marketing channels. Competition is primarily focused on
    cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and
    technological innovation. There has been increasing
    consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its
    competitors, which continues to result in pricing and market
    share pressures.

Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to
    exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world
    use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, such
    as price controls, product formularies (lists of recommended or
    approved products), and competitive tenders which require the
    submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of Baxter’s
    products are dependent, in part, on the availability of
    reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as
    well as insurance companies and other private payers. In the
    United States, the federal and many state governments have
    adopted or proposed initiatives relating to Medicaid and other
    health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates
    that Baxter and other providers are required to pay to the
    state. In addition to government regulation, managed care
    organizations in the United States, which include medical
    insurance companies, medical plan administrators,
    health-maintenance organizations, hospital and physician
    alliances and pharmacy benefit managers, continue to put
    pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products. Managed
    care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures, and
    their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their
    consolidation into fewer, larger organizations and a growing
    number of enrolled patients. Baxter faces similar issues outside
    of the United States. In Europe and Latin America, for example,
    the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and
    controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public
    tenders, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public
    tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain
    products.

Intellectual
    Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to
    Baxter’s business. Baxter relies on patents, trademarks,
    copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and confidentiality
    agreements to develop, maintain and strengthen its competitive
    position. Baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks
    throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements
    relating to various third-party patents and technologies.
    Products manufactured by Baxter are sold primarily under its own
    trademarks and trade names. Some products distributed by the
    company are sold under the company’s trade names, while
    others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers. Trade
    secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary
    information is also important to Baxter. The company maintains
    certain details about its processes, products and technology as
    trade secrets and generally requires employees, consultants,
    parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners
    to enter into confidentiality agreements.

Baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology
    through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis. This
    protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such
    protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company.
    Baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of
    its patents and trademarks and takes commercially reasonable
    steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world
    against potential infringers, including judicial or
    administrative action where appropriate.

Baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent
    litigation. At any given time, the company is involved as either
    a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and
    other intellectual property-related actions. Such litigation can
    result in significant royalty or other payments or result in
    injunctions that


can prevent the sale of products. For more information on patent
    and other litigation, see Note 11 in Item 8 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Research
    and Development

Baxter’s investment in research and development (R&D)
    is essential to its future growth and its ability to remain
    competitive in each of its business segments. Accordingly,
    Baxter continues to focus its investment in R&D programs to
    enhance future growth through clinical differentiation.
    Expenditures for Baxter’s R&D activities were
    $915 million in 2010, $917 million in 2009 and
    $868 million in 2008. These expenditures include costs
    associated with R&D activities performed at the
    company’s R&D centers located around the world, which
    include facilities in Austria, Belgium, Japan and the United
    States, as well as in-licensing, milestone and reimbursement
    payments made to partners for R&D work performed at
    non-Baxter locations.

Principal areas of strategic focus for R&D include
    recombinant and plasma-based therapeutics, vaccines, initiatives
    in regenerative medicine, kidney dialysis, formulation of small
    molecule drugs, enhanced packaging systems for medication
    delivery, and parenteral nutrition. The company’s research
    efforts emphasize self-manufactured product development, and
    portions of that research relate to multiple product categories.
    Baxter supplements its own R&D efforts by acquiring various
    technologies and entering into development and other
    collaboration agreements with third parties. For more
    information on the company’s R&D activities, refer to
    the discussion under the caption entitled “Research and
    Development” contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Quality
    Management

Baxter’s success depends upon the quality of its products.
    Quality management plays an essential role in determining and
    meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving the
    company’s products and services and maintaining the
    integrity of the data that supports the safety and efficacy of
    the company’s products. Baxter has a network of quality
    systems throughout the company’s business units and
    facilities that relate to the design, development,
    manufacturing, packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution
    and labeling of the company’s products. To assess and
    facilitate compliance with applicable requirements, the company
    regularly reviews its quality systems to determine their
    effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. Baxter also
    performs assessments of its suppliers of raw materials,
    components and finished goods. In addition, the company conducts
    quality management reviews designed to inform management of key
    issues that may affect the quality of products and services.

From time to time, the company may determine that products
    manufactured or marketed by the company do not meet company
    specifications, published standards, such as those issued by the
    International Organization for Standardization, or regulatory
    requirements. When a quality issue is identified, Baxter
    investigates the issue and takes appropriate corrective action,
    such as notice to the customer of revised labeling, correction
    of the product at the customer location, withdrawal of the
    product from the market and other actions. For more information
    on corrective actions taken by Baxter, refer to the discussion
    under the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory
    Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Government
    Regulation

The operations of Baxter and many of the products manufactured
    or sold by the company are subject to extensive regulation by
    numerous government agencies, both within and outside the United
    States. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable
    Care Act was enacted in the United States. While this
    legislation provides for a number of changes in how companies
    are compensated for providing healthcare products and services,
    many of these changes will be implemented by regulations which
    have yet to be established. For more information on the expected
    impact of healthcare reform on the company, refer to the
    information under the caption “The implementation of
    healthcare reform in the United States may adversely affect our
    business” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.


In the United States, the federal agencies that regulate the
    company’s facilities, operations, employees, products
    (their manufacture, sale, import and export) and services
    include: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the
    Drug Enforcement Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency,
    the Occupational Health & Safety Administration, the
    Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Justice, the
    Department of Labor, the Department of Defense, Customs and
    Border Protection, the Department of Commerce, the Department of
    Treasury and others. Because Baxter supplies products and
    services to healthcare providers that are reimbursed by
    federally funded programs such as Medicare, its activities are
    also subject to regulation by the Center for Medicare/Medicaid
    Services and enforcement by the Office of the Inspector General
    within the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG). State
    agencies in the United States also regulate the facilities,
    operations, employees, products and services of the company
    within their respective states. Outside the United States, the
    company’s products and operations are subject to extensive
    regulation by government agencies, including the European
    Medicines Agency (EMA) in the European Union. International
    government agencies also regulate public health, product
    registration, pricing, manufacturing, environmental conditions,
    labor, exports, imports and other aspects of the company’s
    global operations.

The FDA in the United States, the EMA in Europe, and other
    government agencies inside and outside of the United States,
    administer requirements covering the testing, safety,
    effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and
    advertising, distribution and post-market surveillance of
    Baxter’s products. The company must obtain specific
    approval from the FDA and

non-U.S. regulatory

authorities before it can market and sell most of its products
    in a particular country. Even after the company obtains
    regulatory approval to market a product, the product and the
    company’s manufacturing processes are subject to continued
    review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities worldwide.

The company is subject to possible administrative and legal
    actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies inside and
    outside the United States. Such actions may include warning
    letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions,
    injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products,
    civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant
    approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal
    of existing approvals and licenses. From time to time, the
    company takes steps to ensure safety and efficacy of its
    products, such as removing products from the market found not to
    meet applicable requirements and improving the effectiveness of
    quality systems. For more information on compliance actions
    taken by the company, refer to the discussion under the caption
    entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7
    of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Environmental policies of the company require compliance with
    all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate, among
    other things, appropriate capital expenditures for environmental
    protection.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, Baxter employed approximately
    48,000 people.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider
    the following risk factors. If any of the events described below
    occurs, our business, financial condition and results of
    operations and future growth prospects could suffer.

If we
    are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to
    keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be adversely
    affected.

The successful and timely implementation of our business model
    depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and
    introduce new products. As our competitors will continue to
    introduce competitive products, the development and acquisition
    of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy,
    safety, patients’ and clinicians’ ease of use and
    cost-effectiveness are important to our success. The success of
    new product offerings will depend on many factors, including our
    ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs,
    obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, develop and
    manufacture products in an economic and timely manner, obtain or
    maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual
    property, and differentiate our products from those of our
    competitors. Failure by us to introduce planned products or
    other new products or to introduce products on schedule could
    have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

The development and acquisition of innovative products and
    technologies that improve efficacy, safety, patients’ and
    clinicians’ ease of use and cost-effectiveness involve
    significant technical and business risks. If we cannot adapt to
    changing technologies or anticipate changes in our current and
    potential customers’ requirements our products may become
    obsolete, and our business could suffer. Our success will
    depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our
    existing products, develop new technology that addresses the
    increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective
    customers, license or acquire leading technologies and respond
    to technological advances and emerging industry standards and
    practices on a timely and cost-effective basis.

We are
    subject to a number of existing laws and regulations,
    non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations, and we are
    susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.

As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and
    products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous
    government agencies, both inside and outside the United States.
    The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are subject
    to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number
    of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by
    specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be
    capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies
    with those laws and regulations.

The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products
    are subject to extensive regulation and increasing scrutiny by
    the FDA and other regulatory authorities both inside and outside
    the United States. Any new product must undergo lengthy and
    rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming
    procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory
    authorities. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior
    to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time
    thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA
    or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection
    or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result
    in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary
    sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution
    of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a
    government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on
    operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any
    of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us
    and our products, which could adversely affect our sales.

We continue to address a number of regulatory issues as
    discussed further under the caption entitled “Certain
    Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that
    additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be
    incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to the
    company will not occur, that the company will not face civil
    claims for


damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional
    charges or significant asset impairments may not be required,
    that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or
    that additional regulation will not be introduced that may
    adversely affect the company’s operations and consolidated
    financial statements.

The sales and marketing of our products and our relationships
    with healthcare providers are under increasing scrutiny by
    federal, state and foreign government agencies. The FDA, the
    OIG, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal
    Trade Commission have each increased their enforcement efforts
    (including joint efforts) with respect to the Anti-Kickback
    Statute, False Claims Act, off-label promotion of products,
    other healthcare related laws, antitrust and other competition
    laws. The DOJ also has increased its focus on the enforcement of
    the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly
    as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies. The
    FCPA prohibits certain individuals and entities, including the
    company, from promising, offering, or giving anything of value
    to foreign officials with the intent of influencing the foreign
    official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain
    business or gain an improper advantage. Outside of the United
    States, our business involves significant interaction with
    foreign officials. The FCPA also imposes recordkeeping and
    internal controls requirements on the company. Foreign
    governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical
    companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships
    with healthcare providers. The laws and standards governing the
    promotion, sale and reimbursement of our products and those
    governing our relationships with healthcare providers and
    governments can be complicated, are subject to frequent change
    and may be violated unknowingly. We have compliance programs in
    place, including policies, training and various forms of
    monitoring, designed to address these risks. Nonetheless, these
    programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by
    our employees that violate these laws. Violations, or
    allegations of violations, of these laws may result in large
    civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in
    government programs, diversion of management time, attention and
    resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. Refer
    to Note 11 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a discussion of the requests that the company received in
    2010 from certain federal government agencies.

Issues
    with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our
    business, subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation
    and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our
    products.

Our success depends upon the quality of our products. Quality
    management plays an essential role in determining and meeting
    customer requirements, preventing defects, improving the
    company’s products and services and maintaining the
    integrity of the data that supports the safety and efficacy of
    our products. Our future operating results will depend on our
    ability to implement and improve our quality management program,
    and effectively train and manage our employee base with respect
    to quality management. While we have a network of quality
    systems throughout our business units and facilities that relate
    to the design, development, manufacturing, packaging,
    sterilization, handling, distribution and labeling of our
    products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to
    any of our products. In addition, some of the raw materials
    employed in our production processes are derived from human and
    animal origins. Though great care is taken to assure the safety
    of these raw materials, the nature of their origin elevates the
    potential for the introduction of pathogenic agents or other
    contaminants.

A quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations and may
    result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary
    sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of
    products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government
    to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or
    withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to
    address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely
    manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer
    confidence in us or our current or future products, which may
    result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully
    launching new products. In addition, we may be named as a
    defendant in product liability or other lawsuits, which could
    result in costly litigation, reduced sales, significant
    liabilities and diversion of our management’s time,
    attention and resources. We continue to be self-insured with
    respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party
    insurance coverage for such claims increases our potential
    exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Even
    claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and
    require us to incur significant legal fees.


For more information on regulatory matters currently being
    addressed by the company, refer to the discussion under the
    caption entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in
    Item 7 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Implementation
    of the FDA order to recall our COLLEAGUE infusion pumps in the
    United States may adversely affect our business.

Pursuant to the Consent Decree entered into by the company in
    June 2006, the FDA issued a final order in July 2010 regarding
    the recall of the company’s COLLEAGUE infusion pumps
    currently in use in the United States. The company is executing
    the recall over the two years following the final order by
    offering its customers an option to replace their COLLEAGUE
    infusion pumps or receive monetary consideration. Under the
    replacement option, the company’s customers may receive the
    Sigma International General Medical Apparatus, LLC (SIGMA)
    Spectrum infusion pumps in exchange for their COLLEAGUE infusion
    pumps. For more information on the COLLEAGUE recall, refer to
    the discussion under the caption entitled “Certain
    Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The company cannot be certain that SIGMA will have sufficient
    production capacity to meet the demand for SIGMA Spectrum
    infusion pumps. Customers choosing a refund or for whom
    sufficient replacement pumps are unavailable are likely to move
    to a competitive infusion pump platform. Many of the
    company’s COLLEAGUE customers also purchase a variety of
    the company’s other Medication Delivery products. If a
    significant number of COLLEAGUE customers move to a competitive
    pump platform, our business may suffer and sales of other
    products in the company’s Medication Delivery product
    portfolio may be adversely affected. In addition, it is possible
    that substantial additional cash and non-cash charges, including
    significant asset impairments related to the COLLEAGUE infusion
    pumps and related businesses, may be required in future periods
    based on new information, changes in estimates, the
    implementation of the recall in the United States, and other
    actions the company may be required to undertake in markets
    outside the United States.

The
    implementation of healthcare reform in the United States may
    adversely affect our business.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Act), which was
    signed into law in March 2010, includes several provisions which
    impact the company’s businesses in the United States,
    including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the
    340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified
    entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations,
    with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and
    an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices.
    The company will also be required to pay a tax on the sales of
    its pharmaceutical products to the government beginning in 2011
    and a 2.3% tax on certain of its medical devices beginning in
    2013. The impact of the increased Medicaid rebates and the
    expanded 340B Drug Pricing Program is largely expected to impact
    the company’s Bioscience business, while the additional
    taxes are expected to impact each of the company’s business
    segments. We may also experience downward pricing pressure as
    the Act reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals.
    While it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and
    increase access to medical care generally, additional
    regulations need to be established to implement many of the
    Act’s provisions. As a result, the full impact of the Act
    is uncertain.

If
    reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or
    modified, our business could suffer.

Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which
    the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance,
    managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management
    organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration
    authorities, private health coverage insurers and other
    third-party payors. These healthcare management organizations
    and third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices
    charged for medical products and services. Additionally, as
    discussed above, the containment of healthcare costs has become
    a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of
    drugs and other healthcare products have been targeted in this
    effort. We also face challenges, including austerity measures
    being taken by governments, in certain foreign markets where the
    pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject
    to government controls. Government controls in foreign markets
    also impact our ability to collect accounts receivable in a
    timely manner. Accordingly, our current and potential products
    may not be considered cost effective, and reimbursement to the
    consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us to


sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and
    regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change
    at any time and in ways that are difficult to predict and these
    changes may be adverse to us. Further reductions in Medicare,
    Medicaid or other third-party payor reimbursements could have a
    negative effect on our operating results.

Consolidation
    in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

There has been consolidation in our customer base, and by our
    competitors, which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures.
    As these consolidations occur, competition to provide products
    like ours will become more intense, and the importance of
    establishing relationships with key industry participants
    including GPOs, IDNs and other customers will become greater.
    Customers will continue to work and organize to negotiate price
    reductions for our products and services. To the extent we are
    forced to reduce our prices, our business will become less
    profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding
    reductions in costs. The company’s sales could be adversely
    affected if any of its contracts with its GPOs, IDNs or other
    customers are terminated in part or in their entirety, or
    members decide to purchase from another supplier.

We
    face substantial competition and many of our competitors have
    significantly greater financial and other
    resources.

Although no single company competes with us in all of our
    businesses, we face substantial competition in each of our
    segments from international and domestic healthcare and
    pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily
    focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product
    performance, and technological innovation. Some competitors,
    principally large pharmaceutical companies, have greater
    financial, R&D and marketing resources than us. Competition
    may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our
    markets or modify their existing products to compete directly
    with ours. Greater financial, R&D and marketing resources
    may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or
    emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that
    may render our products obsolete or non-competitive. If our
    competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or
    achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization
    than we do, our operations will likely be negatively affected.

We also face competition for marketing, distribution and
    collaborative development agreements, for establishing
    relationships with academic and research institutions, and for
    licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic
    institutions, government agencies and other public and private
    research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent
    protection and establish collaborative arrangements for
    discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of
    products similar to ours. These companies and institutions
    compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific
    and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies
    complementary to our programs. If we are unable to successfully
    compete with these companies and institutions, our business may
    suffer.

The
    nature of producing plasma-based products may prevent us from
    timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our
    production capacity.

The production of plasma-based products is a lengthy and complex
    process. Efforts to increase the collection of plasma may
    include the construction and regulatory approval of additional
    plasma collection facilities, which can be a lengthy regulatory
    and capital intensive process. As a result, our ability to match
    our collection and production of plasma-based products to market
    demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet the
    market demand of our plasma-based products or potentially an
    oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand for our
    plasma-based products may result in customers transitioning to
    available competitive products resulting in a loss of segment
    share. In the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower
    the prices we charge for some of our plasma-based products,
    close collection and processing facilities, record asset
    impairment charges or take other action which may adversely
    affect our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.


If we
    are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a
    timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing
    difficulties, our business may be adversely
    affected.

The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of
    sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We
    manufacture our products in over 50 manufacturing facilities
    around the world. We acquire our components and materials from
    many suppliers in various countries. While efforts are made to
    diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain
    instances we acquire components and materials from a sole
    supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the
    continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will
    continue to be successful. In addition, due to the regulatory
    environment in which we operate, we may be unable to quickly
    establish additional or replacement sources for some components
    or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an
    inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could
    adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a
    timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product
    sales.

Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due
    to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals,
    including biologics, and devices as well as the strict
    regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations.
    Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production
    failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage,
    unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation.
    A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior
    to the release of products to our customers may also result in
    warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary
    sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of
    products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government
    to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or
    withdrawal of existing approvals or licenses.

Some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas that
    are subject to hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural
    disasters. Loss or damage to a manufacturing facility could
    adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient
    quantities of key products to meet customer demand or
    contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue
    and other adverse business consequences. Because of the time
    required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third
    party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to
    replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing
    capacity due to natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise.

If we
    are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights,
    or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of
    others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be
    materially damaged.

Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our
    business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our
    ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent
    rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We
    cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in
    issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be
    challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will
    not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property
    rights of others will not prevent the company from selling
    certain products or including key features in the company’s
    products.

The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain
    and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant
    litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our
    industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and
    validity of our patents on products or processes as well as
    allegations that our products infringe patents held by
    competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types
    of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the
    ability to market products, which could lead to a significant
    loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of
    operations.

We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and
    know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive
    positions. While we protect our proprietary rights to the extent
    possible, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know,
    discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary
    information or techniques, or that they will not gain access to
    our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.
    Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect
    unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets.
    Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property
    would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may
    cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.


If our
    business development activities are unsuccessful, our business
    could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely
    affected.

As part of our long-term growth strategy, we are engaged in
    business development activities including evaluating
    acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology
    licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities
    may result in substantial investment of the company’s
    resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new
    markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors,
    including our ability to find suitable opportunities for
    acquisition, investment or alliance; whether we are able to
    complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that
    are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other company’s
    underlying technology, products and ability to execute its
    business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation
    related to these products or technology; and our ability to
    successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product,
    technology or research into our existing operations, including
    the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and
    development projects. If we are unsuccessful in our business
    development activities, we may be unable to meet our financial
    targets and our financial performance could be adversely
    affected.

If we
    are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities or exiting
    low margin businesses or discontinuing low profit products, our
    business, financial condition and results could be adversely
    affected.

Successful execution of our business strategy depends, in part,
    on improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our
    current and future products. A failure to identify and take
    advantage of opportunities that allow us to increase our profit
    margins or a failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses
    or discontinue low profit margin products, may result in us
    failing to meet our financial targets and may otherwise have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

We are
    subject to risks associated with doing business
    globally.

Our operations, both inside and outside the United States, are
    subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and
    under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions
    and geographies. These risks include fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates, changes in exchange controls, loss of business
    in government and public tenders that are held annually in many
    cases, nationalization, increasingly complex labor environments,
    expropriation and other governmental actions, availability of
    raw materials, changes in taxation, including legislative
    changes in United States and international taxation of income
    earned outside of the United States, importation limitations,
    export control restrictions, changes in or violations of
    U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA, dependence on a few
    government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic
    and political instability, disputes between countries,
    diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property,
    disruption or destruction of operations in a significant
    geographic region — due to the location of
    manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or
    customers — regardless of cause, including war,
    terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, or natural
    or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire,
    earthquake, storm or disease. Failure to comply with the laws
    and regulations that affect our global operations could have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
    of operations.

We are
    subject to foreign currency exchange risk.

In 2010, we generated approximately 60% of our revenue outside
    the United States. We anticipate that revenue from outside the
    United States will continue to be significant. As a result, our
    financial results may continue to be adversely affected by
    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Market
    volatility and currency fluctuations may also reduce the
    benefits from our natural hedges and limit our ability to
    cost-effectively hedge against our foreign currency exposure.
    Governments may impose currency restrictions restricting our
    ability to manage our foreign currency exposure. We cannot
    predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks. A
    discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate
    fluctuations, and the ways and extent to which we attempt to
    mitigate such impact, including the impact of restrictions on
    currency exchange imposed by the Venezuelan government, is
    contained under the heading “Financial Instrument Market
    Risk” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.


We may
    experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise
    resource planning system.

We are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new global
    enterprise resource planning system (ERP). The ERP is designed
    to accurately maintain the company’s books and records and
    provide information to the company’s management team
    important to the operation of the business. The company’s
    ERP has required, and will continue to require, the investment
    of significant human and financial resources. We may not be able
    to successfully implement the ERP without experiencing delays,
    increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant
    disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the
    ERP could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship
    product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual
    obligations or otherwise operate our business.

We are
    subject to a number of pending lawsuits.

We are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits, including
    with respect to patent and product liability matters, and could
    be subject to additional lawsuits in the future. See
    Note 11 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for more information regarding these lawsuits. Given the
    uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all
    cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result
    from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a
    party. In view of these uncertainties, we cannot assure that the
    outcome of these matters will not result in charges in excess of
    any established reserves, and, to the extent available,
    liability insurance. Protracted litigation, including any
    adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on the business,
    operations or financial condition of the company.

Current
    or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our
    business and financial condition.

The company’s ability to generate cash flows from
    operations could be affected if there is a material decline in
    the demand for the company’s products, in the solvency of
    its customers or suppliers, or deterioration in the
    company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current
    or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our
    business and the business of our customers, including their
    ability to pay for our products and services, and the amount
    spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease
    in the demand for our products and services, declining cash
    flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies
    and increased price competition. These conditions may also
    adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a
    disruption in our ability to produce our products.

    Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom
    and Venezuela.

The company continually evaluates its plants and production
    lines and believes that its current facilities plus any planned
    expansions are generally sufficient to meet its expected needs
    and expected near-term growth. Expansion projects and facility
    closings will be undertaken as necessary in response to market
    needs.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the
    consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

EXECUTIVE
    OVERVIEW

Description
    of the Company and Business Segments

Baxter International Inc. (Baxter or the company), through its
    subsidiaries, develops, manufactures and markets products that
    save and sustain the lives of people with hemophilia, immune
    disorders, infectious diseases, kidney disease, trauma, and
    other chronic and acute medical conditions. As a global,
    diversified healthcare company, Baxter applies a unique
    combination of expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and
    biotechnology to create products that advance patient care
    worldwide. The company operates in three segments.

BioScience

processes recombinant and plasma-based proteins to treat
    hemophilia and other bleeding disorders; plasma-based therapies
    to treat immune deficiencies, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency,
    burns and shock, and other chronic and acute blood-related
    conditions; products for regenerative medicine, such as
    biosurgery products; and select vaccines.

Medication Delivery

manufactures intravenous (IV) solutions and
    administration sets, premixed drugs and drug-reconstitution
    systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for injectable drugs, IV
    nutrition products, infusion pumps, and inhalation anesthetics,
    as well as provides products and services related to pharmacy
    compounding, drug formulation and packaging technologies. In
    October 2010, the company entered into an agreement to divest
    its U.S. generic injectables business. Refer to Note 3
    for further information regarding this divestiture.

Renal

provides products to treat end-stage renal disease, or
    irreversible kidney failure. The business manufactures solutions
    and other products for peritoneal dialysis (PD), a home-based
    therapy, and also distributes products for hemodialysis (HD),
    which is generally conducted in a hospital or clinic. In October
    2010, the company announced the formation of a new Medical
    Products business, combining the company’s Medication
    Delivery and Renal businesses into a single global business unit.

Baxter has approximately 48,000 employees and conducts
    business in over 100 countries. The company generates
    approximately 60% of its revenues outside the United States, and
    maintains over 50 manufacturing facilities and over 100
    distribution facilities in the United States, Europe,
    Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada.

Financial
    Results

Baxter faced a number of significant challenges in 2010,
    including the impact of the global economic environment,
    healthcare reform in the United States and abroad, and dynamics
    in the plasma proteins market. While these challenges negatively
    impacted the company’s sales growth and profitability,
    Baxter delivered solid financial results and executed on key
    commercial, operational and organizational strategies in 2010.

Baxter’s global net sales totaled $12.8 billion in
    2010, an increase of 2% over 2009, including a favorable foreign
    currency impact of 1 percentage point. International sales
    totaled $7.6 billion, an increase of 5% over 2009,
    including a favorable foreign currency impact of
    2 percentage points.

Baxter’s net income for 2010 totaled $1.4 billion, or
    $2.39 per diluted share, compared to $2.2 billion, or $3.59
    per diluted share, in the prior year. Net income in 2010
    included after-tax asset impairment, business optimization,
    litigation-related, in-process research and development
    (IPR&D) and other charges which reduced net sales by
    $213 million and net income by $946 million, or $1.59
    per diluted share. Net income in 2009 included after-tax
    impairment, business optimization and other charges which
    reduced net income by $125 million, or $0.21 per diluted
    share. On an adjusted basis, excluding these special charges in
    both years, Baxter’s net income in 2010 was
    $2.4 billion, which represents an increase of 2% from
    $2.3 billion in 2009, while earnings per diluted share of
    $3.98 increased 5% from $3.80 in 2009. Adjusted net income and
    adjusted earnings per share, each excluding special items, are
    non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial
    measures. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures may
    provide a more complete understanding of the company’s
    operations and may facilitate a fuller analysis of the
    company’s results of operations, particularly in evaluating
    performance from one period to another.


Significant items impacting the company’s results in 2010
    included a $588 million pre-tax charge associated with the
    recall of the company’s COLLEAGUE infusion pumps from the
    U.S. market and other actions the company is undertaking
    outside of the United States, with $213 million recorded as
    a reduction of net sales and $375 million in cost of sales.
    This charge primarily reflected the costs associated with the
    execution of the final order issued in July 2010 by the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which allows
    Baxter to offer replacement infusion pumps or monetary
    consideration to owners of COLLEAGUE pumps. Under the
    replacement option, customers may receive Spectrum infusion
    pumps manufactured by Sigma International General Medical
    Apparatus, LLC (SIGMA), a company in which Baxter has an equity
    stake. Net income in 2009 also included a $27 million
    pre-tax charge primarily related to planned retirement costs
    associated with the SYNDEO PCA Syringe Pump.

Also impacting the company’s results were costs associated
    with the company’s execution of certain strategies to
    optimize its business portfolio and organizational structure,
    including the following.

•

The company entered into a definitive agreement to divest its
    U.S. generic injectables business. The determination to
    divest this business was based on the company’s strategic
    decision to redirect resources toward its proprietary, enhanced
    packaging offerings and formulation technologies, consistent
    with the company’s focus on product differentiation. As a
    result of the divestiture agreement, the company recorded a
    pre-tax impairment charge of $112 million in 2010.

•

The company took actions to optimize its overall cost structure
    on a global basis, including streamlining its international
    operations, rationalizing its manufacturing facilities and
    enhancing its general and administrative infrastructure. The
    company recorded a pre-tax charge of $257 million in 2010
    related to these actions. The company also recorded a business
    optimization charge of $79 million in 2009.

The company also recorded pre-tax charges in 2010 of
    $62 million related to litigation, $34 million related
    to IPR&D, $28 million to write down accounts
    receivable in Greece, and $39 million to write off a
    deferred tax asset as a result of a change in the tax treatment
    of reimbursements under the Medicare Part D retiree
    prescription drug subsidy program. In 2009, the company recorded
    a pre-tax impairment charge of $54 million associated with
    the discontinuation of the company’s SOLOMIX drug delivery
    system in development.

Baxter’s financial results included research and
    development (R&D) expenses totaling $915 million in
    2010. This significant investment in R&D reflects the
    company’s efforts to enhance future growth through clinical
    differentiation, including the broadening of its hemophilia
    portfolio with continued innovation; exploration of alternative
    routes of administration of GAMMAGARD LIQUID (marketed as KIOVIG
    in most markets outside the United States), the liquid
    formulation of the company’s antibody replacement therapy,
    IGIV (immune globulin intravenous); and the development of home
    HD therapy. During the year, the company advanced a number of
    Phase III clinical trials and numerous earlier stage
    clinical trials of therapies that have the potential to impact
    the treatment and delivery of care for chronic diseases like
    Alzheimer’s disease, hemophilia, end-stage renal disease
    and immune deficiencies.

The company’s financial position remains strong, with cash
    flows from operations totaling $3.0 billion in 2010, a
    record level for the company, driven by strong working capital
    management. The company has continued to execute on its
    disciplined capital allocation framework, which was designed to
    optimize shareholder value creation through targeted investments
    in working capital and capital investments, share repurchases
    and dividends, and acquisitions and other business development
    initiatives to accelerate the company’s growth.

Capital investments totaled $963 million in 2010 as the
    company continues to invest in capacity across its businesses to
    support future growth. In addition, these investments were
    focused on projects that enhance the company’s cost
    structure and manufacturing capabilities, particularly as they
    relate to the company’s nutritional, anesthesia and PD
    products, as well as plasma and recombinant manufacturing
    platforms. A significant portion of the company’s
    investment in capital expenditures supports the company’s
    strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in
    growing markets. In addition, the company continues to invest to
    support the company’s ongoing strategic focus on R&D
    with the expansion of research facilities, manufacturing sites
    and laboratories.


The company also continued to return value to its shareholders
    in the form of share repurchases and dividends. During 2010, the
    company repurchased 30 million shares of common stock for
    $1.5 billion, and paid cash dividends to its shareholders
    totaling $688 million. Since 2007, the company has
    consistently raised the quarterly dividend rate, with increases
    of 20% in 2008, 12% in 2009 and 7% in 2010.

The company’s strong financial position also enabled
    several business development initiatives in 2010, including the
    following:

•

The acquisition of ApaTech Limited (ApaTech), a U.K.-based
    orthobiologics company and leader in the research and
    development of bone graft technologies, which includes ACTIFUSE,
    a synthetic bone graft material enabling the company’s
    entry in the bone fusion market;

•

The completion of an agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical
    Company Limited to jointly pursue development and licensure of
    an H5N1 influenza vaccine in Japan;

•

The acquisition and licensing of the hemophilia-related
    intellectual property and other assets of Archemix Corp.
    (Archemix), including the lead product within the agreement,
    ARC19499, a synthetic subcutaneously-administered hemophilia
    therapy currently in a Phase I trial in the United
    Kingdom; and

•

The acquisition of exclusive distribution and licensing rights
    in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada to
    GLASSIA [Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor (Human)], the first

ready-to-use

liquid alpha1-proteinase inhibitor used to treat alpha-1
    antitrypsin deficiency, as a result of an agreement with Kamada
    Ltd. (Kamada).

Strategic
    Objectives

Baxter is focusing on several key objectives to successfully
    execute its long-term strategy to achieve sustainable growth and
    deliver shareholder value. Baxter’s diversified healthcare
    model, its broad portfolio of products that treat
    life-threatening acute or chronic conditions, and its global
    presence are core components of the company’s strategy to
    achieve these objectives. R&D innovation and scientific
    productivity will continue to be a key strategic priority. In
    2011, the company will continue to invest in its R&D
    pipeline while enhancing the prioritization and management of
    R&D projects, ensuring that R&D expenditures match
    business growth strategies and leveraging the company’s
    core strengths to expand into new therapeutic areas.

In 2011, Baxter launched a global, multi-year business
    transformation initiative, with the goal of strengthening the
    company’s focus on disciplined innovation, commercial
    effectiveness, operational excellence, organizational
    effectiveness and accelerated growth. As part of this
    initiative, the company will seek opportunities to maximize its
    deployment of sales and marketing resources, and re-engineer
    certain global systems and processes, including quality,
    regulatory and financial systems, as the company reinvigorates
    its commitment to continuous improvement. The company also plans
    to pursue accelerated growth by fully capitalizing on
    Baxter’s diversified healthcare model in its business
    development opportunities, including acquisitions,
    collaborations and alliances. Through continued innovation,
    investment and collaboration, Baxter seeks to advance new
    therapies, improve the safety and cost-effectiveness of
    treatments and expand access to care.

The company’s ability to sustain long-term growth and
    successfully execute the strategies discussed above depends in
    part on the company’s ability to manage within an
    increasingly competitive and regulated environment and to
    address the other risk factors described in Item 1A of this
    Annual Report on

Foreign currency favorably impacted net sales by
    1 percentage point in 2010, as the impact of the
    strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro was
    more than offset by the weakening of the U.S. Dollar
    relative to other currencies, including the Australian Dollar,
    the Canadian Dollar and the Japanese Yen. Foreign currency
    unfavorably impacted net sales by 5 percentage points in
    2009 due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative
    to other currencies, including the Euro and the British Pound.

Total net sales growth in 2010 was unfavorably impacted by
    2 percentage points due to the COLLEAGUE infusion pump
    charge, which reduced net sales in the Medication Delivery
    segment by $213 million. Refer to Note 5 for further
    information regarding this charge. In addition, healthcare
    reform unfavorably impacted sales growth in 2010 by
    approximately 0.5 percentage points. Healthcare reform
    legislation enacted in the United States in the first quarter of
    2010 increased Medicaid rebates and expanded the 340B Drug
    Pricing Program, primarily impacting the Recombinants, Plasma
    Proteins and Antibody Therapy product categories in the
    BioScience segment. Similar reform actions undertaken by
    governments outside the United States also unfavorably impacted
    sales growth.

Net sales in the BioScience segment increased 1% and 5% in 2010
    and 2009, respectively (with no impact from foreign currency in
    2010 and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of
    5 percentage points in 2009). Sales growth in the
    BioScience segment in both years was driven by increased demand
    across a majority of the product categories. The principal
    drivers were the following:

•

Sales growth in the Recombinants product category in both 2010
    and 2009 was the result of the continued adoption of the
    company’s advanced recombinant therapy, ADVATE
    [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free
    Method]. In 2010, this growth was partially offset by lower
    tender sales in the United Kingdom and a reduction in
    distributor inventory levels in the United States.


•

In the Plasma Proteins product category, sales growth in both
    years was driven by strong international demand for FEIBA (an
    anti-inhibitor coagulant complex) and continued market
    penetration in the United States of ARALAST NP [Alpha
    1-Proteinase Inhibitor (Human)]. Partially offsetting this
    growth in 2010 were a reduction in international sales of
    plasma-derived factor VIII and lower U.S. sales of albumin.
    In 2009, strong demand for plasma-derived factor VIII and
    improved pricing and increased demand for albumin contributed to
    sales growth.

•

In the Antibody Therapy product line, strong sales growth in
    2009 was driven by improved pricing and increased demand for
    GAMMAGARD LIQUID therapy. In 2010, sales in this product line
    were unfavorably impacted by market share loss versus the prior
    year and pricing actions the company took during the year,
    offset by increased sales due to a competitor being out of the
    market in the fourth quarter. Sales were also unfavorably
    impacted by the termination of a distribution agreement for
    WinRho

®

SDF [Rho(D) Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] effective
    July 1, 2010 and healthcare reform.

•

In the Regenerative Medicine product category, sales growth in
    2010 was driven by sales of ACTIFUSE as a result of the
    company’s first quarter acquisition of ApaTech. Also
    significantly contributing to the sales growth in this product
    category in both years was increased demand for the
    company’s fibrin sealant product, FLOSEAL. Refer to
    Note 4 for additional information regarding the ApaTech
    acquisition.

•

The sales decline in the Other product category in both years
    was primarily due to lower international sales of FSME-IMMUN (a
    tick-borne encephalitis vaccine) and NEISVAC-C (for the
    prevention of meningitis C).

Net sales in the Medication Delivery segment increased 3% and 2%
    in 2010 and 2009, respectively (with a favorable foreign
    currency impact of 2 percentage points in 2010 and an
    unfavorable foreign currency impact of 5 percentage points
    in 2009). The principal drivers were the following:

•

In the IV Therapies product line, sales growth in 2010 was
    driven by improved pricing and increased demand for IV
    solutions and nutritional products. Contributing to growth were
    market share gains in the United States, partially as a result
    of competitor supply issues. In 2009, the unfavorable impact of
    foreign currency more than offset organic sales growth due to
    increased demand, particularly in international markets, and
    improved pricing in the United States.

•

In 2010, sales growth in the Global Injectables product line was
    driven by strong sales of certain enhanced packaging products.
    Also contributing to sales growth in both years were sales of
    select multi-source generic products, as well as growth in the
    company’s international pharmacy compounding and
    U.S. pharmaceutical partnering businesses. In October 2010,
    the company entered into an agreement to divest its
    U.S. generic injectables business. Refer to Note 3 for
    further information regarding this divestiture.

•

The sales decline in the Infusion Systems product line in 2010
    was principally due to the $213 million charge against
    sales related to the recall of the COLLEAGUE infusion pump. Also
    contributing to the sales decline in both years were lower sales
    of disposable tubing sets used in the administration of IV


solutions and COLLEAGUE infusion pumps, partially offset by
    increased sales of SIGMA Spectrum infusion pumps. Refer to
    Note 5 for further information on the COLLEAGUE infusion
    pump charge.

•

Growth in both 2010 and 2009 in the Anesthesia product line was
    driven by increased sales of sevoflurane and SUPRANE
    (desflurane). The company continues to benefit from its position
    as the only global supplier of all three modern inhaled
    anesthetics (SUPRANE, sevoflurane and isoflurane).

Net sales in the Renal segment increased 5% in 2010 and
    decreased 2% in 2009 (with a favorable foreign currency impact
    of 3 percentage points in 2010 and an unfavorable foreign
    currency impact of 6 percentage points in 2009). The
    principal drivers were the following:

•

Net sales in the PD Therapy product line grew in 2010 as the
    result of gains in the number of PD patients in the United
    States, Latin America and Asia, with particularly strong patient
    growth in China. Penetration of PD Therapy products continues to
    be strong in emerging markets where many people with end-stage
    renal disease have historically been under-treated. In 2009,
    sales growth from PD patient gains was more than offset by the
    unfavorable impact of foreign currency.

•

In the HD Therapy product line, sales growth in 2010 was driven
    by international sales related to the company’s 2009
    acquisition of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, also known as
    Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (Edwards CRRT). In 2009,
    sales growth related to the Edwards CRRT acquisition was more
    than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and
    lower saline sales. Refer to Note 4 for additional
    information regarding the acquisition of Edwards CRRT.

Transition Services to Fenwal Inc.

Net sales
    in this category represent revenues associated with
    manufacturing, distribution and other services provided by the
    company to Fenwal Inc. (Fenwal) subsequent to the divestiture of
    the Transfusion Therapies (TT) business in February 2007.
    Revenues declined in 2010 and 2009 as Baxter provided less
    transition services to Fenwal. See Note 3 for additional
    information regarding the TT business divestiture.

Gross
    Margin

Gross margin declined in 2010 and increased in 2009. Included in
    the company’s gross margin percentages were the unfavorable
    impact of infusion pump charges and costs totaling
    $588 million (of which $375 million was recorded to
    cost of sales), $27 million and $125 million in 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, and the 2010 and 2009 business
    optimization charges, of which $132 million and
    $30 million were recorded in cost of sales in 2010 and
    2009, respectively. These charges unfavorably impacted the gross
    margin by 4.7, 0.5 and 1.1 percentage points in 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional
    information on these charges and costs.

Also unfavorably impacting the gross margin percentage in 2010
    were lower prices for certain plasma protein (including Antibody
    Therapy) products, cost inefficiencies driven by lower volume
    throughput for plasma-based therapies and vaccines, lower sales
    of high margin vaccines, increased inventory reserves and
    healthcare


reform in the United States and abroad. These items were
    partially offset by improved sales mix across other product
    lines, as well as a benefit from foreign currency.

The increase in gross margin in 2009 was principally driven by
    improvements in sales mix across all three segments,
    manufacturing cost and yield improvements, as well as improved
    pricing for select products. Contributing to the gross margin
    improvement was the continued customer conversion to ADVATE
    therapy; increased demand and improved pricing for GAMMAGARD
    LIQUID therapy and certain other plasma protein and nutritional
    products; and increased demand for IV solutions, global
    injectables and anesthesia products. Partially offsetting the
    gross margin improvement was the unfavorable impact of lower
    FSME-IMMUN vaccine revenues.

Marketing
    and Administrative Expenses

The marketing and administrative expense ratio increased in 2010
    and declined in 2009. The increase in the marketing and
    administrative expense ratio in 2010 was driven by the
    $588 million COLLEAGUE infusion pump charge (of which
    $213 million was recorded to sales), the $257 million
    business optimization charge (of which $125 million was
    recorded in marketing and administrative expenses), and a
    $28 million charge to write down accounts receivable in
    Greece. These charges unfavorably impacted the marketing and
    administrative expense ratio by 1.5 percentage points in
    2010.

The ratio in both years was favorably impacted by leverage from
    higher sales and the company’s continued focus on
    controlling discretionary spending, partially offset by
    increased spending relating to certain sales and promotional
    programs. Also impacting the marketing and administrative
    expense ratio in 2009 was the unfavorable impact of foreign
    currency and the $79 million business optimization charge (of
    which $49 million was recorded in marketing and
    administrative expenses), which increased the marketing and
    administrative expense ratio by 0.3 percentage points in
    2009.

Refer to Note 1 for further information regarding the
    Greece receivable charge and Note 5 for further information
    about the COLLEAGUE infusion pump charge and the 2010 and 2009
    business optimization charges.

Pension
    Plan Costs

Fluctuations in pension plan costs impacted the company’s
    gross margin and expense ratios. Pension plan costs increased
    $15 million in 2010 and $18 million in 2009, as
    detailed in Note 9. The $15 million increase in 2010
    was principally due to lower interest rates used to discount the
    plans’ projected benefit obligations and an increase in
    loss amortization, partially offset by the impact of
    $350 million of cash contributions made to the pension plan
    in the United States in 2010. The $18 million increase in
    2009 was principally due to an increase in loss amortization
    related to asset performance and demographic experience,
    partially offset by the impact of the company’s
    contributions to its pension plans and higher interest rates
    used to discount the plans’ projected benefit obligations
    as compared to the prior year.

Costs of the company’s pension plans are expected to
    increase from $170 million in 2010 to approximately
    $220 million in 2011, principally due to lower interest
    rates used to discount the plans’ projected benefit
    obligations, a decrease in the expected return on plan assets
    assumption, and an increase in loss amortization, partially
    offset by the impact of $150 million of discretionary cash
    contributions made to the pension plan in the United States in
    January 2011. Refer to Note 9 for further information on
    the funding of pension plans. For the domestic plans, the
    discount rate will decrease to 5.45% from 6.05% and the expected
    return on plan assets will decrease to 8.25% from 8.5% for 2011.

R&D expenses decreased slightly in 2010 and increased in
    2009. The reduction in R&D expenses in 2010 was due to the
    completion of clinical work on late-stage programs, lower
    milestone payments to partners and efforts to reposition
    projects to gain organizational efficiencies. The company
    continues to invest in all key R&D programs across the
    product pipeline. The increase in 2009 reflected the
    company’s continued focus on innovation and investments
    across its business portfolio to advance and expand its product
    pipeline. Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact on R&D
    expense growth in 2010 and a favorable impact in 2009.

R&D expenses in 2010 included IPR&D charges totaling
    $34 million, principally related to the licensing and
    acquisition of the hemophilia-related intellectual property and
    other assets of Archemix. Refer to Note 4 for more
    information regarding this transaction. R&D expenses in
    2008 included IPR&D charges totaling $19 million,
    principally related to an in-licensing agreement with Innocoll
    Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Innocoll).

The company’s investments in R&D reflect its efforts
    to enhance future growth through clinical differentiation,
    including broadening the hemophilia portfolio with continued
    innovation, exploring alternative routes of administration of
    GAMMAGARD LIQUID, and developing a home hemodialysis system. Key
    developments in 2010 included the following R&D milestones,
    product approvals and product launches:

•

FDA approval of
    TachoSil

®

(Absorbable Fibrin Sealant Patch) for use as an adjunct to
    hemostasis in cardiovascular surgery, the only adjunctive
    hemostatic agent available in the United States that combines a
    collagen patch with a coating of human coagulation factors;

•

Expansion of the launch of OLIMEL, the triple-chamber container
    system for parenteral nutrition, throughout Europe, and the
    launch of ADVATE in Brazil;

•

Approval in Austria and the Czech Republic for PREFLUCEL, the
    vaccine which uses the company’s Vero cell culture platform
    and was shown to be effective in preventing seasonal influenza
    and indicated for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and the
    elderly;

•

FDA approval of the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)
    application for a home hemodialysis system, developed through
    collaboration between DEKA Research and Development Corp., HHD
    LLC and DEKA Products Limited Partnership (collectively, DEKA)
    and the company, allowing the company to initiate a clinical
    study in patients undergoing hemodialysis therapy;

•

Receipt of promising results of an eighteen-month Phase II
    trial of GAMMAGARD LIQUID and GAMMAGARD S/D (Immune Globulin
    Intravenous) in treating

mild-to-moderate

Alzheimer’s disease;

•

Completion of a Phase III clinical trial of GAMMAGARD
    LIQUID with ENHANZE (HyQ), providing antibody replacement with
    an immune globulin therapy combined with recombinant human
    hyaluronidase to increase the subcutaneous spreading and
    absorption of immune globulin for patients with primary immune
    deficiency;

•

Completion of Phase II trials of CD34, a product that
    demonstrated significant benefit in pain reduction and exercise
    capacity in patients with Chronic Myocardial Ischemia, a
    narrowing of the coronary arteries as a result of
    atherosclerosis; the Phase II trials also indicated a
    significant reduction in amputation rates for patients with
    Critical Limb Ischemia, a severe arterial obstruction of blood
    flow to the extremities;

•

Completion of a Phase III trial evaluating TISSEEL (Fibrin
    Sealant) as a hemostatic agent in vascular surgery, and filing
    for regulatory approval for ARTISS [(Fibrin Sealant (Human)] for
    use in facial surgery in the United States; and

•

Receipt of interim data from a Phase I clinical study of
    recombinant von Willebrand factor indicating it may be safe and
    well tolerated in patients with type 3 and severe type 1 von
    Willebrand disease.

Net
    Interest Expense

Net interest expense decreased $11 million in 2010,
    principally due to an increase in interest income. Net interest
    expense increased $22 million in 2009, principally due to
    the impact of lower interest rates on interest income. Also
    contributing to the increase in net interest expense in 2009 was
    the impact of a higher average net debt balance due to the
    February 2009 issuance of $350 million of senior unsecured
    notes due in 2014 and


the August 2009 issuance of $500 million of senior
    unsecured notes due in 2019. Refer to Note 2 for a summary
    of the components of net interest expense for the three years
    ended December 31, 2010.

Other
    Expense, Net

Other expense, net was $159 million in 2010,
    $45 million in 2009 and $26 million in 2008. Refer to
    Note 2 for a table that details the components of other
    expense, net for the three years ended December 31, 2010.
    Other expense, net in each year included amounts relating to
    equity method investments and foreign currency fluctuations,
    principally relating to intercompany receivables, payables and
    loans denominated in a foreign currency.

Included in other expense, net in 2010 was an impairment charge
    of $112 million associated with the company’s
    agreement to divest its U.S. generic injectables business and a
    charge of $62 million associated with litigation related to
    the company’s 2008 recall of its heparin sodium injection
    products in the United States. In 2009, other expense, net
    included a charge of $54 million associated with the
    discontinuation of the company’s SOLOMIX drug delivery
    system in development. In 2008, other expense, net included a
    charge of $31 million associated with the discontinuation
    of the company’s CLEARSHOT pre-filled syringe program.
    Refer to Note 2 for further information on the
    litigation-related, SOLOMIX and CLEARSHOT charges.

Pre-Tax
    Income

Refer to Note 12 for a summary of financial results by
    segment. The following is a summary of significant factors
    impacting the segments’ financial results.

BioScience

Pre-tax income decreased 2% in 2010
    and increased 5% in 2009. Sales growth for select higher-margin
    products in 2010 was more than offset by pricing pressures for
    certain plasma protein (including Antibody Therapy) products,
    manufacturing cost inefficiencies for plasma-based therapies and
    vaccines, the impact of healthcare reform and increased
    inventory reserves. Also contributing to the decline in pre-tax
    income was an expansion of certain sales resources and increased
    spending on new marketing and promotional programs.

The primary drivers of the increase in pre-tax income in 2009
    were continued gross margin expansion driven by strong sales of
    higher-margin products, fueled principally by the continued
    customer adoption of ADVATE therapy and increased demand and
    improved pricing for GAMMAGARD LIQUID therapy and certain other
    plasma protein products, as well as continued manufacturing
    improvements. Partially offsetting the growth in 2009 was
    increased R&D spending, the unfavorable impact of lower
    FSME-IMMUN vaccine sales and the unfavorable impact of foreign
    currency.

Medication Delivery

Pre-tax income decreased
    59% in 2010 and increased 28% in 2009. The decrease in 2010 was
    due to a $588 million COLLEAGUE infusion pump charge, an
    impairment charge of $112 million associated with the
    company’s agreement to divest its U.S. generic
    injectables business and a charge of $62 million associated
    with litigation related to the company’s 2008 recall of its
    heparin sodium injection products in the United States.
    Partially offsetting the negative impact of these charges were
    sales growth across multiple product categories, gross margin
    improvements, a reduction in R&D spending due to
    optimization efforts and the favorable impact of foreign
    currency.

Included in pre-tax income in 2009 and 2008 were
    $27 million and $125 million, respectively, of charges
    and other costs relating to the COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion
    pumps. Also included in pre-tax income was a $54 million
    charge in 2009 related to the discontinuation of the
    company’s SOLOMIX drug delivery system in development and a
    $31 million charge in 2008 related to the discontinuation
    of the CLEARSHOT pre-filled syringe program. Aside from the
    impact of these items, pre-tax earnings in 2009 benefited from
    gross margin improvements resulting from favorable product mix,
    principally from increased sales of IV solutions, global
    injectables, anesthesia and nutritional products. Foreign
    currency had an unfavorable impact on growth in 2009.

Refer to Note 3 for further information on the U.S. generic
    injectables business impairment charge, Note 5 for further
    information on the infusion pump charges and Note 2 for
    further information on the litigation-related charge.


Renal

Pre-tax income increased 15% in 2010 and
    decreased 4% in 2009. The increase in 2010 was primarily due to
    continued growth of PD Therapy patients, partially offset by an
    inventory impairment charge due to manufacturing issues with
    certain PD solutions at the company’s Castlebar, Ireland
    facility. R&D spending in the Renal segment increased in
    both years, driven by costs associated with the development of a
    home hemodialysis system.

Other

Certain income and expense amounts are
    not allocated to a segment. These amounts are detailed in the
    table in Note 12 and include net interest expense, certain
    foreign exchange fluctuations (principally relating to
    intercompany receivables, payables and loans denominated in a
    foreign currency) and the majority of the foreign currency
    hedging activities, corporate headquarters costs, stock
    compensation expense, income and expense related to certain
    non-strategic investments, certain employee benefit plan costs,
    certain nonrecurring gains and losses, certain charges (such as
    the Greece receivables, business optimization and certain
    IPR&D charges), and the revenues and costs related to the
    manufacturing, distribution and other transition agreements with
    Fenwal.

Refer to the previous discussions for further information
    regarding net interest expense, the Greece receivables, business
    optimization and IPR&D charges, and Note 8 for further
    information regarding stock compensation expense.

Income
    Taxes

Effective
    Income Tax Rate

The effective income tax rate was 25% in 2010, 19% in 2009 and
    18% in 2008. The company anticipates that the effective income
    tax rate, calculated in accordance with GAAP, will be
    approximately 20.5% to 21.5% in 2011, excluding any impact from
    additional audit developments or other special items.

The company’s effective tax rate differs from the
    U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain
    operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local
    taxes and foreign taxes that are different than the
    U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition, as discussed
    further below, the company’s effective income tax rate can
    be impacted in each year by discrete factors or events. Refer to
    Note 10 for further information regarding the
    company’s income taxes.


The increase in the effective tax rate in 2010 was principally
    due to a $588 million charge related to the recall of
    COLLEAGUE infusion pumps from the U.S. market for which
    there was no tax benefit recognized, a $39 million
    write-off of a deferred tax asset as a result of a change in the
    tax treatment of reimbursements under the Medicare Part D
    retiree prescription drug subsidy program under healthcare
    reform legislation enacted in the United States, a charge
    related to contingent tax matters, and $34 million of
    IPR&D charges for which the tax benefit was lower than the
    U.S. statutory rate. These items were partially offset by
    the tax benefits from the U.S. generic injectables business
    impairment charge, the business optimization charge and a charge
    related to litigation associated with the company’s 2008
    recall of its heparin sodium injection products in the United
    States, in addition to a change in the earnings mix from higher
    tax to lower tax rate jurisdictions compared to the prior year
    period.


The effective tax rate for 2009 was impacted by greater income
    in jurisdictions with higher tax rates, partially offset by
    $51 million of income tax benefit from the use of foreign
    tax losses.


The effective tax rate for 2008 was impacted by $29 million
    of valuation allowance reductions on net operating loss
    carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions due to profitability
    improvements, $8 million of income tax benefit related to
    the extension of R&D tax credits in the United States and
    $14 million of additional U.S. income tax expense
    related to foreign earnings which were no longer considered
    indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States because the
    company planned to remit these earnings to the United States in
    the foreseeable future.


Uncertain
    Tax Positions

Baxter expects to reduce the amount of its liability for
    uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months by
    approximately $280 million due principally to the
    resolution of certain multi-jurisdictional transfer pricing
    issues and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.
    While the final outcome of these matters is inherently
    uncertain, the company believes it has made adequate tax
    provisions for all years subject to examination.

Income
    and Earnings per Diluted Share Amounts

Net income attributable to Baxter was $1.4 billion in 2010,
    $2.2 billion in 2009 and $2.0 billion in 2008. The
    corresponding net earnings per diluted share were $2.39 in 2010,
    $3.59 in 2009 and $3.16 in 2008. The significant factors and
    events causing the net changes from 2009 to 2010 and from 2008
    to 2009 are discussed above.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash
    Flows from Operations

Cash flows from operations increased in both 2010 and 2009,
    totaling $3.0 billion in 2010, $2.9 billion in 2009
    and $2.5 billion in 2008. The increases in cash flows in
    2010 and 2009 were primarily due to higher earnings (before
    non-cash items) and the other factors discussed below.

Accounts
    Receivable

Cash flows relating to accounts receivable increased in 2010 and
    decreased in 2009. Days sales outstanding increased from
    51.2 days at December 31, 2009 to 52.5 days at
    December 31, 2010, primarily due to longer collection
    periods in certain international markets and the geographic mix
    of sales. Days sales outstanding in the United States were less
    than 30 days. The decrease in cash flows in 2009 was
    primarily due to the geographic mix of sales, an increase in
    collection periods in certain international locations and a
    decrease in factoring of receivables, partially offset by
    improved collection periods in the United States.

Inventories

Cash flows from inventories improved in both 2010 and 2009. The
    following is a summary of inventories at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, as well as inventory turns by segment for 2010, 2009
    and 2008. Inventory turns for the year are calculated as the
    annualized fourth quarter cost of sales divided by the year-end
    inventory balance.

The higher inventory turns for the total company in 2010 were
    driven by a reduction of plasma-related inventories in the
    BioScience segment, as well as the favorable impact of the 2010
    business optimization charge. Of the total charge,
    $132 million was recorded in cost of sales, which increased
    total company turns by 0.23. Refer to Note 5 for further
    information regarding this charge. The higher inventory turns
    for the total company in 2009 were principally due to increased
    sales in the Medication Delivery segment, partially offset by an
    increase of plasma-related inventories in the BioScience segment.

Other

Cash outflows related to liabilities, business optimization and
    restructuring payments and other increased in 2010 and decreased
    in 2009. Cash contributions to the company’s pension plans,
    which totaled $416 million, $170 million and
    $287 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were
    partially offset in each year by lower outflows relating to
    accounts payable and accrued liabilities.


Cash
    Flows from Investing Activities

Capital
    Expenditures

Capital expenditures totaled $963 million in 2010,
    $1.0 billion in 2009 and $954 million in 2008. The
    company’s investments in capital expenditures in 2010 were
    focused on projects that enhance the company’s cost
    structure and manufacturing capabilities, particularly as they
    relate to the company’s nutritional, anesthesia and PD
    products, as well as plasma and recombinant manufacturing
    platforms. A significant portion of the company’s
    investment in capital expenditures supports its strategy of
    geographic expansion with select investments in growing markets.
    In addition, the company continues to invest to support the
    company’s ongoing strategic focus on R&D with the
    expansion of research facilities, manufacturing sites and
    laboratories. Capital expenditures also included the
    company’s multi-year initiative to implement a global
    enterprise resource planning system that will consolidate and
    standardize business processes, data and systems.

The company makes investments in capital expenditures at a level
    sufficient to support the strategic and operating needs of the
    businesses, and continues to improve capital allocation
    discipline in making investments to enhance long-term growth.
    The company expects to invest approximately $1.0 billion in
    capital expenditures in 2011.

Acquisitions
    and Investments

Net cash outflows relating to acquisitions and investments were
    $319 million in 2010, $156 million in 2009 and
    $99 million in 2008.

The cash outflows in 2010 principally included a net cash
    outflow of $235 million related to the acquisition of
    ApaTech. Also included in net cash outflows in 2010 were
    payments of $30 million related to the licensing and
    acquisition of hemophilia-related intellectual property and
    other assets from Archemix, $28 million related to a
    manufacturing, supply and distribution agreement with Kamada for
    GLASSIA, and $18 million related to the company’s
    collaboration agreement for the development of a home HD machine
    with DEKA.

The cash outflows in 2009 principally related to a
    $100 million payment for the exclusive distribution of
    SIGMA’s infusion pumps in the United States and
    international markets, a 40 percent equity stake in SIGMA
    and an option to purchase the remaining portion of SIGMA.
    Additionally, in 2009 the company acquired Edwards CRRT for
    $56 million. Refer to Note 4 for further information
    regarding the acquisitions of and investments in ApaTech,
    Archemix, SIGMA and Edwards CRRT.

The cash outflows in 2008 principally related to an IV
    solutions business in China, the company’s in-licensing
    agreement to market and distribute Innocoll’s gentamicin
    surgical implant in the United States, the acquisition of
    certain technology applicable to the BioScience business, and
    payments related to the company’s agreements with Nycomed
    Pharma AS and Nektar Therapeutics.

Divestitures
    and Other

Net cash inflows relating to divestitures and other activities
    were $18 million in 2010, $24 million in 2009 and
    $60 million in 2008. Cash inflows in 2010 principally
    consisted of proceeds from the divestiture of certain Renal
    Therapy Services centers in Australia. Cash inflows in 2009 and
    2008 principally consisted of cash collections related to the
    company’s securitization arrangements.

Cash
    Flows from Financing Activities

Debt
    Issuances, Net of Payments of Obligations

Debt issuances, net of payments of obligations, were net inflows
    totaling $91 million in 2010 and $473 million in 2009
    and net outflows totaling $79 million in 2008.

In March 2010, the company issued $600 million of senior
    unsecured notes, with $300 million maturing in March 2013
    and bearing a 1.8% coupon rate, and $300 million maturing
    in March 2020 and bearing a 4.25% coupon rate. In February 2009,
    the company issued $350 million of senior unsecured notes,
    which mature in March 2014 and bear a 4.0% coupon rate. In
    August 2009, the company issued $500 million of senior
    unsecured notes, which mature in August 2019 and bear a 4.5%
    coupon rate. In May 2008, the company issued $500 million
    of senior unsecured notes, maturing in June 2018 and bearing a
    5.375% coupon rate. In


addition, during 2008, the company issued commercial paper, of
    which $200 million was outstanding as of December 31,
    2008, with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.55%. The net
    proceeds from these issuances were used for general corporate
    purposes, including the refinancing of indebtedness, the
    repayment of $200 million of outstanding commercial paper
    in 2009 and the settlement of cross-currency swaps in 2008. In
    2010, the company repaid its 4.75% $500 million notes and
    settled related cross-currency swaps, both upon their maturity
    in October 2010, resulting in a cash outflow of
    $545 million. In 2009, the company repaid approximately
    $160 million of outstanding borrowings related to the
    company’s Euro-denominated credit facility (further
    discussed below). The company repaid its 5.196% notes,
    which approximated $250 million, upon their maturity in
    February 2008.

Other
    Financing Activities

Cash dividend payments totaled $688 million in 2010,
    $632 million in 2009 and $546 million in 2008. In
    November 2008, the board of directors declared a quarterly
    dividend of $0.26 per share ($1.04 per share on an annualized
    basis), representing an increase of 20% over the previous
    quarterly rate. In November 2009, the board of directors
    declared a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share ($1.16 per
    share on an annualized basis), representing an increase of 12%
    over the previous quarterly rate. In November 2010, the board of
    directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share
    ($1.24 per share on an annualized basis), which was paid on
    January 5, 2011 to shareholders of record as of
    December 10, 2010. The dividend represented an increase of
    7% over the previous quarterly rate of $0.29 per share.

Proceeds and realized excess tax benefits from stock issued
    under employee benefit plans totaled $381 million in both
    2010 and 2009 and $680 million in 2008. In 2010, an
    increase in stock option exercises was offset by a decrease in
    realized excess tax benefits. The decrease in 2009 was due to a
    decrease in stock option exercises. Realized excess tax
    benefits, which were $41 million in 2010, $96 million
    in 2009 and $112 million in 2008, are presented in the
    consolidated statements of cash flows as an outflow in the
    operating section and an inflow in the financing section.

As authorized by the board of directors, the company repurchases
    its stock from time to time depending on the company’s cash
    flows, net debt level and market conditions. The company
    purchased 30 million shares for $1.5 billion in 2010,
    23 million shares for $1.2 billion in 2009 and
    32 million shares for $2.0 billion in 2008. In July
    2009, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to
    $2.0 billion of the company’s common stock. At
    December 31, 2010, approximately $500 million remained
    available under the July 2009 authorization. In December 2010,
    the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an
    additional $2.5 billion of the company’s common stock.
    No shares had been repurchased under this authorization as of
    December 31, 2010.

Credit
    Facilities, Access to Capital, Credit Ratings and Net Investment
    Hedges

Credit
    Facilities

The company’s primary revolving credit facility has a
    maximum capacity of $1.5 billion and matures in December
    2011. The company also maintains a Euro-denominated credit
    facility with a maximum capacity of approximately
    $400 million at December 31, 2010, which matures in
    January 2013. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were
    no outstanding borrowings under either of the two outstanding
    facilities. The company’s facilities enable the company to
    borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates
    (determined, in part, by the company’s credit ratings) and
    contain various covenants, including a maximum
    net-debt-to-capital ratio. At December 31, 2010, the
    company was in compliance with the financial covenants in these
    agreements. The non-performance of any financial institution
    supporting either of the credit facilities would reduce the
    maximum capacity of these facilities by each institution’s
    respective commitment. The company also maintains other credit
    arrangements, as described in Note 6.

Access to
    Capital

The company intends to fund short-term and long-term obligations
    as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from
    operations or by issuing additional debt or common stock. The
    company had $2.7 billion of cash and equivalents at
    December 31, 2010, with adequate cash available to meet
    operating requirements in each jurisdiction in which the company
    operates. The company invests its excess cash in


certificates of deposit and money market funds, and diversifies
    the concentration of cash among different financial institutions.

The company’s ability to generate cash flows from
    operations, issue debt or enter into other financing
    arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if
    there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s
    products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers,
    deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or
    credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in
    conditions. However, the company believes it has sufficient
    financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing
    arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms
    to support the company’s growth objectives.

The company continues to do business with foreign governments in
    certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy,
    that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic
    conditions. While the economic downturn has not significantly
    impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables,
    global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain
    countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays
    in the collection of receivables and credit losses. In 2010, the
    company recorded a charge of $28 million to write down its
    accounts receivable in Greece principally as a result of the
    Greek government’s plan to convert certain past due
    receivables into non-interest bearing bonds with maturities of
    one to three years. Refer to Note 1 for further information
    regarding this charge. Global economic conditions and
    customer-specific factors may require the company to

re-evaluate

the collectibility of its receivables and the company could
    potentially incur additional charges.

Credit
    Ratings

The company’s credit ratings at December 31, 2010 were
    as follows.

Standard & Poor’s

Fitch

Moody’s

Ratings

Stable

There were no changes in the company’s credit ratings in
    2010. Standard & Poor’s downgraded the
    company’s outlook from Positive to Stable in 2010.

If Baxter’s credit ratings or outlooks were to be
    downgraded, the company’s financing costs related to its
    credit arrangements and any future debt issuances could be
    unfavorably impacted. However, any future credit rating
    downgrade or change in outlook would not affect the
    company’s ability to draw on its credit facilities, and
    would not result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities
    of any of the company’s outstanding debt, unless, with
    respect to certain debt instruments, preceded by a change in
    control of the company.

Net
    Investment Hedges

In 2008, the company terminated its remaining net investment
    hedge portfolio and no longer has any outstanding net investment
    hedges. Of the net settlement payments in 2008,
    $540 million of cash outflows were included as payments of
    obligations in the financing section and $12 million of
    cash inflows were included in the operating section of the
    consolidated statement of cash flows. The net after-tax losses
    related to net investment hedge instruments recorded in other
    comprehensive income were $33 million in 2008.


Contractual
    Obligations

As of December 31, 2010, the company had contractual
    obligations, excluding accounts payable, accrued liabilities
    (other than the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits)
    and contingent liabilities, including contingent milestone
    payments associated with joint development and commercialization
    arrangements, payable or maturing in the following periods.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Baxter periodically enters into off-balance sheet arrangements.
    Certain contingencies arise in the normal course of business,
    and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in
    accordance with GAAP (such as contingent joint development and
    commercialization arrangement payments). Also, upon resolution
    of uncertainties, the company may incur charges in excess of
    presently established liabilities for certain matters (such as
    contractual indemnifications). For a discussion of the
    company’s significant off-balance sheet arrangements, refer
    to Note 6 to


the consolidated financial statements regarding joint
    development and commercialization arrangements and
    indemnifications, Note 7 regarding receivable
    securitizations and Note 11 regarding legal contingencies.

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK

The company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely
    impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
    The company’s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks
    to an acceptable level based on the company’s judgment of
    the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs.
    Refer to Note 7 for further information regarding the
    company’s financial instruments and hedging strategies.

Currency Risk

The company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with
    respect to recognized assets and liabilities, forecasted
    transactions and net assets denominated in the Euro, Japanese
    Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar,
    Brazilian Real and Colombian Peso. The company manages its
    foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows
    the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural
    offsets. In addition, the company uses derivative and
    nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net
    exposure to foreign exchange. Gains and losses on the hedging
    instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions
    and reduce the earnings and shareholders’ equity volatility
    relating to foreign exchange. Financial market and currency
    volatility may reduce the benefits of the company’s natural
    hedges and limit the company’s ability to cost-effectively
    hedge these exposures.

The company may use options, forwards and cross-currency swaps
    to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to
    forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and
    recognized assets and liabilities. The maximum term over which
    the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to
    forecasted transactions at December 31, 2010 is
    18 months. The company also enters into derivative
    instruments to hedge certain intercompany and third-party
    receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign
    currencies. The company historically hedged certain of its net
    investments in international affiliates, using a combination of
    debt denominated in foreign currencies and cross-currency swap
    agreements. As further discussed in Note 7, in 2008, the
    company terminated all of its remaining net investment hedges.

Currency restrictions enacted in Venezuela require Baxter to
    obtain approval from the Venezuelan government to exchange
    Venezuelan Bolivars for U.S. Dollars and require such
    exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by
    the government. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan
    government devalued the official exchange rate of 2.15 relative
    to the U.S. Dollar. The official exchange rate for imported
    goods classified as essential, such as food and medicine, was
    changed to 2.6, while the rate for payments for non-essential
    goods was changed to 4.3. In 2010, the majority of the
    company’s products imported into Venezuela were classified
    as essential goods and qualified for the 2.6 rate. Effective
    January 1, 2011, the Venezuelan government devalued the
    official currency for imported goods classified as essential to
    4.3. Since January 1, 2010, Venezuela has been designated
    as a highly inflationary economy under GAAP and as a result, the
    functional currency of the company’s subsidiary in
    Venezuela is the U.S. Dollar. The devaluation of the
    Venezuelan Bolivar and designation of Venezuela as highly
    inflationary did not have a material impact on the financial
    results of the company. As of December 31, 2010, the
    company’s subsidiary in Venezuela had net assets of
    $23 million denominated in the Venezuelan Bolivar. In 2010,
    net sales in Venezuela represented less than 1% of Baxter’s
    total net sales.

As part of its risk-management program, the company performs
    sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair
    value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to
    hypothetical and reasonably possible near-term movements in
    foreign exchange rates.

A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign
    exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at
    December 31, 2010, while not predictive in nature,
    indicated that if the U.S. Dollar uniformly fluctuated
    unfavorably by 10% against all currencies, on a

net-of-tax

basis, the net asset balance of $6 million with respect to
    those contracts would decrease by $41 million, resulting in
    a net liability position. A similar analysis performed with
    respect to option, forward and cross-currency swap contracts
    outstanding at December 31, 2009 indicated that, on a

net-of-tax

basis, the net liability balance of $69 million would
    increase by $69 million.


The sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of
    the foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at
    December 31, 2010 by replacing the actual exchange rates at
    December 31, 2010 with exchange rates that are 10%
    unfavorable to the actual exchange rates for each applicable
    currency. All other factors are held constant. These sensitivity
    analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates
    can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency
    may or may not be offset by losses from another currency. The
    analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the
    underlying hedged transactions and balances.

Interest
    Rate and Other Risks

The company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and
    cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in
    interest rates. The company’s policy is to manage interest
    costs using a mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt that the
    company believes is appropriate. To manage this mix in a
    cost-efficient manner, the company periodically enters into
    interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at
    specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating
    interest amounts calculated by reference to an

agreed-upon

notional amount. The company also periodically uses
    forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to
    hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in
    interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt.

As part of its risk management program, the company performs
    sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in
    earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates. A
    43 basis-point increase in interest rates (approximately 10% of
    the company’s weighted-average interest rate during
    2010) affecting the company’s financial instruments,
    including debt obligations and related derivatives, would have
    an immaterial effect on the company’s 2010, 2009 and 2008
    earnings and on the fair value of the company’s fixed-rate
    debt as of the end of each fiscal year.

As discussed in Note 7, the fair values of the
    company’s long-term litigation liabilities and related
    insurance receivables were computed by discounting the expected
    cash flows based on currently available information. A 10%
    movement in the assumed discount rate would have an immaterial
    effect on the fair values of those assets and liabilities.

With respect to the company’s investments in affiliates,
    the company believes any reasonably possible near-term losses in
    earnings, cash flows and fair values would not be material to
    the company’s consolidated financial position.

CHANGES
    IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements
    for recently adopted accounting pronouncements.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
    requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect
    the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses. A summary of the company’s significant accounting
    policies is included in Note 1. Certain of the
    company’s accounting policies are considered critical
    because these policies are the most important to the depiction
    of the company’s financial statements and require
    significant, difficult or complex judgments by the company,
    often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of
    matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results that
    differ from the company’s estimates could have an
    unfavorable effect on the company’s results of operations
    and financial position. The company applies estimation
    methodologies consistently from year to year. Other than changes
    required due to the issuance of new accounting pronouncements,
    there have been no significant changes in the company’s
    application of its critical accounting policies during 2010. The
    company’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed
    with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The
    following is a summary of accounting policies that the company
    considers critical to the consolidated financial statements.


Revenue
    Recognition and Related Provisions and Allowances

The company’s policy is to recognize revenues from product
    sales and services when earned. Specifically, revenue is
    recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    delivery has occurred (or services have been rendered), the
    price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably
    assured. The shipping terms for the majority of the
    company’s revenue arrangements are FOB destination. The
    recognition of revenue is delayed if there are significant
    post-delivery obligations, such as training, installation or
    other services.

The company sometimes enters into arrangements in which it
    commits to delivering multiple products or services to its
    customers. In these cases, total arrangement consideration is
    allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling
    prices. Then the allocated consideration is recognized as
    revenue in accordance with the principles described above.
    Selling prices are determined by applying a selling price
    hierarchy. Selling prices are determined using vendor specific
    objective evidence (VSOE), if it exists. Otherwise, selling
    prices are determined using third party evidence (TPE). If
    neither VSOE nor TPE is available, the company uses its best
    estimate of selling prices.

Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, chargebacks to
    wholesalers, and returns are provided for at the time the
    related sales are recorded, and are reflected as a reduction of
    sales. These estimates are reviewed periodically and, if
    necessary, revised, with any revisions recognized immediately as
    adjustments to sales.

The company periodically and systematically evaluates the
    collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the
    appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts. In determining the
    amount of the reserve, the company considers historical credit
    losses, the past-due status of receivables, payment history and
    other customer-specific information, and any other relevant
    factors or considerations.

The company also provides for the estimated costs that may be
    incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both
    probable and reasonably estimable, which is at the time the
    related revenue is recognized. The cost is determined based on
    actual company experience for the same or similar products as
    well as other relevant information. Estimates of future costs
    under the company’s warranty programs could change based on
    developments in the future. The company is not able to estimate
    the probability or amount of any future developments that could
    impact the reserves, but believes presently established reserves
    are adequate.

Pension
    and Other Postemployment Benefit (OPEB) Plans

The company provides pension and other postemployment benefits
    to certain of its employees. These employee benefit expenses are
    reported in the same line items in the consolidated income
    statement as the applicable employee’s compensation
    expense. The valuation of the funded status and net periodic
    benefit cost for the plans are calculated using actuarial
    assumptions. These assumptions are reviewed annually, and
    revised if appropriate. The significant assumptions include the
    following:

•

interest rates used to discount pension and OPEB plan
    liabilities;

•

the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets;

•

rates of increases in employee compensation (used in estimating
    liabilities);

•

anticipated future healthcare costs (used in estimating the OPEB
    plan liability); and

•

other assumptions involving demographic factors such as
    retirement, mortality and turnover (used in estimating
    liabilities).

Selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both short-term
    and long-term historical trends and known economic and market
    conditions at the time of the valuation (also called the
    measurement date). The use of different assumptions would result
    in different measures of the funded status and net cost. Actual
    results in the future could differ from expected results. The
    company is not able to estimate the probability of actual
    results differing from expected results, but believes its
    assumptions are appropriate.


The company’s key assumptions are listed in Note 9.
    The most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering
    U.S. and Puerto Rico employees, because these plans are the
    most significant to the company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Discount
    Rate Assumption

For the U.S. and Puerto Rico plans, at the measurement date
    (December 31, 2010), the company used a discount rate of
    5.45% and 5.40% to measure its benefit obligations for the
    pension plans and OPEB plan, respectively. This discount rate
    will be used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for
    these plans for 2011. The company used a broad population of
    approximately 260 Aa-rated corporate bonds as of
    December 31, 2010 to determine the discount rate
    assumption. All bonds were denominated in U.S. Dollars,
    with a minimum amount outstanding of $50 million. This
    population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of over
    500 Moody’s Aa rated, non-callable (or callable with
    make-whole provisions) bonds by eliminating the top
    10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust
    for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds Baxter
    would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its
    pension and OPEB plan liabilities. This portfolio of bonds was
    used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve,
    to discount the projected benefit payments for the U.S. and
    Puerto Rico plans. The discount rate is the single level rate
    that produces the same result as the spot rate curve.

For plans in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the Eurozone,
    the company uses a method essentially the same as that described
    for the U.S. and Puerto Rico plans. For the company’s
    other international plans, the discount rate is generally
    determined by reviewing country- and region-specific government
    and corporate bond interest rates.

To understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension
    and OPEB plan cost, the company performs a sensitivity analysis.
    Holding all other assumptions constant, for each 50 basis
    point (i.e., one-half of one percent) increase (decrease) in the
    discount rate, global pre-tax pension and OPEB plan cost would
    decrease (increase) by approximately $37 million.

Return on
    Plan Assets Assumption

In measuring net periodic cost for 2010, the company used a
    long-term expected rate of return of 8.50% for the pension plans
    covering U.S. and Puerto Rico employees. For measuring the
    net periodic benefit cost for these plans for 2011, this
    assumption will decrease to 8.25%. This assumption is not
    applicable to the company’s OPEB plan because it is not
    funded.

The company establishes the long-term asset return assumption
    based on a review of historical compound average asset returns,
    both company-specific and relating to the broad market (based on
    the company’s asset allocation), as well as an analysis of
    current market and economic information and future expectations.
    The current asset return assumption is supported by historical
    market experience for both the company’s actual and
    targeted asset allocation. In calculating net pension cost, the
    expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of
    plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan
    assets in a systematic manner over five years. The difference
    between this expected return and the actual return on plan
    assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss
    and is subject to amortization in the future.

To understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return
    assumption on net cost, the company performs a sensitivity
    analysis. Holding all other assumptions constant, for each
    50 basis point increase (decrease) in the asset return
    assumption, global pre-tax pension plan cost would decrease
    (increase) by approximately $17 million.

Other
    Assumptions

The company used the Retirement Plan 2000 mortality table to
    calculate the pension and OPEB plan benefit obligations for its
    plans in the United States and Puerto Rico. For all other
    pension plans, the company utilized country and region-specific
    mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit
    obligations. The company periodically analyzes and updates its
    assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement,
    mortality and turnover, considering historical experience as
    well as anticipated future trends.


The assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and
    future healthcare costs are based on historical experience,
    market trends, and anticipated future company actions. Refer to
    Note 9 for information regarding the sensitivity of the
    OPEB plan obligation and the total of the service and interest
    cost components of OPEB plan cost to potential changes in future
    healthcare costs.

Legal
    Contingencies

The company is involved in product liability, patent,
    commercial, regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in
    the normal course of business. Refer to Note 11 for further
    information. The company records a liability when a loss is
    considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
    If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, and no
    amount within the range is a better estimate, the minimum amount
    in the range is accrued. If a loss is not probable or a probable
    loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability is recorded.
    The company has established reserves for certain of its legal
    matters. The company is not able to estimate the amount or range
    of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for which
    there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already
    reserved. The company also records any insurance recoveries that
    are probable of occurring. At December 31, 2010, total
    legal liabilities were $170 million and total insurance
    receivables were $87 million.

The company’s loss estimates are generally developed in
    consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of
    potential results. With respect to the recording of any
    insurance recoveries, after completing the assessment and
    accounting for the company’s legal contingencies, the
    company separately and independently analyzes its insurance
    coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable
    of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be
    collected. In performing the assessment, the company reviews
    available information, including historical company-specific and
    market collection experience for similar claims, current facts
    and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim,
    the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or
    companies, and other relevant information.

While the liability of the company in connection with certain
    claims cannot be estimated with any certainty, and although the
    resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these
    matters could have a significant impact on the company’s
    results of operations and cash flows for that period, the
    outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position. While the company believes it has valid
    defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain,
    excessive verdicts do occur, and the company may in the future
    incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of
    claims.

Inventories

The company values its inventories at the lower of cost,
    determined using the

first-in,

first-out method, or market value. Market value for raw
    materials is based on replacement costs and market value for
    work in process and finished goods is based on net realizable
    value. The company reviews inventories on hand at least
    quarterly and records provisions for estimated excess,
    slow-moving and obsolete inventory, as well as inventory with a
    carrying value in excess of net realizable value. The regular
    and systematic inventory valuation reviews include a current
    assessment of future product demand, anticipated release of new
    products into the market (either by the company or its
    competitors), historical experience and product expiration.
    Uncertain timing of product approvals, variability in product
    launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product
    utilization all impact the estimates related to inventory
    valuation. Additional inventory provisions may be required if
    future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the
    company has estimated. The company is not able to estimate the
    probability of actual results differing from expected results,
    but believes its estimates are appropriate.

Deferred
    Tax Asset Valuation Allowances and Reserves for Uncertain Tax
    Positions

The company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more
    likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset
    will be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included
    in the company’s tax provision in the period of change. In
    determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, the
    company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history,
    expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods,
    and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood
    of realization of a deferred tax asset. The


realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are
    subject to change in the future, particularly if earnings of a
    subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected, or
    if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that
    could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary.

In the normal course of business, the company is audited by
    federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and is periodically
    challenged regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges
    relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation
    of income among various tax jurisdictions. The company believes
    the company’s tax positions comply with applicable tax law
    and the company intends to defend its positions. In evaluating
    the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the
    company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in
    accordance with GAAP, based on the technical support for the
    positions, the company’s past audit experience with similar
    situations, and potential interest and penalties related to the
    matters. The company’s results of operations and effective
    tax rate in a given period could be impacted if, upon final
    resolution with taxing authorities, the company prevailed in
    positions for which reserves have been established, or was
    required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.

Fair
    Value Measurements of Financial Assets and Liabilities

For financial assets that are measured using quoted prices in
    active markets, the fair value is the published market price per
    unit multiplied by the number of units held, without
    consideration of transaction costs. The majority of the
    derivatives entered into by the company are valued using
    internal valuation techniques as no quoted market prices exist
    for such instruments. The principal techniques used to value
    these instruments are discounted cash flow and Black-Scholes
    models. The key inputs, which are observable, depend on the type
    of derivative, and include contractual terms, counterparty
    credit risk, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates
    and volatility. Refer to the Financial Instrument Market Risk
    section above for disclosures regarding sensitivity analyses
    performed by the company and Note 7 for further information
    regarding the company’s financial instruments.

In addition, the company’s pension plan assets and
    contingent payments related to acquisitions and investments are
    valued at fair value on a recurring basis. The valuation of
    pension assets, which are recorded net of the plan’s
    liabilities, depends on the type of security the plan holds.
    Principally, the securities are valued using quoted prices in
    active markets or pricing matrices or models that incorporate
    observable market data inputs. Refer to the Pension and OPEB
    Plans section above and Note 9 for further information on
    the company’s pension plans. Contingent payments are valued
    using a discounted cash flow technique that reflects
    management’s expectations about probability of payment.
    Refer to Note 4 for further information on the
    company’s contingent payments relating to acquisitions and
    investments.

Valuation
    of Intangible Assets, Including IPR&D

The company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair
    value. Valuations are generally completed for business
    acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis,
    incorporating the stage of completion. The most significant
    estimates and assumptions inherent in the discounted cash flow
    analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash
    flows, the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in
    the future cash flows, the assessment of the asset’s life
    cycle, and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset,
    including consideration of technical, legal, regulatory,
    economic and other factors. Each of these factors and
    assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible
    asset.

Acquired IPR&D is the value assigned to acquired technology
    or products under development which have not received regulatory
    approval and have no alternative future use.

Beginning in 2009, the company adopted a new accounting standard
    for accounting for business combinations. Under this accounting
    standard, acquired IPR&D included in a business combination
    is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and is no
    longer expensed at the time of the acquisition. Development
    costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred.
    Upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or
    product, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is then accounted
    for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a
    straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. If the
    R&D project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived asset is
    charged to expense.


IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business
    combinations is expensed immediately. For such transactions,
    payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval
    are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of
    the related asset, and are classified as intangible assets.

Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with R&D
    projects, there is no assurance that actual results will not
    differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to
    prepare discounted cash flow analyses, nor that the R&D
    project will result in a successful commercial product.

Impairment
    of Assets

Goodwill is subject to impairment reviews annually, and whenever
    indicators of impairment exist. Intangible assets other than
    goodwill and other long-lived assets (such as fixed assets) are
    reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable. Refer to Note 1 for further
    information. The company’s impairment reviews are based on
    an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant
    judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense
    growth rates, changes in working capital use, foreign currency
    exchange rates, the selection of an appropriate discount rate,
    asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. The
    estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the
    company’s business plans and a market participant’s
    views of the company and similar companies. The use of
    alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease
    the estimated fair values of the assets, and potentially result
    in different impacts to the company’s results of
    operations. Actual results may differ from the company’s
    estimates.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

Stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date
    based on the fair value of the award, and the cost is recognized
    as expense ratably over the substantive vesting period.
    Determining the appropriate fair value model to use requires
    judgment. Determining the assumptions that enter into the model
    is highly subjective and also requires judgment. The
    company’s stock compensation costs principally relate to
    awards of stock options, and the significant assumptions include
    long-term projections regarding stock price volatility, employee
    exercise, post-vesting termination and pre-vesting forfeiture
    behaviors, interest rates and dividend yields.

The company uses the Black-Scholes model for estimating the fair
    value of stock options. The company’s expected volatility
    assumption is based on an equal weighting of the historical
    volatility of Baxter’s stock and the implied volatility
    from traded options on Baxter’s stock. The expected life
    assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise
    patterns and employee post-vesting termination behavior. The
    risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the option is
    based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
    time of grant. The dividend yield reflects historical experience
    as well as future expectations over the expected life of the
    option. The forfeiture rate used to calculate compensation
    expense is primarily based on historical pre-vesting employee
    forfeiture patterns. In finalizing its assumptions, the company
    also reviews comparable companies’ assumptions, as
    available in published surveys and in publicly available
    financial filings.

The pre-vesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to
    the actual forfeiture rate. Therefore, changes in the
    forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of
    expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period. Estimated
    forfeitures are reassessed each period based on historical
    experience and current projections for the future.

The use of different assumptions would result in different
    amounts of stock compensation expense. The fair value of an
    option is particularly impacted by the expected volatility and
    expected life assumptions. To understand the impact of changes
    in these assumptions on the fair value of an option, the company
    performs sensitivity analyses. Holding all other variables
    constant, if the expected volatility assumption used in valuing
    the stock options granted in 2010 was increased by
    100 basis points (i.e., one percent), the fair value of a
    stock option relating to one share of common stock would
    increase by approximately 4%, from $10.08 to $10.52. Holding all
    other variables constant (including the expected volatility
    assumption), if the expected life assumption used in valuing the
    stock options granted in 2010 was increased by one year, the
    fair value of a stock option relating to one share of common
    stock would increase by approximately 8%, from $10.08 to $10.90.


The company also grants performance share units (PSUs) as part
    of its stock compensation program. PSUs are earned by comparing
    the company’s growth in shareholder value relative to a
    performance peer group over a three-year period. Based on the
    company’s relative performance, the recipient of a PSU may
    earn a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant.
    The fair value of a PSU is estimated by the company at the grant
    date using a Monte Carlo model. A Monte Carlo model uses stock
    price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability
    of satisfying the market conditions and the resulting fair value
    of the award. The three primary inputs for the Monte Carlo model
    are the risk-free rate, volatility of returns and correlation of
    returns. The determination of the risk-free rate is similar to
    that described above relating to the valuation of stock options.
    The expected volatility and correlation assumptions are based on
    historical information.

The company is not able to estimate the probability of actual
    results differing from expected results, but believes the
    company’s assumptions are appropriate, based upon the
    requirements of accounting standards for stock compensation and
    the company’s historical and expected future experience.

Hedging
    Activities

As further discussed in Note 7 and in the Financial
    Instrument Market Risk section above, the company uses
    derivative instruments to hedge certain risks. As Baxter
    operates on a global basis, there is a risk to earnings
    associated with foreign exchange relating to the company’s
    recognized assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions
    denominated in foreign currencies. Compliance with accounting
    standards for derivatives and hedging activities and the
    company’s hedging policies requires the company to make
    judgments regarding the probability of anticipated hedged
    transactions. In making these estimates and assessments of
    probability, the company analyzes historical trends and expected
    future cash flows and plans. The estimates and assumptions used
    are consistent with the company’s business plans. If the
    company were to make different assessments of probability or
    make the assessments during a different fiscal period, the
    company’s results of operations for a given period would be
    different.

CERTAIN
    REGULATORY MATTERS

In July 2005, the company stopped shipment of COLLEAGUE infusion
    pumps in the United States. Following a number of Class I
    recalls (recalls at the highest priority level for the FDA)
    relating to the performance of the pumps, as well as the seizure
    litigation described in Note 11, the company entered into a
    Consent Decree in June 2006. Additional Class I recalls
    related to remediation and repair and maintenance activities
    were addressed by the company in 2007 and 2009. Pursuant to the
    Consent Decree, in July 2010 the FDA issued a final order
    regarding the recall of the company’s COLLEAGUE infusion
    pumps currently in use in the United States. The company is
    executing the recall over the two years following the final
    order by offering its customers an option to replace their
    COLLEAGUE infusion pumps or receive monetary consideration.
    Under the replacement option, the company’s customers may
    receive SIGMA Spectrum infusion pumps in exchange for their
    COLLEAGUE infusion pumps. Alternatively, COLLEAGUE pump owners
    may receive the lesser of the pump’s depreciated value,
    which will be no less than $1,500 per single-channel pump and
    $3,000 per triple-channel pump, or the purchase price. The
    company will permit lessees to terminate their leases without
    penalty and will refund any prepaid, unused lease portion upon
    the return of the devices. As discussed in Note 5,
    following the FDA’s issuance of its initial order dated
    April 30, 2010, the company recorded a charge in the first
    quarter of 2010 related to the FDA’s order and other
    actions the company is undertaking outside the United States, in
    addition to a number of earlier charges in connection with its
    COLLEAGUE infusion pumps. As discussed in Note 11, the
    company received a subpoena from the Office of the United States
    Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois relating to the
    COLLEAGUE infusion pump in September 2009. It is possible that
    substantial additional cash and non-cash charges, including
    significant asset impairments related to the COLLEAGUE infusion
    pumps and related businesses, may be required in future periods
    based on new information, changes in estimates, the
    implementation of the recall in the United States, and other
    actions the company may be required to undertake in markets
    outside of the United States.

In June 2010, the company received a Warning Letter from the FDA
    in connection with an inspection of its Renal business’s
    McGaw Park, Illinois headquarters facility. The Warning Letter
    pertains to the processes by


which the company analyzes and addresses product complaints
    through corrective and preventative actions, and reports
    relevant information to the FDA. The company is working with the
    FDA to resolve these matters.

In January 2011, the company received a Warning Letter from the
    San Juan District Office of the FDA in connection with
    inspections of its Guayama and Jayuya, Puerto Rico facilities.
    The Warning Letter pertains to violations of Current Good
    Manufacturing Practices and the distribution of materials
    intended to assist customers with the use of certain nutrition
    products. Concerns about how the company investigates issues and
    reports relevant information to the FDA are also addressed. The
    company is working with the FDA to resolve these matters.

In January 2011, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) announced
    the review of Dianeal, Extraneal and Nutrineal peritoneal
    dialysis solutions manufactured in the company’s Castlebar,
    Ireland facility due to the potential presence of endotoxins in
    certain batches. The company is increasing supply of these
    products in its other manufacturing facilities as the EMA has
    allowed the company to temporarily import these products into
    the European Union. The company is working with the EMA to
    resolve these matters.

While the company continues to work to resolve the issues
    described above, there can be no assurance that additional costs
    or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that
    additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will
    not occur, that the company will not face civil claims for
    damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional
    charges or significant asset impairments may not be required,
    that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or
    that additional regulation will not be introduced that may
    adversely affect the company’s operations and consolidated
    financial statements. See Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional discussion of regulatory matters.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of
    Operations

Baxter International Inc. (Baxter or the company) develops,
    manufactures and markets products that save and sustain the
    lives of people with hemophilia, immune disorders, infectious
    diseases, kidney disease, trauma, and other chronic and acute
    medical conditions. As a global, diversified healthcare company,
    Baxter applies a unique combination of expertise in medical
    devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to create products
    that advance patient care worldwide. The company operates in
    three segments, which are described in Note 12.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the
    company to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
    amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

Basis of
    Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Baxter and its majority-owned subsidiaries, any minority-owned
    subsidiaries that Baxter controls, and variable interest
    entities (VIEs) in which Baxter is the primary beneficiary,
    after elimination of intercompany transactions. As of
    December 31, 2010, the carrying amounts of consolidated
    VIEs’ assets and liabilities were not material to
    Baxter’s consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

The company recognizes revenues from product sales and services
    when earned. Specifically, revenue is recognized when persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred (or
    services have been rendered), the price is fixed or
    determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For
    product sales, revenue is not recognized until title and risk of
    loss have transferred to the customer. The shipping terms for
    the majority of the company’s revenue arrangements are FOB
    destination. The recognition of revenue is delayed if there are
    significant post-delivery obligations, such as training,
    installation or other services. Provisions for discounts,
    rebates to customers, chargebacks to wholesalers and returns are
    provided for at the time the related sales are recorded, and are
    reflected as a reduction of net sales.

The company sometimes enters into arrangements in which it
    commits to delivering multiple products or services to its
    customers. In these cases, total arrangement consideration is
    allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling
    prices. Then the allocated consideration is recognized as
    revenue in accordance with the principles described above.
    Selling prices are determined by applying a selling price
    hierarchy. Selling prices are determined using vendor specific
    objective evidence (VSOE), if it exists. Otherwise, selling
    prices are determined using third party evidence (TPE). If
    neither VSOE nor TPE is available, the company uses its best
    estimate of selling prices.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

In the normal course of business, the company provides credit to
    its customers, performs credit evaluations of these customers
    and maintains reserves for potential credit losses. In
    determining the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts,
    the company considers, among other items, historical credit
    losses, the past-due status of receivables, payment histories
    and other customer-specific information. Receivables are written
    off when the company determines they are uncollectible. The
    allowance for doubtful accounts was $139 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $118 million at
    December 31, 2009.

The company recorded a charge of $28 million in the second
    quarter of 2010 to write down its accounts receivable in Greece
    principally as a result of the Greek government’s plan to
    convert certain past due receivables into non-interest bearing
    bonds with maturities of one to three years. The charge,
    computed by taking into consideration, among other factors, the
    imputed discount of the outstanding receivables based upon


publicly traded Greek government bonds with similar terms, was
    included in marketing and administrative expenses. As it relates
    to these and other receivables, changes in economic conditions
    and customer-specific factors may require the company to
    re-evaluate the collectibility of its receivables and the
    company could potentially incur additional charges.

Product
    Warranties

The company provides for the estimated costs relating to product
    warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The
    cost is determined based on actual company experience for the
    same or similar products, as well as other relevant information.
    Product warranty liabilities are adjusted based on changes in
    estimates.

Cash and
    Equivalents

Cash and equivalents include cash, certificates of deposit and
    money market funds with an original maturity of three months or
    less.

    materials is based on replacement costs, and market value for
    work in process and finished goods is based on net realizable
    value. The inventory amounts above are stated net of reserves
    for excess and obsolete inventory, which totaled
    $359 million at December 31, 2010 and
    $273 million at December 31, 2009. The increase in
    inventory reserves in 2010 was principally driven by excess
    vaccine inventory in the BioScience segment.

Depreciation and amortization expense is calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    related assets, which range from 20 to 50 years for
    buildings and improvements and from three to 15 years for
    machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized
    over the life of the related facility lease (including any
    renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is
    shorter. Baxter capitalizes in machinery and equipment certain
    computer software and software development costs incurred in
    connection with developing or obtaining software for internal
    use. Capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line
    basis over the estimated useful lives of the software.
    Straight-line and accelerated methods of depreciation are used
    for income tax purposes. Depreciation and amortization expense
    was $592 million in 2010, $557 million in 2009 and
    $553 million in 2008. Repairs and maintenance expense was
    $254 million in 2010, $251 million in 2009 and
    $242 million in 2008.


Acquisitions

Results of operations of acquired companies are included in the
    company’s results of operations as of the respective
    acquisition dates. The purchase price of each acquisition is
    allocated to the net assets acquired based on estimates of their
    fair values at the date of the acquisition. Contingent
    consideration is recognized at the estimated fair value on the
    acquisition date. Any purchase price in excess of these net
    assets is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of purchase price
    in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final
    determination of fair values.

Business
    Optimization and Restructuring Costs

The company records liabilities for costs associated with exit
    or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is
    incurred. Employee termination costs are primarily recorded when
    actions are probable and estimable. Costs for one-time
    termination benefits in which the employee is required to render
    service until termination in order to receive the benefits are
    recognized ratably over the future service period.

Research
    and Development

Research and development (R&D) costs are expensed as
    incurred. Acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D) is the value
    assigned to acquired technology or products under development
    which have not received regulatory approval and have no
    alternative future use. Valuations are generally completed for
    business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis,
    incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of
    market participant assumptions. The most significant estimates
    and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis
    include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows,
    the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the
    future cash flows, the assessment of the asset’s life
    cycle, and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset,
    including consideration of technical, legal, regulatory,
    economic and other factors. Each of these factors can
    significantly affect the value of the IPR&D.

Beginning in 2009, the company adopted a new accounting standard
    for accounting for business combinations. Under the new
    accounting standard, acquired IPR&D included in a business
    combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible
    asset and is no longer expensed at the time of the acquisition.
    Development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as
    incurred. Upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related
    technology or product, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is
    then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and
    amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful
    life, subject to impairment reviews as discussed below. If the
    R&D project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived asset is
    charged to expense.

IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business
    acquisitions is expensed immediately. Payments made to third
    parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and
    amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset,
    and are classified as intangible assets.

Impairment
    Reviews

Baxter has made and continues to make significant investments in
    assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment,
    which relate to potential new products or modifications to
    existing products. The company’s ability to realize value
    from these investments is contingent on, among other things,
    regulatory approval and market acceptance of these new or
    modified products. The company may not be able to realize the
    expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting
    in asset impairments in the future.

Goodwill

Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an impairment
    review annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist. An
    impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting
    unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. The company
    measures goodwill for impairment based on its reportable
    segments, which are BioScience, Medication Delivery and Renal.
    An impairment charge would be recorded for the difference
    between the carrying value and the present value of estimated
    future cash flows discounted using a risk-free market rate
    adjusted for a market participant’s view of similar
    companies and perceived risks in the cash flows, which
    represents the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. As of
    December 31, 2010, the fair


values of the company’s reporting units were substantially
    in excess of their carrying values. Baxter’s market
    capitalization as of December 31, 2010 was approximately
    $29 billion.

Other
    Long-Lived Assets

The company reviews the carrying amounts of long-lived assets
    other than goodwill for potential impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
    asset may not be recoverable. Examples of such a change in
    circumstances include a significant decrease in market price, a
    significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset is being used, or a significant adverse change in the
    legal or business climate. In evaluating recoverability, the
    company groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level such
    that the identifiable cash flows relating to the group are
    largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and
    liabilities. The company then compares the carrying amounts of
    the assets or asset groups with the related estimated
    undiscounted future cash flows. In the event impairment exists,
    an impairment charge would be recorded as the amount by which
    the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair
    value. Depending on the asset and the availability of
    information, fair value may be determined by reference to
    estimated selling values of assets in similar condition, or by
    using a discounted cash flow model. In addition, the remaining
    amortization period for the impaired asset would be reassessed
    and, if necessary, revised.

Earnings
    per Share

The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share
    (EPS) is net income attributable to Baxter. The denominator for
    basic EPS is the weighted-average number of common shares
    outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of
    outstanding employee stock options, performance share units and
    restricted stock units is reflected in the denominator for
    diluted EPS using the treasury stock method.

The following is a reconciliation of basic shares to diluted
    shares.

years ended December 31 (in millions)




Basic shares




Effect of dilutive securities




Diluted shares




The computation of diluted EPS excluded employee stock options
    to purchase 27 million, 16 million and 8 million
    shares in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, because the effect
    would have been anti-dilutive.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Shipping costs, which are costs incurred to physically move
    product from Baxter’s premises to the customer’s
    premises, are classified as marketing and administrative
    expenses. Handling costs, which are costs incurred to store,
    move and prepare products for shipment, are classified as cost
    of sales. Approximately $233 million in 2010,
    $220 million in 2009 and $237 million in 2008 of
    shipping costs were classified in marketing and administrative
    expenses.

Income
    Taxes

Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of
    temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting
    based on enacted tax laws and rates. The company maintains
    valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all
    or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized. With
    respect to uncertain tax positions, the company determines
    whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained
    upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.
    Any tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition
    threshold is measured and recognized in the consolidated
    financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that is
    greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement. The liability relating to uncertain tax positions is
    classified as current in the consolidated balance sheets to the
    extent the company anticipates making a payment within one year.
    Interest and penalties associated with income taxes are
    classified in the income tax expense line in the consolidated
    statements of income and were not material.


Foreign
    Currency Translation

Currency translation adjustments (CTA) related to foreign
    operations are principally included in other comprehensive
    income (OCI). For foreign operations in highly inflationary
    economies, translation gains and losses are included in other
    expense, net, and were not material.

Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes all changes in shareholders’
    equity that do not arise from transactions with shareholders,
    and consists of net income, CTA, pension and other employee
    benefits, realized net losses on hedges of net investments in
    foreign operations, unrealized gains and losses on cash flow
    hedges and unrealized gains and losses on unrestricted

available-for-sale

marketable equity securities. The

net-of-tax

components of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), a
    component of shareholders’ equity, were as follows.

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or
    liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and
    are classified as short-term or long-term based on the scheduled
    maturity of the instrument. Based upon the exposure being
    hedged, the company designates its hedging instruments as cash
    flow or fair value hedges.

For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective
    as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is
    accumulated in AOCI and then recognized in earnings consistent
    with the underlying hedged item. Option premiums or net premiums
    paid are initially recorded as assets and reclassified to OCI
    over the life of the option, and then recognized in earnings
    consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flow hedges are
    classified in other expense, net, cost of sales, and net
    interest expense, and primarily related to a hedge of
    U.S. Dollar-denominated debt issued by a foreign
    subsidiary, forecasted intercompany sales denominated in foreign
    currencies and anticipated issuances of debt, respectively.

For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective
    as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is
    recognized immediately to earnings, and offsets the gain or loss
    on the underlying hedged item. Fair value hedges are classified
    in net interest expense, as they hedge the interest rate risk
    associated with certain of the company’s fixed-rate debt.

For each derivative or nonderivative instrument that is
    designated and effective as a hedge of a net investment in a
    foreign operation, the gain or loss is recorded in OCI, with any
    hedge ineffectiveness recorded immediately in net interest
    expense. As with CTA, upon sale or liquidation of an investment
    in a foreign entity, the amount attributable to that entity and
    accumulated in AOCI would be removed from AOCI and reported as
    part of the gain or loss in the period during which the sale or
    liquidation of the investment occurs.

For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges,
    the change in fair value, which substantially offsets the change
    in book value of the hedged items, is recorded directly to other
    expense, net.

If it is determined that a derivative or nonderivative hedging
    instrument is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company
    discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If the company
    removes the cash flow hedge designation because the hedged
    forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, any
    gains or losses are immediately reclassified from AOCI to
    earnings. Gains or losses relating to terminations of effective
    cash flow hedges in which the forecasted transactions are still
    probable of occurring are deferred and recognized consistent
    with the income or loss recognition of the underlying hedged
    items. If the company terminates a fair value hedge, an amount
    equal to the cumulative fair value adjustment to the hedged
    items at the date of termination is amortized to earnings over
    the remaining term of the hedged item.


Derivatives, including those that are not designated as a hedge,
    are principally classified in the operating section of the
    consolidated statements of cash flows, in the same category as
    the related consolidated balance sheet account.

Refer to the Foreign Currency and Interest Rate Risk Management
    section of Note 7 for information regarding the
    company’s derivative and hedging activities.

Changes
    in Accounting Standards

Transfers
    of Financial Assets

On January 1, 2010, the company adopted a new accounting
    standard relating to the accounting for transfers of financial
    assets. The new standard eliminates the concept of a qualifying
    special-purpose entity and clarifies existing GAAP as it relates
    to determining whether a transferor has surrendered control over
    transferred financial assets. The standard limits the
    circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a
    financial asset, should be derecognized when the transferor has
    not transferred the entire original financial asset to an entity
    that is not consolidated with the transferor in the financial
    statements presented

and/or

when
    the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred
    financial asset. The standard also requires enhanced disclosures
    about transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s
    continuing involvement with transferred financial assets. The
    new standard was applied prospectively on January 1, 2010,
    except for the disclosure requirements, which have been applied
    retrospectively for all periods presented. The new standard did
    not impact the company’s consolidated financial statements.
    Refer to Note 7 for disclosures provided in connection with
    this new standard.

Variable
    Interest Entities

On January 1, 2010, the company adopted a new standard that
    changes the consolidation model for VIEs. The new standard
    requires an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination
    of the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has
    both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and
    has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive
    benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant
    to the VIE. The standard requires ongoing reassessments of
    whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The
    standard expands the disclosure requirements for enterprises
    with a variable interest in a VIE. With respect to the VIEs that
    were consolidated by the company as of December 31, 2009,
    the first quarter 2010 adoption of a new accounting standard on
    VIEs did not change the company’s determination that it is
    the primary beneficiary of those VIEs. During 2010, the company
    did not enter into any new arrangements in which it determined
    that the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.

The amortization expense for intangible assets was
    $79 million in 2010, $63 million in 2009 and
    $53 million in 2008. At December 31, 2010, the
    anticipated annual amortization expense for intangible assets
    recorded as of December 31, 2010 is $66 million in
    2011, $63 million in 2012, $61 million in 2013,
    $58 million in 2014 and $56 million in 2015. The
    decrease in other intangible assets, net primarily related to
    amortization expense for the year and an impairment charge
    associated with the company’s agreement to divest its U.S.
    generic injectables business, partially offset by the
    acquisition of ApaTech and the agreement with Kamada Ltd.
    (Kamada). The manufacturing, supply and distribution agreement
    with Kamada for GLASSIA [Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor (Human)],
    the first ready-to-use liquid alpha1-proteinase inhibitor,
    provides the company with exclusive distribution rights in the
    United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. This
    BioScience segment arrangement included up-front and milestone
    payments of $28 million, which are included in the other
    intangible asset category and are principally being amortized on
    a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of five
    years. Refer to Note 4 for further information regarding
    ApaTech and Note 3 regarding the U.S. generic injectables
    business impairment charge. Additionally, as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, intangible assets not subject
    to amortization, which included a trademark with an indefinite
    life and certain acquired IPR&D associated with products
    that have not yet received regulatory approval, totaled
    $31 million.

During 2010, the company recorded a $112 million impairment
    charge associated with the company’s agreement to divest
    its U.S. generic injectables business. See Note 3 for
    further information about this charge.


During 2009, the company recorded a $54 million charge
    associated with the discontinuation of the company’s
    SOLOMIX drug delivery system in development based on technical
    issues which negatively impacted the expected profitability of
    the product. During 2008, the company recorded a
    $31 million charge related to the company’s decision
    to discontinue its CLEARSHOT pre-filled syringe program based on
    management’s assessment of the market demand and expected
    profitability for this product. Substantially all of the SOLOMIX
    and CLEARSHOT charges related to asset impairments, principally
    to write off manufacturing equipment. The litigation charge in
    2010 related to litigation associated with the company’s
    2008 recall of its heparin sodium injection products in the
    United States. All three impairment charges and the
    litigation-related charge were included in the Medication
    Delivery segment’s pre-tax income.

NOTE 3

SALE OF BUSINESSES

Generic
    Injectables Business

In October 2010, the company entered into a definitive agreement
    to divest its U.S. generic injectables business to Hikma
    Pharmaceuticals PLC (Hikma). The consideration for the
    divestiture arrangement totaled approximately $112 million,
    subject to closing adjustments. Hikma will acquire Baxter’s
    high-volume, generic injectable products in vials and ampoules,
    including chronic pain, anti-infective and anti-emetic products,
    along with a manufacturing facility located in Cherry Hill, New
    Jersey, and a warehouse and distribution center located in
    Memphis, Tennessee. Approximately 750 employees will also
    transfer as part of the transaction. The determination to sell
    this business was based on the company’s strategic decision
    to redirect resources toward its proprietary, enhanced packaging
    offerings and formulation technologies, consistent with the
    company’s focus on product differentiation. The transaction
    is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable
    regulatory approvals.

As a result of the divestiture agreement, the company recorded a
    $112 million impairment charge. The charge principally
    related to impairments of PP&E and intangible assets
    (primarily developed technology) to reflect the fair values of
    these assets based on the expected sale price of the business.

Net sales related to the U.S. generic injectables business,
    which are reported in the Medication Delivery segment, totaled
    $198 million, $170 million and $205 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Pre-tax earnings related to
    this business were not significant to Baxter’s consolidated
    financial statements. The impairment charge was included in
    other expense, net in the consolidated statement of income, and
    was included in the Medication Delivery segment’s pre-tax
    income.

Transfusion
    Therapies Business

In February 2007, the company divested substantially all of the
    assets and liabilities of its Transfusion Therapies (TT)
    business to an affiliate of TPG Capital, L.P. (TPG). TPG
    acquired the net assets of the TT business, including its
    product portfolio of manual and automated blood-collection
    products and storage equipment, as well as five manufacturing
    facilities, and established the new company as Fenwal Inc.
    (Fenwal). In 2008, as a result of the finalization of the net
    assets transferred in the divestiture, the company recorded an
    income adjustment to the gain on the sale of the business of
    $16 million.

Included in the arrangement were transition agreements to
    provide post-divestiture manufacturing, distribution and support
    services to Fenwal. Post-divestiture revenues associated with
    these transition agreements, which are reported at the corporate
    headquarters level and not allocated to a segment, totaled
    $46 million, $74 million and $174 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.


NOTE 4

ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, cash outflows related to the
    acquisitions of and investments in businesses and technologies
    totaled $319 million, $156 million and
    $99 million, respectively, and the company recorded
    IPR&D charges of $34 million in 2010 and
    $19 million in 2008. There were no IPR&D charges in
    2009. The following are the more significant acquisitions and
    investments, including licensing agreements, that require
    significant contingent milestone payments.


ApaTech

In March 2010, Baxter acquired ApaTech, an orthobiologic
    products company based in the United Kingdom. As a result of the
    acquisition, Baxter acquired ACTIFUSE, a silicate substituted
    calcium phosphate synthetic bone graft material which is
    currently marketed in the United States, Europe and other select
    markets around the world, and manufacturing and R&D
    facilities located in the United Kingdom, the United States and
    Germany. This acquisition complements the company’s
    existing commercial and technical capabilities in regenerative
    medicine. The total purchase price of up to $337 million
    was comprised of $247 million in up-front payments, as
    adjusted for closing date cash and net working capital-related
    adjustments, and contingent payments of up to $90 million,
    which are associated with the achievement of specified
    commercial milestones.

The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the
    fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
    acquisition date. The final allocation of the purchase price may
    result in adjustment to the recognized amounts of assets and
    liabilities; however, no material adjustments are anticipated.

Goodwill includes expected synergies and other benefits the
    company believes will result from the acquisition. The other
    intangible assets primarily relate to developed technology and
    are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated
    average useful life of nine years. The contingent payments of up
    to $90 million were recorded at their estimated fair value
    of $70 million. As of December 31, 2010, the estimated
    fair value of the contingent payments was $73 million, with
    changes in the estimated fair value recognized in earnings. The
    results of operations and assets and liabilities of ApaTech are
    included in the BioScience segment, and the goodwill is included
    in this reporting unit. A majority of the goodwill is not
    deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma impact of the ApaTech
    acquisition was not significant to the results of operations of
    the company.

Archemix

In December 2010, Baxter acquired all of the hemophilia-related
    assets of Archemix Corp. (Archemix), a privately-held
    biopharmaceutical company, and entered into an exclusive license
    agreement for certain related intellectual property assets. The
    lead product associated with the arrangement is ARC19499, a
    synthetic subcutaneously-administered hemophilia therapy which
    recently entered a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United Kingdom.
    This anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor program is an
    important addition to Baxter’s hemophilia development
    programs, which focus on longer-acting recombinant factor VIII,
    recombinant factor IX and non-intravenous therapies. The
    up-front payment associated with the transaction of
    $30 million was recognized as


an IPR&D expense as the technology had not received
    regulatory approval and has no alternative future use. Baxter
    may, in the future, be required to make contingent payments of
    up to $285 million based on the achievement of specified
    development and regulatory milestones.


SIGMA

In April 2009, the company entered into an exclusive three-year
    distribution agreement with SIGMA covering the United States and
    international markets. The agreement, which enables Baxter to
    immediately provide SIGMA’s Spectrum large volume infusion
    pumps to customers, as well as future products under
    development, complements Baxter’s infusion systems
    portfolio and next generation technologies. The arrangement also
    included a 40% equity stake in SIGMA, and an option to purchase
    the remaining equity of SIGMA, exercisable at any time over a
    three-year term. The arrangement included a $100 million
    up-front payment and additional payments of up to
    $130 million for the exercise of the purchase option as
    well as for SIGMA’s achievement of specified regulatory and
    commercial milestones.

Because Baxter’s option to purchase the remaining equity of
    SIGMA limits the ability of the existing equity holders to
    participate significantly in SIGMA’s profits and losses,
    and because the existing equity holders have the ability to make
    decisions about SIGMA’s activities that have a significant
    effect on SIGMA’s success, the company concluded that SIGMA
    is a VIE. Baxter is the primary beneficiary of the VIE due to
    its exposure to the majority of SIGMA’s expected losses or
    expected residual returns and the relationship between Baxter
    and SIGMA created by the exclusive distribution agreement, and
    the significance of that agreement. Accordingly, the company
    consolidated the financial statements of SIGMA beginning in
    April 2009 (the acquisition date), with the fair value of the
    equity owned by the existing SIGMA equity holders reported as
    noncontrolling interests. The creditors of SIGMA do not have
    recourse to the general credit of Baxter.

The following table summarizes the final allocation of fair
    value related to the arrangement at the acquisition date.

The amount allocated to IPR&D is being accounted for as an
    indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or
    discontinuation. The other intangible assets primarily relate to
    developed technology and are being amortized on a straight-line
    basis over an estimated average useful life of eight years. The
    fair value of the purchase option was estimated using the
    Black-Scholes model, and the fair value of the noncontrolling
    interests was estimated using a discounted cash flow model. The
    contingent payments of up to $70 million associated with
    SIGMA’s achievement of specified regulatory and commercial
    milestones were recorded at their estimated fair value of
    $62 million. As of December 31, 2010, the estimated
    fair value of the contingent payments was $52 million, with
    the change in the estimated fair value since inception
    principally due to Baxter’s payment of $15 million for
    the achievement of commercial milestones in 2010 and 2009. Other
    changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent payments
    are being recognized immediately in earnings. The results of
    operations and assets and liabilities of SIGMA are included in
    the Medication Delivery segment, and the goodwill is included in
    this reporting unit. The goodwill is deductible for tax
    purposes. The pro forma impact of the arrangement with SIGMA was
    not significant to the results of operations of the company.


Edwards
    CRRT

In August 2009, the company acquired Edwards CRRT. Continuous
    Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) provides a method of continuous
    yet adjustable fluid removal that can gradually remove excess
    fluid and waste products that build up with the acute impairment
    of kidney function, and is usually administered in an intensive
    care setting in the hospital. The acquisition expands
    Baxter’s existing CRRT business into new markets. The
    purchase price of $56 million was primarily allocated to
    other intangible assets and goodwill. The identified intangible
    assets of $28 million consisted of customer relationships
    and developed technology and are being amortized on a
    straight-line basis over an estimated average useful life of
    eight years. The goodwill of $28 million is deductible for
    tax purposes. The purchase price also included contingent
    payments of up to an additional $9 million based on the
    achievement of revenue objectives. These contingent purchase
    payments, which were recorded at their estimated fair value on
    the acquisition date, have been substantially paid as of
    December 31, 2010. The results of operations and assets and
    liabilities of Edwards CRRT are included in the Renal segment,
    and the goodwill is included in this reporting unit. The pro
    forma impact of the Edwards CRRT acquisition was not significant
    to the results of operations of the company.

NOTE 5

INFUSION PUMP AND BUSINESS OPTIMIZATION CHARGES

Infusion
    Pump Charges

In July 2005, the company stopped shipment of COLLEAGUE infusion
    pumps in the United States. Following a number of Class I
    recalls relating to the performance of the pumps, as well as the
    seizure litigation described in Note 11, the company
    entered into a Consent Decree with the U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) in June 2006. Additional Class I
    recalls related to remediation and repair and maintenance
    activities were addressed by the company in 2007 and 2009.

On July 13, 2010, the FDA issued a final order requiring
    the company to recall its approximately 200,000 COLLEAGUE
    infusion pumps currently in use in the U.S. market.
    Pursuant to the terms of the order, Baxter is offering
    replacement infusion pumps or monetary consideration to owners
    of COLLEAGUE pumps and is executing the recall through
    July 13, 2012. Under the replacement option, customers may
    receive SIGMA Spectrum infusion pumps in exchange for COLLEAGUE
    infusion pumps.

In 2010, following the FDA’s issuance of its initial order
    dated April 30, 2010, the company recorded a charge of
    $588 million in connection with this recall and other
    actions the company is undertaking outside of the United States.
    Included in the charge were $142 million relating to asset
    impairments and $446 million for cash costs. The asset
    impairments principally related to inventory, lease receivables
    and other assets relating to the recalled pumps. The reserve for
    cash costs included an estimate of cash refunds or replacement
    infusion pumps that are being offered to current owners in
    exchange for their COLLEAGUE infusion pumps. Cash costs also
    included costs associated with the execution of the recall
    program and customer accommodations. It is possible that
    substantial additional cash and non-cash charges may be required
    in future periods based on new information, changes in
    estimates, the implementation of the recall in the United
    States, and other actions the company may be required to
    undertake in markets outside the United States.

Of the total charge, $213 million was recorded as a
    reduction of net sales and $375 million was recorded in
    cost of sales. The amount recorded in net sales principally
    related to estimated cash payments to customers.

Prior to the charge recorded in 2010, from 2005 through 2009,
    the company recorded charges and other costs totaling
    $337 million related to its COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion
    pumps. In aggregate, these charges included $270 million of
    cash costs and $67 million principally related to asset
    impairments. These reserves for cash costs related to estimated
    expenditures for the materials, labor and freight costs expected
    to be incurred to remediate the design issues, customer
    accommodations, and additional warranty and other commitments
    made to customers.

While the company continues to work to resolve the issues
    associated with COLLEAGUE infusion pumps globally, there can be
    no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal
    penalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory
    actions with respect to the company will not occur, that the
    company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers
    or users, that substantial additional charges or significant
    asset


impairments may not be required, that sales of other products
    may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation
    will not be introduced that may adversely affect the
    company’s operations and consolidated financial statements.

The following table summarizes cash activity in the
    company’s COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion pump reserves
    through December 31, 2010.

Business
    Optimization Charges

In 2010 and 2009, the company recorded charges of
    $257 million and $79 million, respectively, primarily
    related to costs associated with optimizing its overall cost
    structure on a global basis, as the company streamlines its
    international operations, rationalizes its manufacturing
    facilities and enhances its general and administrative
    infrastructure. The charges included severance costs, as well as
    asset impairments and contract terminations associated with
    discontinued products and projects, the terminations of which
    will not have a material impact on the company’s future
    results of operations.

Included in the 2010 and 2009 charges were cash costs of
    $184 million and $69 million, respectively,
    principally pertaining to severance and other employee-related
    costs in Europe and the United States.

Also included in the charges were asset impairments relating to
    fixed assets, inventory and other assets associated with
    discontinued products and projects. These other costs totaled
    $73 million and $10 million in 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

Of the total 2010 charge, $132 million was recorded in cost
    of sales and $125 million was recorded in marketing and
    administrative expenses. Of the total 2009 charge,
    $30 million was recorded in cost of sales and
    $49 million was recorded in marketing and administrative
    expenses. The charges were recorded at the corporate level and
    were not allocated to a segment.

    2010 and $29 million at December 31, 2009.

Significant
    Debt Issuances

In March 2010, the company issued $600 million of senior
    unsecured notes, with $300 million maturing in March 2013
    and bearing a 1.8% coupon rate, and $300 million maturing
    in March 2020 and bearing a 4.25% coupon rate. In February 2009,
    the company issued $350 million of senior unsecured notes,
    maturing in March


2014 and bearing a 4.0% coupon rate. In August 2009, the company
    issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes, maturing in
    August 2019 and bearing a 4.5% coupon rate. In May 2008, the
    company issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes,
    maturing in June 2018 and bearing a 5.375% coupon rate. The
    notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the company’s
    option, subject to a make-whole redemption premium. In addition,
    during 2008, the company issued commercial paper, of which
    $200 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2008,
    with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.55%. There was no
    commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2010 and
    2009.

The net proceeds of the debt issuances noted above were used for
    general corporate purposes, including the repayment of
    $200 million of outstanding commercial paper in 2009 and
    for the settlement of cross-currency swaps in 2008. See
    Note 7 for further information regarding the settlement of
    net investment hedges. The debt instruments include certain
    covenants, including restrictions relating to the company’s
    creation of secured debt.

Credit
    Facilities

The company had $2.7 billion of cash and equivalents at
    December 31, 2010. The company’s primary revolving
    credit facility has a maximum capacity of $1.5 billion and
    matures in December 2011. The company also maintains a
    Euro-denominated credit facility with a maximum capacity of
    approximately $400 million at December 31, 2010, which
    matures in January 2013. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities. As
    of December 31, 2008, there was $164 million
    outstanding under the Euro-denominated facility, which was
    repaid in 2009. The company’s facilities enable the company
    to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest
    rates, and contain various covenants, including a maximum
    net-debt-to-capital ratio. At December 31, 2010, the
    company was in compliance with the financial covenants in these
    agreements. The non-performance of any financial institution
    supporting either of the credit facilities would reduce the
    maximum capacity of these facilities by each institution’s
    respective commitment.

The company also maintains other credit arrangements, which
    totaled $272 million at December 31, 2010 and
    $454 million at December 31, 2009. Borrowings
    outstanding under these facilities totaled $15 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $29 million at December 31,
    2009.

Leases

The company leases certain facilities and equipment under
    capital and operating leases expiring at various dates. The
    leases generally provide for the company to pay taxes,
    maintenance, insurance and certain other operating costs of the
    leased property. Most of the operating leases contain renewal
    options. Operating lease rent expense was $184 million in
    2010, $172 million in 2009 and $161 million in 2008.


Collaborative
    Arrangements

In the normal course of business, Baxter enters into
    collaborative arrangements with third parties. Certain of these
    collaborative arrangements include joint operating activities
    involving active participation by both partners, where both
    Baxter and the other entity are exposed to risks and rewards
    dependent on the commercial success of the activity. These
    collaborative arrangements exist in all three of the
    company’s segments, take a number of forms and structures,
    principally pertain to the joint development and
    commercialization of new products, and are designed to enhance
    and expedite long-term sales and profitability growth.

The collaborative arrangements can broadly be grouped into two
    categories: those relating to new product development, and those
    relating to existing commercial products.

New
    Product Development Arrangements

The company’s joint new product development and
    commercialization arrangements generally provide that Baxter
    license certain rights to manufacture, market or distribute a
    specified technology or product under development. Baxter’s
    consideration for the rights generally consists of some
    combination of up-front payments, ongoing R&D cost
    reimbursements, royalties, and contingent payments relating to
    the achievement of specified pre-clinical, clinical, regulatory
    approval or sales milestones. Joint steering committees often
    exist to manage the various stages and activities of the
    arrangement. Control over the R&D activities may be shared
    or may be performed by Baxter. Baxter generally controls the
    commercialization phase, sometimes purchasing raw materials from
    the collaboration partner.

During the development phase, Baxter’s R&D costs are
    expensed as incurred. These costs may include R&D cost
    reimbursements to the partner, as well as up-front and milestone
    payments to the partner prior to the date the product receives
    regulatory approval. Milestone payments made to the partner
    subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as other
    intangible assets and amortized to cost of sales over the
    estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalty payments are
    expensed as cost of sales when they become due and payable. Any
    purchases of raw materials from the partner during the
    development stage are expensed as R&D, while such purchases
    during the commercialization phase are capitalized as inventory
    and recognized as cost of sales when the related finished
    products are sold. Baxter generally records the amount invoiced
    to the third-party customer for the finished product as sales,
    as Baxter is the principal and primary obligor in the
    arrangement.

Payments to collaborative partners classified in cost of sales
    were not significant in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Payments to
    collaborative partners classified in R&D expense were 6%,
    6% and 7% of total R&D expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The payments principally related to the
    development of tissue repair products, longer-acting forms of
    blood clotting proteins to treat hemophilia and a home
    hemodialysis device.

Commercial
    Product Arrangements

The company’s commercial product collaborative arrangements
    generally provide for a sharing of manufacturing, marketing or
    distribution activities between Baxter and the partner, along
    with a sharing of the related profits. The nature and split of
    the shared activities varies, sometimes split by type of
    activity and sometimes split by geographic area.

The entity that invoices the third-party customer is generally
    the principal and primary obligor in the arrangement and
    therefore records the invoiced amount as a sale. Cost-sharing
    payments are generally recorded in cost of sales. Baxter’s
    payments to partners under these types of arrangements were less
    than 1% of total cost of sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Other
    Commitments and Contingencies

Joint
    Development and Commercialization Arrangements

In addition to the new product development arrangements
    discussed above, the company has entered into certain other
    arrangements which include contingent milestone payments. At
    December 31, 2010, the company’s unfunded milestone
    payments associated with all of its arrangements totaled
    $960 million. This total excludes any contingent royalties.
    Based on the company’s projections, any contingent payments
    made in the future will be more than offset over time by the
    estimated net future cash flows relating to the rights


acquired for those payments. The majority of the contingent
    payments relate to arrangements in the BioScience segment.
    Included in the total are contingent milestone payments related
    to the Archemix hemophilia-related asset agreement discussed in
    Note 4, as well as significant collaborations related to
    the development of hard and soft tissue-repair products to
    position the company to enter the orthobiologic market, and the
    development of longer-acting forms of blood clotting proteins to
    treat hemophilia A.

Indemnifications

During the normal course of business, Baxter makes indemnities,
    commitments and guarantees pursuant to which the company may be
    required to make payments related to specific transactions.
    Indemnifications include: (i) intellectual property
    indemnities to customers in connection with the use, sales or
    license of products and services; (ii) indemnities to
    customers in connection with losses incurred while performing
    services on their premises; (iii) indemnities to vendors
    and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence
    or willful misconduct; and (iv) indemnities involving the
    representations and warranties in certain contracts. In
    addition, under Baxter’s Amended and Restated Certificate
    of Incorporation, and consistent with Delaware General
    Corporation Law, the company has agreed to indemnify its
    directors and officers for certain losses and expenses upon the
    occurrence of certain prescribed events. The majority of these
    indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any
    limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that the
    company could be obligated to make. To help address some of
    these risks, the company maintains various insurance coverages.
    Based on historical experience and evaluation of the agreements,
    the company does not believe that any significant payments
    related to its indemnifications will result, and therefore the
    company has not recorded any associated liabilities.

Legal
    Contingencies

Refer to Note 11 for a discussion of the company’s
    legal contingencies.

NOTE 7

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED FAIR VALUE
    MEASUREMENTS

Receivable
    Securitizations

For trade receivables originated in Japan, the company has
    entered into agreements with financial institutions in which the
    entire interest in and ownership of the receivable is sold. The
    company continues to service the receivables in its Japanese
    securitization arrangement. Servicing assets or liabilities are
    not recognized because the company receives adequate
    compensation to service the sold receivables. The Japanese
    securitization arrangement includes limited recourse provisions,
    which are not material.

The following is a summary of the activity relating to the
    securitization arrangement.

The net gains and losses relating to the sales of receivables

Concentrations
    of Risk

The company invests excess cash in certificates of deposit or
    money market funds and diversifies the concentration of cash
    among different financial institutions. With respect to
    financial instruments, where appropriate, the company has
    diversified its selection of counterparties, and has arranged
    collateralization and

master-netting

agreements to minimize the risk of loss.


The company continues to do business with foreign governments in
    certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy,
    that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic
    conditions. While the economic downturn has not significantly
    impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables,
    global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain
    countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays
    in the collection of receivables and credit losses. In 2010, the
    company recorded a charge of $28 million to write down its
    accounts receivable in Greece principally as a result of the
    Greek government’s plan to convert certain past due
    receivables into non-interest bearing bonds with maturities of
    one to three years. Refer to Note 1 for further information
    regarding this charge. Global economic conditions and
    customer-specific factors may require the company to

re-evaluate

the collectibility of its receivables and the company could
    potentially incur additional charges.

Foreign
    Currency and Interest Rate Risk Management

The company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely
    impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
    The company’s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks
    to an acceptable level based on the company’s judgment of
    the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs.

The company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with
    respect to recognized assets and liabilities, forecasted
    transactions and net assets denominated in the Euro, Japanese
    Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar,
    Brazilian Real and Colombian Peso. The company manages its
    foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows
    the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural
    offsets. In addition, the company uses derivative and
    nonderivative instruments to further reduce the net exposure to
    foreign exchange. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments
    offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce
    the earnings and equity volatility resulting from foreign
    exchange. Financial market and currency volatility may reduce
    the benefits of the company’s natural hedges and limit the
    company’s ability to cost-effectively hedge these exposures.

The company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and
    cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in
    interest rates. The company’s policy is to manage interest
    costs using a mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt that the
    company believes is appropriate. To manage this mix in a
    cost-efficient manner, the company periodically enters into
    interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at
    specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating
    interest amounts calculated by reference to an

agreed-upon

notional amount.

The company does not hold any instruments for trading purposes
    and none of the company’s outstanding derivative
    instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

The company may use options, including collars and purchased
    options, forwards and cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign
    exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions
    and recognized assets and liabilities. The company periodically
    uses forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate
    locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with movements in
    interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of debt.
    Certain other firm commitments and forecasted transactions are
    also periodically hedged. Cash flow hedges primarily related to
    forecasted intercompany sales denominated in foreign currencies,
    a hedge of U.S. Dollar-denominated debt issued by a foreign
    subsidiary and anticipated issuances of debt.

The notional amounts of foreign exchange contracts were
    $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31,
    2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The notional
    amount of cross-currency swaps (used to hedge
    U.S. Dollar-denominated debt issued by a foreign
    subsidiary) was $500 million as of December 31, 2009.
    In 2010, in conjunction with the maturity of $500 million
    of U.S. Dollar-denominated debt held by a foreign
    subsidiary, the company terminated related cross-currency swaps.
    The cash outflow resulting from this termination was
    $45 million, which was reported in the financing section of
    the consolidated statements of cash flows. The notional amount
    of interest rate contracts outstanding as of December 31,
    2009 was $200 million. In the first quarter of 2010, in
    conjunction with the 2010 debt issuance disclosed in
    Note 6,


these contracts were terminated, resulting in a gain of
    $18 million that is being amortized to net interest expense
    over the life of the related debt.

The maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge
    contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at
    December 31, 2010 is 18 months.

Fair
    Value Hedges

The company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its
    fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. These instruments hedge
    the company’s earnings from changes in the fair value of
    debt due to fluctuations in the designated benchmark interest
    rate.

The total notional amount of interest rate contracts designated
    as fair value hedges was $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion
    as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Dedesignations

In 2009, the company terminated $500 million of its
    interest rate contracts, resulting in a net gain of
    $10 million that was deferred in AOCI. There were no hedge
    dedesignations in 2010, 2009 or 2008 resulting from changes in
    the company’s assessment of the probability that the hedged
    forecasted transactions would occur.

Undesignated
    Derivative Instruments

The company uses forward contracts to hedge earnings from the
    effects of foreign exchange relating to certain of the
    company’s intercompany and third-party receivables and
    payables denominated in a foreign currency. These derivative
    instruments are generally not formally designated as hedges and
    the terms of these instruments generally do not exceed one month.

The total notional amount of undesignated derivative instruments
    was $445 million and $419 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Gains and
    Losses on Derivative Instruments

Hedges of
    Net Investments in Foreign Operations

In 2008, the company terminated its remaining net investment
    hedge portfolio and no longer has any outstanding net investment
    hedges. Of the $528 million of net settlement payments in
    2008, $540 million of cash outflows were included as
    payments of obligations in the financing section and
    $12 million of cash inflows were included in the operating
    section of the consolidated statement of cash flows. The net
    after-tax losses related to net investment hedge instruments
    recorded in OCI were $33 million in 2008.

Fair
    Value Measurements

The fair value hierarchy under the accounting standard for fair
    value measurements consists of the following three levels:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets that
    the company has the ability to access for identical assets or
    liabilities;

•

Level 2 — Quoted prices for similar instruments
    in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
    instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based
    valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the
    market; and

•

Level 3 — Valuations using significant inputs
    that are unobservable in the market and include the use of
    judgment by the company’s management about the assumptions
    market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The following tables summarize the bases used to measure
    financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value
    on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets.

For assets that are measured using quoted prices in active
    markets, the fair value is the published market price per unit
    multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of
    transaction costs. The majority of the derivatives entered into
    by the company are valued using internal valuation techniques as
    no quoted market prices exist for such instruments. The
    principal techniques used to value these instruments are
    discounted cash flow and Black-Scholes models. The key inputs
    are considered observable and vary depending on the type of
    derivative, and include contractual terms, interest rate yield
    curves, foreign exchange rates and volatility. The contingent
    payments are valued using a discounted cash flow technique that
    reflects management’s expectations about probability of
    payment.

Refer to Note 4 for further information regarding changes
    in fair value of the contingent payments related to acquisitions
    and investments. Refer to Note 9 for fair value disclosures
    related to the company’s pension plans.

The following table is a reconciliation of the fair value
    measurements that use significant unobservable inputs
    (Level 3), which consist of contingent payments related to
    acquisitions and investments.

The unrealized loss recognized in earnings relates to
    liabilities held at December 31, 2010 and is reported in
    cost of sales and R&D expense. The additions during 2010
    principally relate to the fair value of contingent payments
    associated with the company’s acquisition of ApaTech. Refer
    to Note 4 for more information regarding ApaTech.

As discussed further in Note 5, the company recorded asset
    impairment charges related to its COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion
    pumps in 2010, 2009 and 2008, and its business optimization
    initiatives in 2010 and 2009. Also, as further discussed in
    Note 2, the company recorded asset impairment charges
    associated with its SOLOMIX drug delivery system in 2009 and its
    CLEARSHOT pre-filled syringe program in 2008. As the assets had
    no alternative use and no salvage value, the fair values,
    measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3),
    were assessed to be zero.


Book
    Values and Fair Values of Financial Instruments

In addition to the financial instruments that the company is
    required to recognize at fair value on the consolidated balance
    sheets, the company has certain financial instruments that are
    recognized at historical cost or some basis other than fair
    value. For these financial instruments, the following table
    provides the values recognized on the consolidated balance
    sheets and the approximate fair values.

Long-term litigation liabilities





The estimated fair values of insurance receivables and long-term
    litigation liabilities were computed by discounting the expected
    cash flows based on currently available information, which in
    many cases does not include final orders or settlement
    agreements. The discount factors used in the calculations
    reflect the non-performance risk of the insurance providers and
    the company, respectively. The estimated fair values of current
    and long-term debt were computed by multiplying price by the
    notional amount of the respective debt instrument. Price is
    calculated using the stated terms of the respective debt
    instrument and yield curves commensurate with the company’s
    credit risk. In determining the fair value of cost method
    investments, the company takes into consideration recent
    transactions, as well as the financial information of the
    investee. The carrying values of the other financial instruments
    approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities
    of most of these assets and liabilities.

NOTE 8

COMMON STOCK

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The company’s stock-based compensation generally includes
    stock options, performance share units (PSUs), restricted stock
    units (RSUs) and purchases under employee stock purchase plans.
    Shares issued relating to the company’s stock-based plans
    are generally issued out of treasury stock. As of
    December 31, 2010, approximately 18 million authorized
    shares are available for future awards under the company’s
    stock-based compensation plans.

Stock
    Compensation Expense

Stock compensation expense recognized in the consolidated
    statements of income was $120 million, $140 million
    and $146 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    related tax benefit recognized was $36 million,
    $40 million and $46 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Stock compensation expense is recorded at the corporate level
    and is not allocated to a segment. Approximately 70% of stock
    compensation expense is classified in marketing and
    administrative expenses, with the remainder classified in cost
    of sales and R&D expenses. Costs capitalized in the
    consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010 were not
    significant.

Stock compensation expense is based on awards expected to vest,
    and therefore has been reduced by estimated forfeitures.
    Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised in
    subsequent periods, if necessary, if actual forfeitures differ
    from those estimates.


Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to employees and non-employee
    directors with exercise prices at least equal to 100% of the
    market value on the date of grant. Stock options generally vest
    in one-third increments over a three-year period. Stock options
    granted to non-employee directors generally cliff-vest 100% one
    year from the grant date. Stock options typically have a
    contractual term of 10 years. The grant-date fair value,
    adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense on
    a straight-line basis over the substantive vesting period.

The fair value of stock options is determined using the
    Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average assumptions used in
    estimating the fair value of stock options granted during each
    year, along with the weighted-average grant-date fair values,
    were as follows.

The company’s expected volatility assumption is based on an
    equal weighting of the historical volatility of Baxter’s
    stock and the implied volatility from traded options on
    Baxter’s stock. The expected life assumption is primarily
    based on the vesting terms of the stock option, historical
    employee exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination
    behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected life of
    the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
    effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield reflects
    historical experience as well as future expectations over the
    expected life of the option.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the

    closing stock price on the last trading day of the year. The
    total intrinsic value of options exercised was
    $110 million, $108 million and $328 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, $72 million of unrecognized
    compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be
    recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of
    approximately 1.7 years.

PSUs

The company’s annual equity awards stock compensation
    program for senior management includes the issuance of PSUs with
    market-based conditions. The company’s overall mix of
    annual stock compensation awards for senior management is
    approximately 50% stock options and 50% PSUs.


The payout resulting from the vesting of the PSUs is based on
    Baxter’s growth in shareholder value versus the growth in
    shareholder value of the healthcare companies in Baxter’s
    peer group during the three-year performance period commencing
    with the year in which the PSUs are granted. Depending on
    Baxter’s growth in shareholder value relative to the peer
    group, a holder of PSUs is entitled to receive a number of
    shares of common stock equal to a percentage, ranging from 0% to
    200%, of the PSUs granted. The grant-date fair value, adjusted
    for estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense on a
    straight-line basis over the substantive vesting period.

The fair value of PSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo model.
    A Monte Carlo model uses stock price volatility and other
    variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the market
    conditions and the resulting fair value of the award. The
    assumptions used in estimating the fair value of PSUs granted
    during each year, along with the weighted-average grant-date
    fair values, were as follows.

    in one-third increments over a three-year period. The company
    also annually grants RSUs to non-employee directors. These
    awards vest one year from the grant date. The grant-date fair
    value, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is recognized as
    expense on a straight-line basis over the substantive vesting
    period. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number
    of shares granted and the quoted price of the company’s
    common stock on the date of grant.

    respectively. The fair value of RSUs and restricted stock vested
    in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $9 million, $19 million and
    $34 million, respectively.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plans

Nearly all employees are eligible to participate in the
    company’s employee stock purchase plans. For subscriptions
    beginning on or after January 1, 2008, the employee
    purchase price is 85% of the closing market price on the
    purchase date.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the company issued approximately
    1.0 million, 875,000 and 727,000 shares, respectively,
    under employee stock purchase plans. The number of shares under
    subscription at December 31, 2010 totaled approximately
    1.1 million.

Realized
    Excess Income Tax Benefits and the Impact on the Statement of
    Cash Flows

Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock compensation
    are presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as an
    outflow within the operating section and an inflow within the
    financing section. Realized excess tax benefits from stock-based
    compensation were $41 million, $96 million and
    $112 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Stock
    Repurchase Programs

As authorized by the board of directors, the company repurchases
    its stock from time to time depending on the company’s cash
    flows, net debt level and market conditions. The company
    purchased 30 million shares for $1.5 billion in 2010,
    23 million shares for $1.2 billion in 2009 and
    32 million shares for $2.0 billion in 2008. In March
    2008, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to
    $2.0 billion of the company’s common stock. There is
    no remaining availability under the March 2008 authorization as
    of December 31, 2010. In July 2009, the board of directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of the
    company’s common stock. At December 31, 2010,
    approximately $500 million remained available under the
    July 2009 authorization. In December 2010, the board of
    directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional
    $2.5 billion of the company’s common stock. No shares
    had been repurchased under this authorization as of
    December 31, 2010.

Cash
    Dividends

In November 2008, the board of directors declared a quarterly
    dividend of $0.26 per share ($1.04 per share on an annualized
    basis), representing an increase of 20% over the previous
    quarterly rate. In November 2009, the board of directors
    declared a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share ($1.16 per
    share on an annualized basis), representing an increase of 12%
    over the previous quarterly rate. In November 2010, the board of
    directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share
    ($1.24 per share on an annualized basis), which was paid on
    January 5, 2011 to shareholders of record as of
    December 10, 2010. The dividend represented an increase of
    7% over the previous quarterly rate of $0.29 per share.

NOTE 9

RETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFIT PROGRAMS

The company sponsors a number of qualified and nonqualified
    pension plans for eligible employees. The company also sponsors
    certain unfunded contributory healthcare and life insurance
    benefits for substantially all domestic retired employees. Newly
    hired employees in the United States and Puerto Rico are not
    eligible to participate in the pension plans but receive a
    higher level of company contributions in the defined
    contribution plans.

As required by a new accounting standard, on December 31,
    2008, the company changed the measurement date for its defined
    benefit pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans
    from September 30 to December 31, the company’s fiscal
    year-end. The company elected to use the

15-month

remeasurement


approach, whereby a

net-of-tax

decrease to retained earnings of $27 million was recognized
    on December 31, 2008 equal to three-fifteenths of the net
    cost determined for the period from September 30, 2007 to
    December 31, 2008. The adjustment resulted in a

net-of-tax

increase to AOCI of $12 million. The remaining
    twelve-fifteenths of the net cost was recognized as expense in
    2008 as part of the net periodic benefit cost.

Accumulated
    Benefit Obligation Information

The pension obligation information in the table above represents
    the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The PBO incorporates
    assumptions relating to future compensation levels. The
    accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the same as the PBO
    except that it includes no assumptions relating to future
    compensation levels. The ABO for all of the company’s
    pension plans was $4.1 billion and $3.6 billion at the
    2010 and 2009 measurement dates, respectively.


The information in the funded status table above represents the
    totals for all of the company’s pension plans. The
    following is information relating to the individual plans in the
    funded status table above that have an ABO in excess of plan

    approximately $53 million of expected federal subsidies
    relating to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
    Modernization Act, including $3 million, $4 million,
    $4 million, $5 million and $5 million in each of

The company establishes the expected return on plan assets
    assumption primarily based on a review of historical compound
    average asset returns, both company-specific and relating to the
    broad market (based on the company’s asset allocation), as
    well as an analysis of current market and economic information
    and future expectations. The company plans to use an 8.25%
    assumption for its U.S. and Puerto Rico plans for 2011.

Pension
    Plan Assets

An investment committee of members of senior management is
    responsible for supervising, monitoring and evaluating the
    invested assets of the company’s funded pension plans. The
    investment committee, which meets


at least quarterly, abides by documented policies and procedures
    relating to investment goals, targeted asset allocations, risk
    management practices, allowable and prohibited investment
    holdings, diversification, use of derivatives, the relationship
    between plan assets and benefit obligations, and other relevant
    factors and considerations.

The investment committee’s documented policies and
    procedures include the following:

•

Ability to pay all benefits when due;

•

Targeted long-term performance expectations relative to
    applicable market indices, such as Standard &
    Poor’s, Russell, MSCI EAFE, and other indices;

•

Targeted asset allocation percentage ranges (summarized below),
    and periodic reviews of these allocations;

•

Diversification of assets among third-party investment managers,
    and by geography, industry, stage of business cycle and other
    measures;

•

Specified investment holding and transaction prohibitions (for
    example, private placements or other restricted securities,
    securities that are not traded in a sufficiently active market,
    short sales, certain derivatives, commodities and margin
    transactions);

•

Specified portfolio percentage limits on holdings in a single
    corporate or other entity (generally 5%, except for holdings in
    U.S. government or agency securities);

•

Specified average credit quality for the fixed-income securities
    portfolio (at least A- by Standard & Poor’s or A3
    by Moody’s);

•

Specified portfolio percentage limits on foreign
    holdings; and

•

Periodic monitoring of investment manager performance and
    adherence to the investment committee’s policies.

Plan assets are invested using a total return investment
    approach whereby a mix of equity securities, debt securities and
    other investments are used to preserve asset values, diversify
    risk and exceed the planned benchmark investment return.
    Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on
    consideration of plan liabilities, the plans’ funded status
    and other factors, such as the plans’ demographics and
    liability durations. Investment performance is reviewed by the
    investment committee on a quarterly basis and asset allocations
    are reviewed at least annually.

Plan assets are managed in a balanced portfolio comprised of two
    major components: equity securities and fixed income securities.
    The target allocations for plan assets are 60 percent in
    equity securities and 40 percent in fixed income securities
    and other holdings. The documented policy includes an allocation
    range based on each individual investment type within the major
    components that allows for a variance from the target
    allocations of approximately 10 percentage points. Equity
    securities primarily include common stock of U.S. and
    international companies, common/collective trust funds, mutual
    funds, and partnership investments. Fixed income securities and
    other holdings primarily include cash, money market funds with
    an original maturity of three months or less, U.S. and
    foreign government and governmental agency issues, corporate
    bonds, municipal securities, derivative contracts and
    asset-backed securities.

The assets and liabilities of the company’s pension plans
    are valued using the following valuation methods:

Investment category

Valuation methodology

Cash and cash equivalents

Values are based on cost, including the effects of foreign
    currency, which approximates fair value

U.S. government and government agency issues

Values are based on reputable pricing vendors, who typically use
    pricing matrices or models that use observable inputs

Corporate bonds

Values are based on reputable pricing vendors, who typically use
    pricing matrices or models that use observable inputs

Common stock

Values are based on the closing prices on the valuation date in
    an active market on national and international stock exchanges

Mutual funds

Values are based on the net asset value of the units held in the
    respective fund which are obtained from national and
    international exchanges or based on the net asset value of the
    underlying assets of the fund provided by the fund manager

Common/collective trust funds

Values are based on the net asset value of the units held at
    year end

Partnership investments

Values are based on the estimated fair value of the
    participation by the company in the investment as determined by
    the general partner or investment manager of the respective
    partnership

Other holdings

The value of these assets vary by investment type, but primarily
    are determined by reputable pricing vendors, who use pricing
    matrices or models that use observable inputs

Collateral held on loaned securities

Values are based on the net asset value per unit of the fund in
    which the collateral is invested

Collateral to be paid on loaned securities

Values are based on the fair value of the underlying securities
    loaned on the valuation date

Expected
    Pension and OPEB Plan Funding

The company’s funding policy for its pension plans is to
    contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding
    requirements, plus any additional amounts that the company may
    determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the
    plans, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the
    company, and other factors. Volatility in the global financial
    markets could have an unfavorable impact on future funding
    requirements. The company has no obligation to fund its
    principal plans in the United States and Puerto Rico in 2011.
    The company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any
    discretionary contributions. The company expects to make cash
    contributions to its pension plans of at least $214 million
    in 2011, which includes a $150 million discretionary cash
    contribution made to its pension plan in the United States in
    January 2011. The company expects to have net cash outflows
    relating to its OPEB plan of approximately $25 million in
    2011.

The table below details the funded status percentage of the
    company’s pension plans as of December 31, 2010,
    including certain plans that are unfunded in accordance with the
    guidelines of the company’s funding policy outlined above.
    The table excludes the $150 million discretionary cash
    contribution made to the pension plan in the United States in
    January 2011.

At December 31, 2010, the company had U.S. operating
    loss carryforwards totaling $21 million and foreign tax
    credit carryforwards totaling $80 million. The operating
    loss carryforwards expire between 2011 and 2021. The foreign tax
    credits expire in 2018. At December 31, 2010, the company
    had foreign net operating loss carryforwards totaling
    $437 million. Of this amount, $1 million expires in
    2011, $4 million expires in 2012, $9 million expires
    in 2013, $11 million expires in 2014, $12 million
    expires in 2015, $1 million expires in 2016,
    $37 million expires after 2016 and $362 million has no
    expiration date. Realization of these operating loss and tax
    credit carryforwards depends on generating sufficient taxable
    income in future periods. A valuation allowance of
    $118 million and $144 million was recorded at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, to reduce the
    deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax
    credit carryforwards, because the company does not believe it is
    more likely than not that these assets will be fully realized
    prior to expiration. The company will continue to evaluate the
    need for additional valuation allowances and, as circumstances
    change, the valuation allowance may change.

$


The company recognized income tax expense of $93 million
    during 2010 relating to 2010 and prior earnings outside the
    United States that are not deemed indefinitely reinvested, of
    which $38 million related to earnings from years prior to
    2010. The company continues to evaluate whether to indefinitely
    reinvest earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions as it
    continues to analyze the company’s global financial
    structure. Currently, management intends to continue to reinvest
    past earnings in several jurisdictions outside of the United
    States indefinitely, and therefore has not recognized
    U.S. income tax expense on these earnings.
    U.S. federal and state income taxes, net of applicable
    credits, on these foreign unremitted earnings of
    $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2010 would be
    approximately $2.4 billion. As of December 31, 2009
    the foreign unremitted earnings and U.S. federal and state
    income tax amounts were $6.8 billion and $2.1 billion,
    respectively.

Effective
    Income Tax Rate

The effective income tax rate was 25% in 2010, 19% in 2009 and
    18% in 2008. As detailed in the income tax expense
    reconciliation table above, the company’s effective tax
    rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year
    due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives,
    state and local taxes, and foreign taxes that are different than
    the U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition, the effective
    tax rate can be impacted each period by discrete factors and
    events. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2010 was
    principally due to a $588 million charge related to the
    recall of COLLEAGUE infusion pumps from the U.S. market for
    which there was no net tax benefit recognized, a
    $39 million write-off of a deferred tax asset as a result
    of a change in the tax treatment of reimbursements under the
    Medicare Part D retiree prescription drug subsidy program
    under healthcare reform legislation enacted in the United
    States, a charge related to contingent tax matters, and
    $34 million of IPR&D charges for which the tax benefit
    was lower than the U.S. statutory rate. These items were
    partially offset by the tax benefits from the U.S. generic
    injectables business impairment charge, the business
    optimization charge and a charge related to litigation
    associated with the company’s 2008


recall of its heparin sodium injection products in the United
    States, in addition to a change in the earnings mix from higher
    tax to lower tax rate jurisdictions compared to the prior year
    period. The effective tax rate for 2009 was impacted by greater
    income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates, partially offset
    by $51 million of income tax benefit from the use of
    foreign tax losses.

Unrecognized
    Tax Benefits

The company classifies interest and penalties associated with
    income taxes in the income tax expense line in the consolidated
    statements of income. Interest and penalties recorded during
    2010, 2009 and 2008 were not material. The liability recorded at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 related to interest and
    penalties was $49 million and $41 million,
    respectively.

The following is a reconciliation of the company’s
    unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008.

Of the gross unrecognized tax benefits, $432 million and
    $396 million were recognized as liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively.

None of the positions included in the liability for uncertain
    tax positions related to tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Also, the
    reduction of the unrecognized tax benefits in each year did not
    significantly affect the company’s effective tax rate.

Tax
    Incentives

The company has received tax incentives in Puerto Rico,
    Switzerland, and certain other taxing jurisdictions outside the
    United States. The financial impact of the reductions as
    compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate is indicated in
    the income tax expense reconciliation table above. The tax
    reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably
    impacted earnings per diluted share by $0.51 in 2010, $0.50 in
    2009 and $0.45 in 2008. The Puerto Rico grant provides that the
    company’s manufacturing operations will be partially exempt
    from local taxes until the year 2018. The Switzerland grant
    provides that the company’s manufacturing operations will
    be partially exempt from local taxes until the year 2017. The
    tax incentives in the other jurisdictions continue through at
    least 2011.

Examinations
    of Tax Returns

As of December 31, 2010, Baxter had ongoing audits in the
    United States, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom, as well
    as bilateral Advance Pricing Agreement proceedings that the
    company voluntarily initiated between the U.S. government
    and the government of Switzerland with respect to intellectual
    property, product, and service transfer pricing arrangements.
    Baxter expects to reduce the amount of its liability for
    uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months by
    approximately $280 million due principally to the
    resolution of certain multi-jurisdictional transfer pricing
    issues and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.
    While the final outcome of these matters is inherently
    uncertain, the company believes it has made adequate tax
    provisions for all years subject to examination.


NOTE 11

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Baxter is involved in product liability, patent, commercial, and
    other legal matters that arise in the normal course of the
    company’s business. The company records a liability when a
    loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably
    estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a
    range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the
    minimum amount in the range is accrued. If a loss is not
    probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no
    liability is recorded.

Baxter has established reserves for certain of the matters
    discussed below. The company is not able to estimate the amount
    or range of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for
    which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already
    reserved. While the liability of the company in connection with
    the claims cannot be estimated with any certainty and although
    the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these
    matters could have a significant impact on the company’s
    results of operations and cash flows for that period, the
    outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position. While the company believes that it has valid
    defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain,
    excessive verdicts do occur, and the company may incur material
    judgments or enter into material settlements of claims.

In addition to the matters described below, the company remains
    subject to other potential administrative and legal actions.
    With respect to governmental and regulatory matters, these
    actions may lead to product recalls, injunctions, and other
    restrictions on the company’s operations and monetary
    sanctions, including significant civil or criminal penalties.
    With respect to intellectual property, the company may be
    exposed to significant litigation concerning the scope of the
    company’s and others’ rights. Such litigation could
    result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market
    products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or
    otherwise materially affect future results of operations.

Patent
    Litigation

Sevoflurane
    Litigation

Since 2000, Baxter’s generic sevoflurane has been the
    subject of several patent infringement actions initiated by
    Abbott Laboratories and Central Glass Company. Both lawsuits in
    the United States were resolved in Baxter’s favor, the
    first in 2006 by the Court of Appeals for the Federal
    Circuit’s decision that the asserted patent was invalid;
    the second in 2009 by a ruling of the U.S.D.C for the Northern
    District of Illinois that Baxter’s product did not infringe
    a related patent. This later ruling was upheld on
    reconsideration in 2010 and was not appealed by Abbott or
    Central Glass. In 2009, a lawsuit filed in Japan alleging
    infringement of a counterpart Japanese patent was also resolved
    in Baxter’s favor by the appellate court’s
    non-infringement determination. A related action remains pending
    in Colombia.

Peritoneal
    Dialysis Litigation

In October 2006, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a direct
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Baxter, and DEKA Products Limited
    Partnership (DEKA) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against
    Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. and Fresenius USA, Inc.
    The complaint alleged that Fresenius’ sale of the Liberty
    Cycler peritoneal dialysis systems and related disposable items
    and equipment infringed nine U.S. patents, which are owned
    by Baxter or exclusively licensed in the peritoneal dialysis
    field to Baxter from DEKA. During the pendency of the
    litigation, Fresenius agreed to remove certain functionality
    from the Liberty Cycler and the parties agreed to stay or
    dismiss seven of the patents. In July 2010, a jury in the
    U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of California found that the
    remaining two patents were not infringed by Fresenius. In
    February 2011, the court denied Baxter’s post trial motions
    requesting that the verdict be overturned and a new trial be
    ordered.

Hemodialysis
    Litigation

Since April 2003, Baxter has been pursuing a patent infringement
    action against Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. for
    infringement of certain Baxter patents. The patents cover
    Fresenius’ 2008K hemodialysis instrument. In 2007, the
    court entered judgment in Baxter’s favor holding the
    patents valid and infringed, and


a jury assessed damages at $14 million for past sales only.
    In April 2008, the U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of
    California granted Baxter’s motion for permanent
    injunction, granted Baxter’s request for royalties on
    Fresenius’ sales of the 2008K hemodialysis machines during
    a nine-month transition period before the permanent injunction
    took effect, and granted a royalty on disposables. In September
    2009, the appellate court affirmed Fresenius’ liability for
    infringing valid claims of Baxter’s main patent,
    invalidated certain claims of other patents, and remanded the
    case to the district court to finalize the scope of the
    injunction and the amount of damages owed to Baxter. In November
    2009, the appellate court denied Fresenius’ petition for
    re-hearing of the appeal. In January 2010, Fresenius consented
    to reentry of the injunction and sought a new trial to determine
    royalties, which the company is opposing.

In March 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark
    Office’s (USPTO) appellate board affirmed the previous
    determination by the USPTO patent examiner that the remaining
    patent was invalid. The board denied a request for
    reconsideration and the company has appealed the USPTO’s
    decision to the same appellate court that affirmed the validity
    of the patent in September 2009. Fresenius has asked the trial
    court to stay further court proceedings during the pendency of
    the company’s appeal of the USPTO’s negative
    determination.

Product
    Liability Litigation

Heparin
    Litigation

In connection with the recall of heparin products in the United
    States, approximately 770 lawsuits have been filed alleging that
    plaintiffs suffered various reactions to a heparin contaminant,
    in some cases resulting in fatalities. In June 2008, a number of
    these federal cases were consolidated in the U.S.D.C. for the
    Northern District of Ohio for pretrial case management under the
    Multi District Litigation rules. In September 2008, a number of
    state court cases were consolidated in Cook County, Illinois for
    pretrial case management, with a scheduled trial date for the
    first of these cases in May 2011. Discovery is ongoing with
    respect to these matters.

Propofol
    Litigation

The company is a defendant, along with others, in numerous
    lawsuits filed in state court in Las Vegas, Nevada. These
    lawsuits allege that health care workers improperly reused vials
    of propofol during endoscopy procedures, which resulted in the
    transmission of Hepatitis C to patients. These lawsuits allege
    that Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) (as the manufacturer)
    and the company (as the distributor) improperly designed,
    manufactured and sold larger vials of propofol to these
    endoscopy centers. The first case went to trial against Teva and
    the company in April 2010. The jury awarded the plaintiffs
    $5 million in compensatory damages and $500 million in
    punitive damages ($356 million against Teva and
    $144 million against the company). Teva and the company
    have appealed this decision. Additionally, Baxter believes it is
    entitled to indemnity in these matters pursuant to an indemnity
    agreement entered into with Teva in 2009. The next trial is
    scheduled for April 2011.

Factor
    Concentrates Litigation

Baxter currently is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and
    subject to additional claims brought by individuals who have
    hemophilia and their families, all seeking damages for injuries
    allegedly caused by anti-hemophilic factor concentrates VIII or
    IX derived from human blood plasma (factor concentrates)
    processed by the company and other acquired entities from the
    late 1970s to the mid-1980s. The typical case or claim alleges
    that the individual was infected with the HIV or HCV virus by
    factor concentrates that contained one or both viruses. None of
    these cases involves factor concentrates currently processed by
    the company. The vast majority of these claims have been
    resolved.

Other

In October 2004, a purported class action was filed in the
    U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois against Baxter
    and its current Chief Executive Officer and then current Chief
    Financial Officer and their predecessors for alleged violations
    of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
    amended. Plaintiff alleges that these defendants, along with the
    Administrative and Investment Committees of the company’s
    401(k)


plans, breached their fiduciary duties to the plan participants
    by offering Baxter common stock as an investment option in each
    of the plans during the period of January 2001 to October 2004.
    In March 2006, the trial court certified a class of plan
    participants who elected to acquire Baxter common stock through
    the plans between January 2001 and the present. Summary judgment
    in the company’s favor was granted by the trial court in
    May 2010. The plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

In May 2010, a shareholder derivative action was brought on
    behalf of the company in the Circuit Court of Lake County,
    Illinois against the company’s board of directors, its
    Chief Executive Officer and its then current Chief Financial
    Officer and President of Medication Delivery. The complaint
    alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to
    the company and caused substantial damage to the company in
    connection with addressing the COLLEAGUE infusion pump matter.
    Since October 2010, four additional derivative actions have been
    filed on behalf of the company against the company’s board
    of directors and certain current and former executive officers
    in the U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois. In
    January 2011, the Lake County action was stayed at the request
    of the Federal Court plaintiffs. The complaints allege breach of
    fiduciary duties and substantial damage to the company arising
    from the manner in which the COLLEAGUE matter has been addressed
    under state law as well as in some cases violations of the
    federal securities laws. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for
    the company and corporate governance reform and attorneys’
    fees.

In September 2010, a purported class action was filed in the
    U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois against the
    company and certain of its current executive officers. The
    complaint alleges that, from September 17, 2009 to
    May 3, 2010, the defendants issued materially false and
    misleading statements regarding the company’s plasma-based
    therapies business and the company’s remediation of its
    COLLEAGUE infusion pumps causing the company’s common stock
    to trade at artificially high levels. A similar suit was filed
    against the company and certain of its executive officers in the
    U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois in November 2010.
    These suits seek to recover the lost value of investors’
    stock as damages. These suits have been consolidated for further
    proceedings.

In October 2005, the United States filed a complaint in the
    U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois to effect the
    seizure of COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion pumps that were on hold
    in Northern Illinois. Customer-owned pumps were not affected. In
    June 2006, Baxter Healthcare Corporation entered into a Consent
    Decree for Condemnation and Permanent Injunction with the United
    States to resolve this seizure litigation. Pursuant to the
    Consent Decree, on July 13, 2010 the FDA issued a final
    order regarding the recall of the company’s COLLEAGUE
    infusion pumps currently in use in the United States. The
    company is executing the recall through July 13, 2012 by
    offering its customers an option to replace their COLLEAGUE
    infusion pumps or receive monetary consideration. The company
    will permit lessees to terminate their leases without penalty
    and refund any prepaid, unused lease portion upon the return of
    the devices. Additional third-party claims may be filed in
    connection with the COLLEAGUE matter. In September 2009, the
    company received a subpoena from the Office of the United States
    Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois requesting
    production of documents relating to the COLLEAGUE infusion pump.
    The company is fully cooperating with the request.

The company is a defendant, along with others, in nineteen
    lawsuits brought in various U.S. federal courts alleging
    that Baxter and certain of its competitors conspired to restrict
    output and artificially increase the price of plasma-derived
    therapies since 2003. The complaints attempt to state a claim
    for class action relief and in some cases demand treble damages.
    These cases have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings
    before the U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois.

The company is a defendant, along with others, in less than a
    dozen lawsuits which allege that Baxter and other defendants
    manipulated product reimbursements by, among other things,
    reporting artificially inflated average wholesale prices (AWP)
    for Medicare and Medicaid eligible drugs. The cases have been
    consolidated for pretrial purposes before the U.S.D.C. for the
    District of Massachusetts. In April 2008, the court
    preliminarily approved a class settlement resolving Medicare
    Part B claims and independent health plan claims against
    Baxter and others, which had previously been reserved for by the
    company. Final approval of this settlement is expected in 2011.
    Baxter has also resolved a number of other AWP cases brought by
    state


attorneys general and other plaintiffs. A small number of
    lawsuits against Baxter brought by relators and state attorneys
    general remain which seek unspecified damages, injunctive
    relief, civil penalties, disgorgement, forfeiture and
    restitution.

The company has received a letter request from the Office of the
    United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
    to produce documents related to the company’s contracting,
    marketing and promotional, and historical government price
    reporting practices in the United States. In addition, the
    company received a request from the Office of the United States
    Attorney for the Northern District of California to produce
    documents related to the company’s marketing and
    promotional practices, including relationships between the
    company and specialty pharmacies. The company is fully
    cooperating with both of these requests.

The company has received an inquiry from the
    U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange
    Commission requesting that the company voluntarily provide
    information about its business activities in a number of
    countries. The company is fully cooperating with the agencies
    and understands that this inquiry is part of a broader review of
    industry practices for compliance with the U.S. Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act.

NOTE 12

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Baxter operates in three segments, each of which is a strategic
    business that is managed separately because each business
    develops, manufactures and markets distinct products and
    services. The segments and a description of their products and
    services are as follows:

The

BioScience

business processes recombinant and
    plasma-based proteins to treat hemophilia and other bleeding
    disorders; plasma-based therapies to treat immune deficiencies,
    alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, burns and shock, and other
    chronic and acute blood-related conditions; products for
    regenerative medicine, such as biosurgery products; and select
    vaccines.

The

Medication Delivery

business manufactures intravenous
    (IV) solutions and administration sets, premixed drugs and
    drug-reconstitution systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for
    injectable drugs, IV nutrition products, infusion pumps, and
    inhalation anesthetics. The business also provides products and
    services related to pharmacy compounding, drug formulation and
    packaging technologies. In October 2010, the company entered
    into an agreement to divest its U.S. generic injectables
    business. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding
    this divestiture.

The

Renal

business provides products to treat end-stage
    renal disease, or irreversible kidney failure. The business
    manufactures solutions and other products for peritoneal
    dialysis (PD), a home-based therapy, and also distributes
    products for hemodialysis, which is generally conducted in a
    hospital or clinic.

The company uses more than one measurement and multiple views of
    data to measure segment performance and to allocate resources to
    the segments. However, the dominant measurements are consistent
    with the company’s consolidated financial statements and,
    accordingly, are reported on the same basis in this report. The
    company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates
    resources to them primarily based on pre-tax income along with
    cash flows and overall economic returns. Intersegment sales are
    generally accounted for at amounts comparable to sales to
    unaffiliated customers, and are eliminated in consolidation. The
    accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies in Note 1.

Certain items are maintained at the corporate level (Corporate)
    and are not allocated to a segment. They primarily include most
    of the company’s debt and cash and equivalents and related
    net interest expense, certain foreign exchange fluctuations
    (principally relating to intercompany receivables, payables and
    loans denominated in a foreign currency) and the majority of the
    foreign currency hedging activities, corporate headquarters
    costs, stock compensation expense, certain non-strategic
    investments and related income and expense, certain employee
    benefit plan costs, certain nonrecurring gains and losses,
    certain IPR&D charges, certain other charges (such as
    Greece receivables and business optimization charges), deferred
    income taxes, certain litigation liabilities and related
    insurance receivables, and the revenues and costs related to the


manufacturing, distribution and other transition agreements with
    Fenwal. All of the company’s Other net sales in the table
    below relate to the agreements with Fenwal. With respect to
    depreciation and amortization and expenditures for long-lived
    assets, the difference between the segment totals and the
    consolidated totals principally relate to assets maintained at
    Corporate.

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Medication Delivery segment’s
    pre-tax income included charges of $588 million,
    $27 million and $125 million, respectively, related to
    COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion pumps. Refer to Note 5 for
    further information regarding these charges. Also included in
    the Medication Delivery segment’s pre-tax income in 2010
    was a $112 million impairment charge associated with the
    company’s agreement to divest its U.S. generic
    injectables business and a $62 million charge related to
    litigation associated with the company’s 2008 recall of its
    heparin sodium injection products in the United States. In 2009
    and 2008, the Medication Delivery segment’s pre-tax income
    included impairment charges of $54 million and
    $31 million, respectively, associated with the
    discontinuation of the company’s SOLOMIX drug delivery
    system in development and the CLEARSHOT pre-filled syringe
    program. Refer to Note 2 for further information regarding
    SOLOMIX and CLEARSHOT and the litigation-related charge and
    Note 3 for further information regarding the
    U.S. generic injectables business impairment charge.

Significant charges not allocated to a segment in 2010 included
    a $257 million charge related to business optimization
    efforts, as further discussed in Note 5, the Greece
    receivables charge of $28 million, as further discussed in
    Note 1, and IPR&D charges of $34 million, as
    further discussed in Note 4. In 2009, the $79 million
    charge related to the company’s business optimization
    efforts, as further discussed in Note 5, was not allocated
    to a segment. Significant charges not allocated to a segment in
    2008 included IPR&D charges of $19 million.

Management’s
    Responsibility for Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of the
    company’s consolidated financial statements and related
    information appearing in this report. Management believes that
    the consolidated financial statements fairly reflect the form
    and substance of transactions and that the financial statements
    reasonably present the company’s financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Management has also included in the company’s
    consolidated financial statements amounts that are based on
    estimates and judgments, which it believes are reasonable under
    the circumstances.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited the company’s consolidated
    financial statements in accordance with the standards
    established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and
    provides an opinion on whether the consolidated financial
    statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the
    company.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
    company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed under the supervision of the principal
    executive and financial officers, and effected by the board of
    directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America.

Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, management
    used the framework in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission.

Based on that assessment under the framework in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

, management concluded that the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2010. The effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Baxter
    International Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(1) present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of Baxter
    International Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
    2010 and December 31, 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO). The company’s management is
    responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting incorporated by
    reference under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express
    opinions on these financial statements and on the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our
    integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Controls
    and Procedures.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Baxter carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
    the participation of its Disclosure Committee and management,
    including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of Baxter’s disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2010.
    Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by Baxter in
    the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis
    and that such information is communicated to management,
    including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer
    and its board of directors, to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that the company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
    2010.

Assessment
    of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Baxter’s report of management’s assessment of the
    effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2010 and the audit report regarding the
    same of Baxter’s independent auditor,
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, are included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and are incorporated herein by reference.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In the second quarter of 2010, the company began the
    implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning
    system. In addition, the company is consolidating and
    outsourcing certain computer operations and application support
    activities. These multi-year initiatives will be conducted in
    phases and include modifications to the design and operation of
    controls over financial reporting. The company is testing
    internal controls over financial reporting for design
    effectiveness prior to implementation of each phase, and has
    monitoring controls in place over the implementation of these
    changes. There have been no other changes in Baxter’s
    internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended
    December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, Baxter’s internal
    control over financial reporting.
