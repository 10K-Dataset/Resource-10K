ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
(a)  GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.
 
    Baxter  International Inc. was  incorporated under Delaware  law in 1931. As
used in this report, except  as otherwise indicated in information  incorporated
by  reference, "Baxter" means Baxter International  Inc. and the "Company" means
Baxter and its subsidiaries.
 
    The Company  is  engaged  in the  worldwide  development,  distribution  and
manufacture  of  a  diversified  line of  products,  systems  and  services used
primarily in the health-care field. Products are manufactured by the Company  in
23  countries and sold in approximately  100 countries. Health-care is concerned
with the preservation  of health and  with the diagnosis,  cure, mitigation  and
treatment  of disease and body defects and deficiencies. The Company's more than
200,000  products  are  used  by   hospitals,  clinical  and  medical   research
laboratories, blood and dialysis centers, rehabilitation centers, nursing homes,
doctors'   offices  and  at  home   under  physician  supervision.  See  "Recent
Developments."
 
    For  information  regarding  acquisitions,  investments  in  affiliates  and
divestitures, see the Company's Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended
December  31, 1995  (the "Annual Report"),  page 53, section  entitled "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements--Acquisitions,  Investments in Affiliates  and
Divestitures" which is incorporated by reference.
 
(b)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.
 
    Incorporated  by  reference from  the  Annual Report,  pages  68-69, section
entitled "Notes to  Consolidated Financial  Statements--Industry and  Geographic
Information."
 
(c)  NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
 
Recent Developments
 
    SPIN-OFF OF HEALTH CARE COST MANAGEMENT BUSINESS
 
    On November 28, 1995, the board of directors of Baxter approved in principle
a  plan to distribute to Baxter stockholders all of the outstanding stock of its
health-care  cost   management  business   in   a  spin-off   transaction   (the
"Distribution")   which  is  expected  to  be  tax-free.  The  creation  of  two
independent  companies  will  enable  Baxter  and  the  new  company  to  devote
management  time, attention and  investments directly to  the core strategies of
each business. The new health-care cost management business will consist of  the
Company's   cost  management  services,  United  States  distribution,  surgical
products and  respiratory-therapy  operations  and will  operate  as  a  medical
supplier focused on helping customers manage the total cost of providing patient
care.  The Distribution is expected to occur in late 1996 and will result in the
health-care cost management  business operating  as an  independent entity  with
publicly-traded common stock.
 
    OFFER TO ACQUIRE NATIONAL MEDICAL CARE; SUBSEQUENT WITHDRAWAL
 
    On  February 1, 1996, Baxter publicly  announced its proposal to acquire the
National Medical Care ("NMC") subsidiary of W.R. Grace and Company ("Grace")  in
a  tax-free transaction for  $3.8 billion, consisting of  $1.8 billion of Baxter
common stock and a payment to Grace of $2.0 billion comprised of cash, notes and
assumed debt. Grace had previously announced its intention to spin-off or divest
NMC. Completion of this transaction in 1996 would have resulted in a dilution of
Baxter's net earnings, but
 

would have been accretive after approximately six quarters of combined  results.
The  Company's net-debt-to-net-capital  ratio would have  risen to approximately
42% (compared to  36.3% at December  31, 1995)  but was expected  to decline  to
approximately  40%  within  two years  of  the acquisition,  all  else remaining
constant.
 
    On February 5, 1996, Grace announced that  it had agreed to combine its  NMC
subsidiary  with the  worldwide dialysis  business of  Fresenius A.G.  (a German
company) to form a  new company called Fresenius  Medical Care in a  transaction
designed  to be tax-free. Fresenius A.G. is  a major competitor of the Company's
renal division and NMC is a large United States customer of the renal  division.
Under  the proposed  transaction with  Fresenius A.G.,  Grace shareholders would
receive a  44.8% equity  interest  in Fresenius  Medical  Care and  Grace  would
receive $2.3 billion in cash provided by proceeds of debt financing by Fresenius
Medical Care. This transaction is subject to the approval of the shareholders of
Grace,  Fresenius U.S.A.  and Fresenius  A.G. If  the transaction  with Grace is
consummated with Fresenius A.G., there  will be an increased competitive  threat
to  the Company's renal  division. However, management  believes that this would
not have a material adverse effect on Baxter's financial condition or results of
operations in 1996.
 
    Since the  management of  Grace refused  to discuss  the Company's  proposed
transaction, Baxter withdrew its offer on February 22, 1996.
 
    RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS
 
    The Company currently has two restructuring programs in process. In November
1993,  the  Company initiated  a  restructuring program  designed  to accelerate
growth and  reduce  costs  in  the  Company's  businesses  worldwide,  including
reorganizations  and  consolidations in  the  United States,  Europe,  Japan and
Canada.  In  the  third  quarter  of  1995,  the  Company  initiated  a   second
restructuring  program to consolidate manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico in
order to eliminate excess capacity and reduce manufacturing costs.
 
    Since the announcement of  the 1993 restructuring  program, the Company  has
implemented,  or is in the  process of implementing, all  of the major strategic
actions associated therewith and is satisfied that the program is progressing on
schedule and will  meet previously established  financial targets. During  1995,
the  Company  utilized  $60 million  of  restructuring reserves  related  to its
continuing operations, including  $36 million  in cash  payments. Cash  outflows
pertain   primarily  to  employee-related   costs  for  severance,  outplacement
assistance, relocation and retention. The Company has eliminated from continuing
operations approximately 1,250  positions of the  approximately 1,640  positions
affected  by the program. The majority of the remaining reductions will occur in
1996 and 1997, as facility closures and consolidations are completed as planned.
During 1995,  the  Company  realized approximately  $90  million  in  continuing
operations  savings which  represents a  shortfall of  approximately $20 million
from its estimated  savings target. This  shortfall is primarily  due to  timing
delays  in the implementation of a number of projects. Management has forecasted
continuing operations  savings  of  approximately $110  million  in  1996,  $130
million  in 1997 and exceeding $140 million in 1998. Management anticipates that
these savings will be partially  invested in increased research and  development
and  expansion into  growing international markets.  Management further believes
that its remaining restructuring reserves  are adequate to complete the  actions
contemplated by the 1993 restructuring program.
 
    Management   is  at  the   very  early  stages   of  implementing  the  1995
restructuring program, which is expected to be completed by the end of 1998. The
pretax restructuring charge  of $93 million  includes approximately $67  million
for  valuation  adjustments  as a  result  of  the Company's  decision  to close
facilities.
 
    The Company expects to spend approximately $26 million in cash over the next
two years, including severance related to the approximately 1,450 positions that
will be eliminated  in connection  with the 1995  plan. The  plant closures  and
consolidations  in  Puerto Rico  will lower  the Company's  manufacturing costs.
Management believes these actions will  help mitigate the Company's exposure  to
future gross
 

margin erosion arising from pricing pressure, primarily in the United States. In
addition  to  the consolidation  of  the Company's  manufacturing  operations in
Puerto Rico, the Company has initiated plans for other organizational  structure
changes which have resulted in a $10 million provision for cash payments related
to employee severance.
 
    Management  anticipates that  future cash  expenditures related  to both the
1993 and 1995  restructuring programs will  be funded from  cash generated  from
operations.
 
Industry Overview
 
    The  Company operates  in a  single industry  segment as  a world  leader in
providing health-care  products  for  use in  hospitals  and  other  health-care
settings.  On a  global basis,  the Company  develops, manufactures  and markets
intravenous  solutions  and   related  administration   equipment,  and   highly
specialized  medical  products  for  treating kidney  and  heart  disease, blood
disorders, and  for  collecting and  processing  blood. These  products  include
intravenous  solutions and  pumps; dialysis  equipment and  supplies; prosthetic
heart valves and cardiac catheters;  blood-clotting therapies; and machines  and
supplies  for collecting, separating  and storing blood.  These products require
extensive research and  development and investment  in worldwide  manufacturing,
marketing and administrative infrastructure.
 
    Information  about segment  operating results  is incorporated  by reference
from the Annual Report, pages  30-43, section entitled "Management's  Discussion
and Analysis" and pages 68-69, section entitled "Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements--Industry and Geographic Information."
 
    UNITED STATES MARKETS
 
    Though   the  federal   government  failed  to   enact  health-care  reform,
fundamental change  continued to  be a  part of  the United  States  health-care
system  in 1995. Competition for  patients among health-care providers continues
to intensify.  Increasingly, providers  are looking  for ways  to better  manage
costs   in  areas  such  as  materials  handling,  supply  utilization,  product
standardization for  specific  procedures  and  capital  expenditures.  The  new
health-care  cost management  business is  being distributed  to stockholders to
more optimally meet these emerging market needs, remove limitations, and improve
the competitiveness of  both Baxter  and the new  company. There  has also  been
consolidation  in  the Company's  customer base  and  by its  competitors. These
trends are expected to  continue. In recent years,  the Company's overall  price
increases  have been  below the  Consumer Price  Index, and  industry trends and
competition may inhibit the Company's ability to increase prices in the future.
 
    INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
 
    Throughout the world, as developing countries create more wealth,  improving
the  health  and  well-being of  their  citizens  becomes a  much  higher social
priority and usually leads to increased per-capita spending on health care.  The
world's  largest  developing  markets in  the  Pacific Rim  countries  and Latin
America are all poised for significant economic growth. Based on these  factors,
management  believes  there will  be  improved expansion  opportunities  for the
Company with its broad portfolio of proven cost-effective products, services and
therapies  to   meet  the   demands   of  these   markets.  In   the   developed
world--especially  in  Western Europe  and Japan--there  continues to  be strong
demand for more technologically advanced and cost-effective therapies,  products
and  services, and the Company has long been  a leader in these markets. In view
of these conditions,  management believes the  Company's best opportunities  for
growth  are outside  the United  States. Consequently,  the Company's strategies
emphasize international expansion to capitalize  on the Company's strong  global
positions   in   intravenous   products,   renal   therapy,   biotechnology  and
cardiovascular therapies.
 
    HEALTH-CARE COST ENVIRONMENT
 
    Accelerating cost  pressures on  United States  hospitals are  resulting  in
increased  out-patient  and alternate-site  health-care  service delivery  and a
focus on cost-effectiveness and quality. In addition, technological advances  in
health-care  product and service  offerings are increasingly  evaluated on their
ability to both  improve the  quality of  care and  provide more  cost-effective
outcomes. These forces increasingly shape the demand for, and supply of, medical
care.
 

    Many  private health-care payers  are providing incentives  for consumers to
seek lower cost care  outside the hospital.  Many corporations' employee  health
plans  have been  restructured to provide  financial incentives  for patients to
utilize the most cost-effective forms of treatment (managed care programs,  such
as  health maintenance organizations,  have become more  common), and physicians
have been encouraged to provide more cost-effective treatments.
 
    The future financial success of  health-care product and service  companies,
such  as the  Company, will  depend on  their ability  to work  with health-care
customers to help them  enhance their competitiveness.  The Company believes  it
can  help  its customers  achieve  savings in  the  total health-care  system by
automating  supply-ordering   procedures,  optimizing   distribution   networks,
improving  materials management and achieving economies of scale associated with
aggregating purchases. The  Company continues  to believe that  its strategy  of
providing  unmatched service to its health-care customers and achieving the best
overall cost in its delivery of health-care products and services is  compatible
with  any  realignment  of  the  United  States  health-care  system  which  may
ultimately occur.
 
Joint Ventures
 
    The Company  conducts a  portion  of its  business through  joint  ventures,
including  a joint venture  with Nestle, S.A. to  develop, market and distribute
clinical nutrition products worldwide. This joint venture is accounted for under
the equity method of  accounting and therefore, is  excluded from the  Company's
segment results.
 
Methods of Distribution
 
    The  Company  conducts  its  selling efforts  through  its  subsidiaries and
divisions. Many  subsidiaries and  divisions  have their  own sales  forces  and
direct  their  own sales  efforts. In  addition, sales  are made  to independent
distributors, dealers and  sales agents. Distribution  centers, which may  serve
more  than one  division, are  stocked with  adequate inventories  to facilitate
prompt customer service. Sales and distribution methods include frequent contact
by  sales  representatives,  automated  communications  via  various  electronic
purchasing  systems, circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins, direct
mail campaigns, trade publications and advertising.
 
    International sales and distribution are made in approximately 100 countries
either  on  a   direct  basis   or  through   independent  local   distributors.
International  subsidiaries employ  their own  field sales  forces in Argentina,
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,  Brunei, Canada, China, Colombia,  Ecuador,
Denmark,  Finland, France, Germany,  Hong Kong, India,  Indonesia, Italy, Japan,
Malaysia,  Mexico,  the   Netherlands,  New  Zealand,   Norway,  Pakistan,   the
Philippines,  Singapore, Spain,  Sweden, Switzerland,  Taiwan, Thailand  and the
United  Kingdom.  In  other  countries,  sales  are  made  through   independent
distributors or sales agents.
 
Raw Materials
 
    Raw materials essential to the Company's business are purchased worldwide in
the  ordinary course of  business from numerous suppliers.  The vast majority of
these materials are generally available, and no serious shortages or delays have
been encountered. Certain raw materials used in producing some of the  Company's
products,  including its latex products, are  available only from a small number
of suppliers. In addition, certain biomaterials for medical implant applications
(primarily polymers)  are  becoming  more  difficult to  obtain  due  to  market
withdrawals  by  biomaterial  suppliers,  primarily  as  a  result  of perceived
exposures to liability in the United States.
 
    In some of these situations, the Company has long-term supply contracts with
its suppliers,  although  it  does  not  consider  its  obligations  under  such
contracts  to be  material. The Company  does not always  recover cost increases
through customer pricing due to contractual  limits and market pressure on  such
price increases. See "Contractual Arrangements."
 

Patents and Trademarks
 
    The Company owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and
is  licensed  under patents  owned  by others.  While  it seeks  patents  on new
developments whenever feasible, the Company does not consider any one or more of
its patents,  or the  licenses granted  to  or by  it, to  be essential  to  its
business.
 
    Products  manufactured  by  the Company  are  sold primarily  under  its own
trademarks and trade names.  Some products purchased and  resold by the  Company
are sold under the Company's trade names while others are sold under trade names
owned by its suppliers.
 
Competition
 
    Historically, competition in the health-care industry has been characterized
by  the search for technological and  therapeutic innovations in the prevention,
diagnosis and treatment of disease. The  Company believes that it has  benefited
from  the technological advantages of certain of its products. While others will
continue to introduce new products which compete with those sold by the Company,
the Company believes that its research and development effort will permit it  to
remain  competitive in all presently material  product areas. Although no single
company competes with the Company in all of its businesses, the Company is faced
with substantial competition in all of its markets.
 
    The changing health-care environment in recent years has led to increasingly
intense competition  among  health-care  suppliers. Competition  is  focused  on
price,  service and product performance. Pressure  in these areas is expected to
continue. See "Health-Care Cost Environment" and "United States Markets."
 
    In part  through  its  restructuring  programs,  the  Company  continues  to
increase  its  efforts  to minimize  costs  and better  meet  accelerating price
competition. The  Company  believes that  its  cost position  will  continue  to
benefit from improvements in manufacturing technology and increased economies of
scale.  The Company  continues to  emphasize its  investments in  innovative and
cost-effective technologies and the quality of its product and services.
 
Credit and Working Capital Practices
 
    The Company's debt ratings of A3 on senior debt by Moody's, A- by Standard &
Poor's and A by  Duff & Phelps  were reaffirmed by each  rating agency in  1995.
However,  the rating  agencies have placed  the Company on  credit watch pending
clarification of  the  Company's  capital  structure  in  conjunction  with  the
Distribution of the health-care cost management business.
 
    The  Company's  credit  practices  and  related  working  capital  needs are
comparable to those of other market participants. Collection periods tend to  be
longer for sales outside the United States.
 
    Customers  may return  defective merchandise  for credit  or replacement. In
recent years, such returns have been insignificant.
 
Quality Control
 
    The Company places great emphasis on providing quality products and services
to its customers. An  integrated network of  quality systems, including  control
procedures   that  are   developed  and   implemented  by   technically  trained
professionals, result  in  rigid  specifications for  raw  materials,  packaging
materials,  labels, sterilization  procedures and  overall manufacturing process
control. The quality systems integrate the efforts of raw material and  finished
goods  suppliers to  provide the  highest value  to customers.  On a statistical
sampling basis, a quality assurance  organization tests components and  finished
goods  at different stages in the  manufacturing process to assure that exacting
standards are met.
 
Research and Development
 
    The Company  is actively  engaged in  research and  development programs  to
develop   and  improve  products,  systems   and  manufacturing  methods.  These
activities are performed at 21  research and development centers located  around
the   world   and   include   facilities   in   Australia,   Belgium,   Germany,
 

Italy, Japan, Malta, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the  United
States.  Expenditures for Company-sponsored  research and development activities
related to continuing operations were $345 million in 1995, $303 million in 1994
and $280 million in 1993.
 
    The  Company's   research   efforts  emphasize   self-manufactured   product
development, and portions of that research relate to multiple product lines. For
example,  many product categories benefit from  the Company's research effort as
applied to the human body's circulatory systems. In addition, research  relating
to the performance and purity of plastic materials has resulted in advances that
are  applicable to a large number of  the Company's products. Principal areas of
strategic  focus   for   research   are   biotechnology,   renal   therapy   and
transplantation, blood disorders and cardiovascular disease.
 
Government Regulation
 
    Most  products manufactured or sold by the  Company in the United States are
subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), as well as by
other federal  and  state  agencies.  The FDA  regulates  the  introduction  and
advertising  of  new  drugs and  devices  as well  as  manufacturing procedures,
labeling and record keeping with respect to  drugs and devices. The FDA has  the
power  to seize adulterated  or misbranded drugs  and devices or  to require the
manufacturer to remove them from the market and the power to publicize  relevant
facts.  From time to time, the Company has removed products from the market that
were found  not to  meet acceptable  standards. This  may occur  in the  future.
Product  regulatory laws  exist in most  other countries where  the Company does
business.
 
    Environmental policies of the Company mandate compliance with all applicable
regulatory requirements concerning environmental quality and contemplate,  among
other  things,  appropriate capital  expenditures for  environmental protection.
Various non-material capital expenditures for environmental protection were made
by the Company during  1995 and similar expenditures  are planned for 1996.  See
Item 3.--"Legal Proceedings."
 
Employees
 
    As  of December 31, 1995, the  Company employed approximately 56,580 people,

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
 
    Incorporated  by  reference from  the  Annual Report,  pages  62-68, section
entitled  "Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements--Legal   Proceedings."
Additionally, in March 1996, and after the Annual Report was printed, the courts
in Osaka and Tokyo issued second settlement plans and second interim opinions in
the  Japanese Factor Concentrate cases. Those  plans and opinions supplement the
courts' original  plans  for resolution  of  the litigation  by  confirming  the
approximate  $450,000 up-front payment to each  plaintiff, which is to be funded
60% by the corporate defendants and 40% by the Japanese government. The  courts'
plans   and  opinions  also  establish   on-going  payments  to  AIDS-manifested
hemophiliacs at $1,500 per month and set attorneys' fees at $35,000 per  current
plaintiff  and $15,000 per future plaintiff.  The courts' plans provide that the
Japanese government  will fund  40% of  those amounts,  and that  the  corporate
defendants  will fund 60% with the corporate defendants funding their amounts in
proportion to their 1983 market shares, resulting in the Company paying 12.5% of
the overall corporate defendants' share. The courts' plans also provide for  the
continuation  of the Yuai Zaidan for  non-plaintiffs through March 2001, for the
Japanese government to fund  40% of the aggregate  amount required for the  Yuai
Zaidan,  for 100% credit  of future Yuai Zaidan  payments to individuals against
settlement amounts paid after the settlement  is approved, and for the entry  of
future  plaintiffs into the  fund. On March  13, 1996, the  Company accepted the
basic terms of the  courts' imposed settlement. Negotiations  on the details  of
the settlement are continuing.
