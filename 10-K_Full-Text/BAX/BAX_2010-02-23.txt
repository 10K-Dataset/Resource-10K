Company
    Overview

Baxter International Inc., through its subsidiaries, develops,
    manufactures and markets products that save and sustain the
    lives of people with hemophilia, immune disorders, infectious
    diseases, kidney disease, trauma, and other chronic and acute
    medical conditions. As a global, diversified healthcare company,
    Baxter applies a unique combination of expertise in medical
    devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to create products
    that advance patient care worldwide. These products are used by
    hospitals, kidney dialysis centers, nursing homes,
    rehabilitation centers, doctors’ offices, clinical and
    medical research laboratories, and by patients at home under
    physician supervision. Baxter manufactures products in 27
    countries and sells them in more than 100 countries.

Baxter International Inc. was incorporated under Delaware law in
    1931. As used in this report, except as otherwise indicated in
    information incorporated by reference, “Baxter
    International” means Baxter International Inc. and
    “Baxter,” the “company” or the
    “Company” means Baxter International and its
    consolidated subsidiaries.

Business
    Segments

The BioScience, Medication Delivery and Renal segments comprise
    Baxter’s continuing operations.

BioScience.

The BioScience business processes
    recombinant and plasma-based proteins to treat hemophilia and
    other bleeding disorders; plasma-based therapies to treat immune
    deficiencies, alpha

1-antitrypsin

deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute
    blood-related conditions; products for regenerative medicine,
    such as biosurgery products; and vaccines.

Medication Delivery.

The Medication Delivery
    business manufactures intravenous (IV) solutions and
    administration sets, premixed drugs and drug-reconstitution
    systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for injectable drugs, IV
    nutrition products, infusion pumps, and inhalation anesthetics,
    as well as products and services related to pharmacy
    compounding, drug formulation and packaging technologies.

Renal.

The Renal business provides products to
    treat end-stage renal disease, or irreversible kidney failure.
    The business manufactures solutions and other products for
    peritoneal dialysis (PD), a home-based therapy, and also
    distributes products for hemodialysis (HD), which is generally
    conducted in a hospital or clinic.

For financial information about Baxter’s segments and
    principal product categories, see “Note 12 Segment
    Information” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Sales and
    Distribution

The company has its own direct sales force and also makes sales
    to and through independent distributors, drug wholesalers acting
    as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or homecare companies. In
    the United States, Cardinal Health, Inc. warehouses and ships a
    significant portion of the company’s products through its
    distribution centers. These centers are generally stocked with
    adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service.
    Sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales
    representatives, automated communications via various electronic
    purchasing systems, circulation of catalogs and merchandising
    bulletins, direct-mail campaigns, trade publication presence and
    advertising.

International sales are made and products are distributed on a
    direct basis or through independent local distributors or sales
    agents in more than 100 countries.

International
    Markets

Baxter generates approximately 60% of its revenues outside the
    United States. While healthcare cost containment continues to be
    a focus around the world, demand for healthcare products and
    services continues


to be strong worldwide. The company’s strategies emphasize
    global expansion and technological innovation to advance medical
    care worldwide. Baxter’s operations are subject to certain
    additional risks inherent in conducting business outside the
    United States, such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates,
    changes in exchange controls, loss of business in government
    tenders, nationalization, increasingly complex labor
    environments, availability of raw materials, expropriation and
    other governmental actions, changes in taxation, importation
    limitations, export control restrictions, changes in or
    violations of U.S. or local laws, dependence on a few
    government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic
    and political destabilization or instability, disputes between
    countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual
    property, disruption or destruction of operations in a
    significant geographic region — due to the location of
    manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or customers.

For financial information about foreign and domestic operations
    and geographic information see “Note 12 Segment
    Information” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Contractual
    Arrangements

Substantial portions of the company’s products are sold
    through contracts with customers, both within and outside the
    United States. Some of these contracts have terms of more than
    one year and place limits on our ability to increase prices. In
    the case of hospitals, governments and other facilities, these
    contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product
    or categories of products to be purchased by the customer.

In keeping with the increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness in
    healthcare delivery, many hospitals and other customers of
    medical products in the United States and in other countries
    have joined group purchasing organizations (GPOs), or combined
    to form integrated delivery networks (IDNs), to enhance
    purchasing power. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements
    with manufacturers and distributors, and the negotiated prices
    are made available to members. Baxter has purchasing agreements
    with several of the major GPOs in the United States. GPOs may
    have agreements with more than one supplier for certain
    products. Accordingly, in these cases, Baxter faces competition
    from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a GPO
    under contract with Baxter.

Raw
    Materials

Raw materials essential to Baxter’s business are purchased
    from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of
    business. Although most of these materials are generally
    available, certain raw materials used in producing some of the
    company’s products are available only from one or a limited
    number of suppliers, and Baxter at times may experience
    shortages of supply. In an effort to manage risk associated with
    raw materials supply, Baxter works closely with its suppliers to
    help ensure availability and continuity of supply while
    maintaining high quality and reliability. The company also seeks
    to develop new and alternative sources of supply where
    beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy.

The company also utilizes long-term supply contracts with some
    suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the
    risk of price increases. Baxter is not always able to recover
    cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to
    contractual limits and market pressure on such price increases.

Competition

Baxter’s BioScience, Medication Delivery and Renal
    businesses enjoy leading positions based on a number of
    competitive advantages. The BioScience business benefits from
    continued innovation in its products and therapies, consistency
    of its supply of products, and strong customer relationships.
    The Medication Delivery business benefits from the breadth and
    depth of its product offering, as well as strong relationships
    with customers, including hospitals, customer purchasing groups
    and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The Renal
    business benefits from its position as one of the world’s
    leading manufacturers of PD products, as well as its strong
    relationships with customers and patients, including the many
    patients who self-administer the home-based therapy supplied by
    Baxter. Baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost
    advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and
    the technological advantages of its products.


Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its
    businesses, Baxter faces competition in each of its segments
    from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical
    companies of all sizes. BioScience continues to face competitors
    from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies.
    Medication Delivery faces competition from medical device
    manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies particularly in the
    multi-source generics and anesthetics markets. In Renal, global
    and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing
    capacity for PD products and their PD sales and marketing
    channels. Competition is primarily focused on
    cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and
    technological innovation. There has been increasing
    consolidation in the company’s customer base and by its
    competitors, which continues to result in pricing and market
    share pressures.

Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to
    exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world
    use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, such
    as price controls, product formularies (lists of recommended or
    approved products), and competitive tenders which require the
    submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of Baxter’s
    products are dependent, in part, on the availability of
    reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as
    well as insurance companies and other private payers. In the
    United States, the federal and many state governments have
    adopted or proposed initiatives relating to Medicaid and other
    health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates
    that Baxter and other providers are required to pay to the
    state. In addition to government regulation, managed care
    organizations in the United States, which include medical
    insurance companies, medical plan administrators,
    health-maintenance organizations, hospital and physician
    alliances and pharmacy benefit managers, continue to put
    pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products. Managed
    care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures, and
    their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their
    consolidation into fewer, larger organizations and a growing
    number of enrolled patients. Baxter faces similar issues outside
    of the United States. In Europe and Latin America, for example,
    the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and
    controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public
    tenders, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public
    tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain
    products.

Intellectual
    Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to
    Baxter’s business. Baxter relies on patents, trademarks,
    copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and confidentiality
    agreements to develop, maintain and strengthen its competitive
    position. Baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks
    throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements
    relating to various third-party patents and technologies.
    Products manufactured by Baxter are sold primarily under its own
    trademarks and trade names. Some products distributed by the
    company are sold under the company’s trade names while
    others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers. Trade
    secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary
    information is also important to Baxter. The company maintains
    certain details about its processes, products, and technology as
    trade secrets and generally requires employees, consultants,
    parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners
    to enter into confidentiality agreements.

Baxter’s policy is to protect its products and technology
    through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis. This
    protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such
    protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company.
    Baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of
    its patents and trademarks. Baxter will continue to take
    commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and
    trademarks around the world against potential infringers,
    including taking judicial or administrative action where
    appropriate.

Baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent
    litigation. At any given time, the company is involved as either
    a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and
    other intellectual property-related actions. Such litigation can
    result in significant royalty or other payments or result in
    injunctions that can prevent the sale of products. For more
    information, see “Note 11 Legal Proceedings” in
    Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.


Research
    and Development

Baxter’s investment in research and development (R&D)
    is essential to its future growth and its ability to remain
    competitive in all three of its business segments. Accordingly,
    Baxter continues to increase its investment in R&D programs
    to develop innovative therapies, technology platforms and
    manufacturing methods. Expenditures for Baxter’s R&D
    activities were $917 million in 2009, $868 million in
    2008, and $760 million in 2007. These expenditures include
    costs associated with R&D activities performed at the
    company’s R&D centers located around the world, which
    include facilities in Austria, Belgium, Japan and the United
    States, as well as in-licensing, milestone and reimbursement
    payments made to partners for R&D work performed at
    non-Baxter locations.

Principal areas of strategic focus for R&D include
    recombinant and plasma-based therapeutics, vaccines, initiatives
    in regenerative medicine, kidney dialysis, small molecule drugs,
    enhanced packaging systems for medication delivery, drug
    formulation technologies, and pharmacy compounding. The
    company’s research efforts emphasize self-manufactured
    product development, and portions of that research relate to
    multiple product categories. Baxter supplements its own R&D
    efforts by acquiring various technologies and entering into
    development and other collaboration agreements with third
    parties. For more information on the company’s R&D
    activities, please refer to our discussion under the caption
    entitled “Research and Development” contained in
    Item 7 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Quality
    Management

Baxter places significant emphasis on providing quality products
    and services to its customers. Quality management plays an
    essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements,
    preventing defects and improving the company’s products and
    services. Baxter has a network of quality systems throughout the
    company’s business units and facilities that relate to the
    design, development, manufacturing, packaging, sterilization,
    handling, distribution and labeling of the company’s
    products. To assess and facilitate compliance with applicable
    requirements, the company regularly reviews its quality systems
    to determine their effectiveness and identify areas for
    improvement. Baxter also performs assessments of its suppliers
    of raw materials, components and finished goods. In addition,
    the company conducts quality management reviews designed to
    inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of
    products and services.

From time to time, the company may determine that products
    manufactured or marketed by the company do not meet company
    specifications, published standards, such as those issued by the
    International Organization for Standardization, or regulatory
    requirements. When a quality issue is identified, Baxter
    investigates the issue and takes appropriate corrective action,
    such as withdrawal of the product from the market, correction of
    the product at the customer location, notice to the customer of
    revised labeling, and other actions. For more information on
    corrective actions taken by Baxter, please refer to our
    discussion under the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory
    Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Government
    Regulation

The operations of Baxter and many of the products manufactured
    or sold by the company are subject to extensive regulation by
    numerous government agencies, both within and outside the United
    States. In the United States, the federal agencies that regulate
    the company’s facilities, operations, employees, products
    (their manufacture, sale, import and export) and services
    include: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the
    Drug Enforcement Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency,
    the Occupational Health & Safety Administration, the
    Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the
    Department of Defense, Customs and Border Protection, the
    Department of Commerce, the Department of Treasury and others.
    Because Baxter supplies products and services to healthcare
    providers that are reimbursed by federally funded programs such
    as Medicare, its activities are also subject to regulation by
    the Center for Medicare/Medicaid Services and enforcement by the
    Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health
    and Human Services (OIG). State agencies in the United States
    also regulate the facilities, operations, employees, products
    and services of the company within their respective states.
    Outside the United States, our products and operations are
    subject to extensive regulation by government agencies,
    including the European Medicines


Agency (EMEA) in the European Union. International government
    agencies also regulate public health, product registration,
    manufacturing, environmental conditions, labor, exports, imports
    and other aspects of the company’s global operations.

The FDA in the United States, the EMEA in Europe, and other
    government agencies inside and outside of the United States,
    administer requirements covering the testing, safety,
    effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and
    advertising, distribution and post-market surveillance of
    Baxter’s products. The company must obtain specific
    approval from the FDA and

non-U.S. regulatory

authorities before it can market and sell most of its products
    in a particular country. Even after the company obtains
    regulatory approval to market a product, the product and the
    company’s manufacturing processes are subject to continued
    review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities worldwide.

The company is subject to possible administrative and legal
    actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies inside and
    outside the United States. Such actions may include warning
    letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions,
    injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products,
    civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant
    approvals, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing
    approvals. From time to time, the company takes steps to ensure
    safety and efficacy of its products, such as removing products
    from the market found not to meet applicable requirements and
    improving the effectiveness of quality systems. For more
    information on compliance actions taken by the company, please
    refer to our discussion under the caption entitled “Certain
    Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Environmental policies of the company require compliance with
    all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate, among
    other things, appropriate capital expenditures for environmental
    protection.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, Baxter employed approximately
    49,700 people.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider
    the following risk factors. If any of the events described below
    occurs, our business, financial condition and results of
    operations and future growth prospects could suffer.

If we
    are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to
    keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be adversely
    affected.

The successful and timely implementation of our business model
    depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and
    introduce new products. As our competitors will continue to
    introduce competitive products, the development and acquisition
    of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy,
    safety, patients’ and clinicians’ ease of use and
    cost-effectiveness are important to our success. The success of
    new product offerings will depend on many factors, including our
    ability to properly anticipate and satisfy


customer needs, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis,
    develop and manufacture products in an economic and timely
    manner, obtain

and/or

maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual
    property, and differentiate our products from those of our
    competitors. Failure by us to introduce planned products or
    other new products or to introduce products on schedule could
    have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

The development and acquisition of innovative products and
    technologies that improve efficacy, safety, patients’ and
    clinicians’ ease of use and cost-effectiveness involve
    significant technical and business risks. If we cannot adapt to
    changing technologies or anticipate changes in our current and
    potential customers’ requirements our products may become
    obsolete, and our business could suffer. Our success will
    depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our
    existing products, develop new technology that addresses the
    increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective
    customers, license or acquire leading technologies and respond
    to technological advances and emerging industry standards and
    practices on a timely and cost-effective basis.

We are
    subject to a number of existing laws and regulations,
    non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations, and we are
    susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.

As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and
    products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous
    government agencies, both inside and outside the United States.
    The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are subject
    to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number
    of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by
    specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be
    capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies
    with those laws and regulations.

The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products
    are subject to extensive regulation and increasing scrutiny by
    the FDA and other regulatory authorities both inside and outside
    the United States. Any new product must undergo lengthy and
    rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming
    procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory
    authorities. We may elect to delay or cancel our anticipated
    regulatory submissions for new indications for our current or
    proposed new products for a number of reasons. Failure to comply
    with the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities
    could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures,
    monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and
    distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal
    of a government to grant approvals, restrictions on operations
    or withdrawal of existing approvals. Any of these actions could
    cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products,
    which could adversely affect our sales.

We continue to address a number of regulatory issues as
    discussed further under the caption entitled “Certain
    Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that
    additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be
    incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to the
    company will not occur, that substantial additional charges or
    significant asset impairments may not be required, or that
    additional legislation or regulation will not be introduced that
    may adversely affect the company’s operations. Third
    parties may also file claims against us in connection with these
    issues. In addition, sales of the related products may continue
    to be affected and sales of other Baxter products may be
    adversely affected if we do not adequately address these issues.

The sales and marketing of our products and our relationships
    with healthcare providers are under increasing scrutiny by
    federal, state and foreign government agencies. The FDA, the
    OIG, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade
    Commission have each increased their enforcement efforts with
    respect to the anti-kickback statute, False Claims Act,
    off-label promotion of products, other healthcare related laws,
    antitrust and other competition laws. The DOJ has announced an
    increased focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) particularly as it relates to the
    conduct of pharmaceutical companies. Foreign governments have
    also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies’
    sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare
    providers. The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale
    and reimbursement of our products and those governing our
    relationships with healthcare


providers and governments can be complicated, are subject to
    frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. We have
    compliance programs in place, including policies, training and
    various forms of monitoring designed to address these risks.
    Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect
    us from conduct by our employees that violate these laws.
    Violations, or allegations of violations, of these laws may
    result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from
    participating in government programs, diversion of management
    time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Issues
    with product quality could have an adverse effect on our
    business and subject us to regulatory actions and costly
    litigation.

Quality management plays an essential role in determining and
    meeting customer requirements, preventing defects and improving
    the company’s products and services. Our future operating
    results will depend on our ability to implement and improve our
    quality management program, and effectively train and manage our
    employee base with respect to quality management. While we have
    a network of quality systems throughout our business units and
    facilities that relate to the design, development,
    manufacturing, packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution
    and labeling of our products, quality and safety issues may
    occur with respect to any of our products. In addition, some of
    the raw materials employed in our production processes are
    derived from human and animal origins. Though great care is
    taken to assure the safety of these raw materials, the nature of
    their origin elevates the potential for the introduction of
    pathogenic agents or other contaminants.

A quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations and may
    result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary
    sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of
    products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government
    to grant approvals, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of
    existing approvals. An inability to address a quality or safety
    issue in an effective manner on a timely basis may also cause a
    loss of customer confidence in us or our products, which may
    result in the loss of sales. In addition, we may be named as a
    defendant in product liability or other lawsuits, which could
    result in costly litigation, reduced sales, significant
    liabilities and diversion of our management’s time,
    attention and resources. We continue to be self-insured with
    respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party
    insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to
    unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Even claims without
    merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to
    incur significant legal fees.

For more information on certain regulatory matters currently
    being addressed by the company with the FDA, please refer to
    “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Changes
    in the healthcare regulatory environment, including the pending
    healthcare reform being contemplated by the United States
    Congress, may adversely affect our business.

Changes currently being contemplated in healthcare regulatory
    environments worldwide may restrict our operations or our
    growth. Congress is currently debating reforming the current
    healthcare system in the United States and the laws and
    regulations that will determine how that reform may be
    implemented. Some of the laws currently under debate may
    adversely affect the revenue generated by our products

and/or

the
    taxes we pay. These taxes may include a tax related to the sales
    (or market share) of our medical devices and drugs. Because each
    of our business units sell medical devices and drugs it is
    expected that each would be impacted by these proposed taxes. In
    addition to possible increases in taxes, there is a provision
    currently under consideration which is intended to expand the
    use of the “340B Drug Discount Program.” The 340B
    program provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals
    serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the
    purchases of drugs for outpatient use. It has been proposed that
    eligibility for these discounts be expanded to other entities
    and to the purchase of drugs for inpatient use. These additional
    taxes and compulsory discounts, if enacted, may adversely affect
    our business by decreasing revenues and profits, diminishing our
    ability to generate sufficient capital available for R&D
    and forcing us to discontinue products that cannot support the
    increased tax or discount burden.


None of the legislation described above has been enacted. We are
    unable to predict with any degree of certainty what, if any,
    legislation will be enacted and if so what impact such
    legislation will ultimately have on our business.

If
    reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or
    modified, our business could suffer.

Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which
    the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance,
    managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management
    organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration
    authorities, private health coverage insurers and other
    third-party payors. These healthcare management organizations
    and third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices
    charged for medical products and services. Additionally, as
    discussed above, the containment of healthcare costs has become
    a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of
    drugs and other healthcare products have been targeted in this
    effort. We also face challenges in certain foreign markets where
    the pricing and profitability of our products generally are
    subject to government controls. Government controls in foreign
    markets also impact our ability to collect accounts receivable
    in a timely manner. Accordingly, our current and potential
    products may not be considered cost effective, and reimbursement
    to the consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us
    to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and
    regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change
    at any time and in ways that are difficult to predict and these
    changes may be adverse to us. Any reduction in Medicare,
    Medicaid or other third-party payor reimbursements could have a
    negative effect on our operating results.

Consolidation
    in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

There has been consolidation in our customer base, and by our
    competitors, which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures.
    As these consolidations occur, competition to provide products
    like ours will become more intense, and the importance of
    establishing relationships with key industry participants
    including GPOs, IDNs and other customers will become greater.
    Customers will continue to work and organize to negotiate price
    reductions for our products and services. To the extent we are
    forced to reduce our prices, our business will become less
    profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding
    reductions in costs. The company’s sales could be adversely
    affected if any of its contracts with its GPOs, IDNs or other
    customers are terminated in part or in their entirety, or
    members decide to purchase from another supplier.

We
    face substantial competition and many of our competitors have
    significantly greater financial and other
    resources.

Although no single company competes with us in all of our
    businesses, we face substantial competition in each of our
    segments, from international and domestic healthcare and
    pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily
    focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product
    performance, and technological innovation. Some competitors,
    principally large pharmaceutical companies, have greater
    financial, R&D and marketing resources than us. Competition
    may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our
    markets or modify their existing products to compete directly
    with ours. Greater financial, R&D and marketing resources
    may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or
    emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that
    may render our products obsolete or non-competitive. If our
    competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or
    achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization
    than we do, our operations will likely be negatively affected.

We also face competition for marketing, distribution and
    collaborative development agreements, for establishing
    relationships with academic and research institutions, and for
    licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic
    institutions, government agencies and other public and private
    research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent
    protection and establish collaborative arrangements for
    discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of
    products similar to ours. These companies and institutions
    compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific
    and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies
    complementary to our programs. If we are unable to successfully
    compete with these companies and institutions, our business may
    suffer.


If we
    are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a
    timely basis, our business may be adversely
    affected.

The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of
    sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We
    manufacture our products in over 50 manufacturing facilities
    around the world. We acquire our components and materials from
    many suppliers in various countries. While efforts are made to
    diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain
    instances we acquire components and materials from a sole
    supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the
    continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will
    continue to be successful. In addition, due to the regulatory
    environment in which we operate, we may be unable to quickly
    establish additional or replacement sources for some components
    or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an
    inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could
    adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a
    timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product
    sales.

If we
    are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights,
    or if we infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of
    others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be
    materially damaged.

Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our
    business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our
    ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent
    rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We
    cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in
    issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be
    challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will
    not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property
    rights of others will not prevent the company from selling
    certain products or including key features in the company’s
    products.

The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain
    and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant
    litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our
    industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and
    validity of our patents on products or processes as well as
    allegations that our products infringe patents held by
    competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types
    of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the
    ability to market products, which could lead to a significant
    loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of
    operations.

We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and
    know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive
    positions. While we protect our proprietary rights to the extent
    possible, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know,
    discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary
    information or techniques, or that they will not gain access to
    our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.
    Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect
    unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets.
    Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property
    would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may
    cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.

If our
    business development activities are unsuccessful, our business
    could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely
    affected.

We are engaged in business development activities including
    evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities,
    technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These
    activities may result in substantial investment of the
    company’s resources. Our success developing products or
    expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a
    number of factors, including our ability to find suitable
    opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether
    we are able to establish an acquisition, investment or alliance
    on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other
    company’s underlying technology, products and ability to
    execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and
    litigation related to these products or technology; and our
    ability to successfully integrate the acquired company,
    business, product, technology or research into our existing
    operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired
    in-process research and development projects. If we are
    unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be
    unable to meet our financial targets and we may be required to
    record asset impairment charges.


If we
    are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities or exiting
    low margin businesses or discontinuing low profit products, our
    business, financial condition and results could be adversely
    affected.

Successful execution of our business strategy depends, in part,
    on improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our
    current and future products. A failure to identify and take
    advantage of opportunities that allow us to increase our profit
    margins or a failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses
    or discontinue low profit margin products, may result in us
    failing to meet our financial targets and may otherwise have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

We are
    subject to risks associated with doing business
    globally.

Our operations, both inside and outside the United States, are
    subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and
    under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions
    and geographies. These risks include fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates, changes in exchange controls, loss of business
    in government tenders that are held annually in many cases,
    nationalization, increasingly complex labor environments,
    expropriation and other governmental actions, availability of
    raw materials, changes in taxation, including legislative
    changes in United States and international taxation of income
    earned outside of the United States, importation limitations,
    export control restrictions, changes in or violations of
    U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA, dependence on a few
    government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic
    and political destabilization or instability, disputes between
    countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual
    property, disruption or destruction of operations in a
    significant geographic region — due to the location of
    manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or
    customers — regardless of cause, including war,
    terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, or natural
    or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire,
    earthquake, storm or disease. Failure to comply with the laws
    and regulations that affect our global operations could have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
    of operations.

We are
    subject to foreign currency exchange risk.

In 2009, we generated approximately 60% of our revenue outside
    the United States. We anticipate that revenue from outside the
    United States will continue to represent a majority of our total
    revenue. As a result, our financial results may continue to be
    adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates. Market volatility and currency fluctuations may also
    reduce the benefits from our natural hedges and limit our
    ability to cost-effectively hedge against our foreign currency
    exposure. A discussion of the financial impact of foreign
    exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we
    attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the heading
    “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in Item 7 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these
    risks.

Challenges
    in the commercial and credit environment may adversely affect
    our business and financial condition.

The company’s ability to generate cash flows from
    operations could be affected if there is a material decline in
    the demand for the company’s products, in the solvency of
    its customers or suppliers, or deterioration in the
    company’s key financial ratios or credit rating. Current or
    worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business
    and the business of our customers, including their ability to
    pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on
    healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the
    demand for our products and services, longer sales cycles,
    slower adoption of new technologies and increased price
    competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain
    of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability
    to produce our products.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the
    consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

EXECUTIVE
    OVERVIEW

Description
    of the Company and Business Segments

Baxter International Inc. (Baxter or the company) develops,
    manufactures and markets products that save and sustain the
    lives of people with hemophilia, immune disorders, infectious
    diseases, kidney disease, trauma, and


other chronic and acute medical conditions. As a global,
    diversified healthcare company, Baxter applies a unique
    combination of expertise in medical devices, pharmaceuticals and
    biotechnology to create products that advance patient care
    worldwide. The company operates in three segments.

BioScience

processes recombinant and plasma-based proteins to treat
    hemophilia and other bleeding disorders; plasma-based therapies
    to treat immune deficiencies, alpha

1-antitrypsin

deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute
    blood-related conditions; products for regenerative medicine,
    such as biosurgery products; and vaccines.

Medication
    Delivery

manufactures intravenous (IV) solutions and
    administration sets, premixed drugs and drug-reconstitution
    systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for injectable drugs, IV
    nutrition products, infusion pumps, and inhalation anesthetics,
    as well as products and services related to pharmacy
    compounding, drug formulation and packaging technologies.

Renal

provides products to treat end-stage renal disease,
    or irreversible kidney failure. The business manufactures
    solutions and other products for peritoneal dialysis (PD), a
    home-based therapy, and also distributes products for
    hemodialysis (HD), which is generally conducted in a hospital or
    clinic.

Baxter has approximately 49,700 employees and conducts
    business in over 100 countries. The company generates
    approximately 60% of its revenues outside the United States, and
    maintains manufacturing and distribution facilities in a number
    of locations in the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia-Pacific
    and Latin America.

Financial
    Results

Baxter’s 2009 results reflect the company’s success in
    driving growth through global expansion and leveraging the
    benefits of its diversified healthcare model, while increasing
    its investment in research and development (R&D). In 2009,
    the company achieved record net sales, earnings and cash flows
    from operations.

Baxter’s global net sales totaled $12.6 billion in
    2009, an increase of 2% over 2008, and included an unfavorable
    foreign currency impact of 5 percentage points.
    International sales totaled $7.2 billion and represented
    approximately 60% of the company’s total sales in 2009.
    Contributing to the company’s increased sales was the
    BioScience segment growth, driven by increased demand and
    improved pricing for GAMMAGARD LIQUID (marketed as KIOVIG in
    most markets outside the United States), the liquid formulation
    of the company’s antibody-replacement therapy, IGIV (immune
    globulin intravenous), and certain other plasma protein
    products, and the continued increase in customer conversion to
    the company’s advanced recombinant therapy, ADVATE
    [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Plasma/Albumin-Free
    Method]. In the Medication Delivery segment, excluding the
    impact of foreign currency, growth in the company’s
    international pharmacy compounding and U.S. pharmaceutical
    partnering businesses contributed to the increase in sales,
    combined with increased demand for IV solutions and
    anesthesia products, including SUPRANE (desflurane) and
    sevoflurane, and increased demand and improved pricing for
    nutritional products. Also contributing to the increase in net
    sales, excluding the impact of foreign currency, were gains in
    the number of PD patients in the Renal segment, particularly in
    the United States, Latin America and Eastern Europe, with
    double-digit growth across Asia.

Baxter’s net income for 2009 totaled $2.2 billion, or
    $3.59 per diluted share, increasing 9% and 14%, respectively,
    compared to the prior year. The increase in earnings in 2009
    reflects the increased gross margin as a result of improved
    sales mix, manufacturing cost and yield improvements, as well as
    improved pricing. In 2009, R&D expenses totaled
    $917 million, a 6% increase over the prior year, and
    represented the highest level of R&D spending in the
    company’s history. As further discussed below, results of
    operations for 2009 included charges associated with the
    company’s SYNDEO PCA Syringe Pump and COLLEAGUE infusion
    pumps, the company’s cost optimization efforts, and the
    discontinuation of the company’s SOLOMIX drug delivery
    system in development. Results of operations for 2008 included
    charges associated with the company’s COLLEAGUE infusion
    pumps, the discontinuation of the CLEARSHOT pre-filled syringe
    program and acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D).

The company’s financial position remains strong, with cash
    flows from operations totaling $2.9 billion in 2009, an
    increase of $394 million over 2008. At December 31,
    2009, Baxter had $2.8 billion in cash and equivalents, and
    the company’s net debt (debt and lease obligations less
    cash and equivalents) represented 19% of shareholders’
    equity. In 2009, Baxter’s cash outflows relating to
    acquisitions of and investments in


businesses and technologies included a $100 million payment
    to Sigma International General Medical Apparatus, LLC (SIGMA)
    for the exclusive distribution of SIGMA’s infusion pumps in
    the United States and international markets, a 40 percent
    equity stake in SIGMA, and an option to purchase the remaining
    portion of SIGMA. Additionally, in 2009 the company acquired
    certain assets of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation related to
    the hemofiltration business, also known as Continuous Renal
    Replacement Therapy (Edwards CRRT), for $56 million.

Capital investments totaled $1.0 billion in 2009 as the
    company continues to invest in capacity across its businesses to
    support future growth. These investments were focused on
    projects that enhance the company’s cost structure and
    manufacturing capabilities across the three businesses,
    particularly as they relate to the company’s nutritional,
    anesthesia and PD products, and plasma and recombinant
    manufacturing platforms. In addition, the company continues to
    invest to support its strategy of geographic expansion with
    select investments in growing markets, and continues to invest
    to support the company’s ongoing strategic focus on
    R&D with the expansion of research facilities, pilot
    manufacturing sites and laboratories.

The company’s strong cash flow generation also provided the
    company with the flexibility to continue to return value to its
    shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
    During 2009, the company repurchased 23 million shares of
    common stock for $1.2 billion, and paid cash dividends to
    its shareholders totaling $632 million. The company
    increased the quarterly dividend rate by 20% in late 2008 and by
    an additional 12% in late 2009.

Strategic
    Objectives

Baxter remains focused on delivering sustainable growth and
    shareholder value, while making appropriate investments for the
    future. Baxter’s diversified healthcare model, its broad
    portfolio of products that treat life-threatening acute or
    chronic conditions, and its global presence are core components
    of the company’s strategy to achieve these objectives.
    Through continued innovation, investment and collaboration,
    Baxter seeks to advance new therapies, improve the safety and
    cost-effectiveness of treatments and expand access to care.

The company seeks to expand gross margins by improving product
    and business mix, pricing products appropriately, controlling
    costs and enhancing productivity throughout the company’s
    global manufacturing footprint. As part of its approach to
    disciplined financial management, Baxter is focused on
    controlling general and administrative costs while continuing to
    invest in select marketing programs and promotional activities
    directed toward higher-growth and higher-margin products.

Strong cash flows generated by Baxter’s core operations
    have allowed the company to increase its investment in its
    R&D pipeline. In 2009, the company advanced a number of
    Phase III clinical trials and numerous earlier stage
    clinical trials of therapies that have the potential to impact
    the treatment and delivery of care for chronic diseases like
    Alzheimer’s disease, hemophilia, end-stage renal disease
    and immune deficiencies, as well as public health threats like
    pandemic and seasonal influenza. Refer to the R&D section
    below for more information on these activities. In 2010, the
    company will continue to invest in its R&D pipeline and
    pursue select business development initiatives, collaborations
    and alliances as part of the execution of its long-term growth
    strategy.

The company’s ability to sustain long-term growth and
    successfully execute the strategies discussed above depends in
    part on the company’s ability to manage the competitive
    landscape, the current challenges in the commercial and credit
    environment, and other risk factors described under the caption
    “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the company’s
    Annual Report on

Foreign currency unfavorably impacted net sales by
    5 percentage points in 2009 due to the strengthening of the
    U.S. Dollar relative to other currencies, including the
    Euro and the British Pound. Foreign currency favorably impacted
    net sales growth by 4 percentage points in 2008 principally
    due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other
    currencies, including the Euro.

Net sales in the BioScience segment increased 5% and 14% in 2009
    and 2008, respectively (including an unfavorable foreign
    currency impact of 5 percentage points in 2009 and a
    favorable foreign currency impact of 3 percentage points in
    2008). Sales growth in the BioScience segment in both years was
    driven by increased demand across a majority of the product
    categories and improved pricing for select products. Sales
    growth in the Recombinants product category in both 2009 and
    2008 was the result of the continued adoption of the
    company’s advanced recombinant therapy, ADVATE. Strong
    demand for FEIBA (an anti-inhibitor coagulant complex) and
    plasma-derived factor VIII, and improved pricing and increased
    demand for albumin drove sales growth in the Plasma Proteins
    product category in both years. Also contributing to the 2009
    growth was increased market penetration in the United States of
    ARALAST [alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (human)]. Antibody Therapy
    product category sales growth in both years was the result of
    improved pricing and increased demand for GAMMAGARD LIQUID
    therapy. Also contributing to the sales growth in both years was
    increased demand for the company’s fibrin sealant product,
    FLOSEAL, in the Regenerative Medicine product category. Net
    sales in the company’s Other product category declined in
    both years. In 2009, the addition of international sales of
    CELVAPAN H1N1 pandemic vaccine and increased sales of NEISVAC-C
    (for the prevention of meningitis C) were more than offset
    by


lower international sales of FSME-IMMUN (a tick-borne
    encephalitis vaccine) and a reduction in pandemic influenza
    vaccine advance purchase agreements (APAs). In 2008, strong
    international sales of FSME-IMMUN and influenza vaccines,
    including approximately $50 million of revenue in 2008
    relating to a large pandemic influenza vaccine APA, were more
    than offset by the negative impact related to the transfer of
    marketing and distribution rights for BENEFIX back to Wyeth
    effective June 30, 2007. Sales of BENEFIX were
    approximately $110 million in 2007. On February 28,
    2007, the company sold substantially all of the assets and
    liabilities of the Transfusion Therapies (TT) business. Refer to
    Note 3 for additional information regarding the TT business.

Net sales in the Medication Delivery segment increased 2% and 8%
    in 2009 and 2008, respectively (including an unfavorable foreign
    currency impact of 5 percentage points in 2009 and a
    favorable foreign currency impact of 3 percentage points in
    2008). Excluding the impact of foreign currency, net sales in
    the IV Therapies product category grew in both years as a
    result of increased demand, particularly in international
    markets, and improved pricing in the United States, for IV
    solutions and nutritional products. Strong sales of select
    multi-source generic products and growth in the company’s
    international pharmacy compounding and U.S. pharmaceutical
    partnering businesses drove double-digit sales growth in the
    Global Injectables product category in 2009, excluding the
    impact of foreign currency. In 2008, strong international sales
    in the pharmacy compounding business were partially offset by
    decreased sales of generic injectables, primarily driven by the
    decline in generic propofol and heparin sales. The decline in
    generic propofol sales was due to the transfer of marketing and
    distribution rights for propofol back to Teva Pharmaceutical
    Industries Ltd. effective July 1, 2007. Sales of propofol
    totaled approximately $40 million in 2007. The decline in
    heparin sales was due to the company’s recall of heparin
    sodium injection products in the United States in 2008. Sales of
    these heparin products totaled approximately $30 million in
    2007. In the Infusion Systems product category, sales declined
    in 2009 as a result of lower revenues from disposable tubing
    sets used in the administration of IV solutions and lower
    international sales of COLLEAGUE infusion pumps, partially
    offset by sales of SPECTRUM infusion pumps as a result of the
    2009 distribution agreement with SIGMA. Sales growth in this
    product category in 2008 was due to increased international
    sales of COLLEAGUE infusion pumps and increased sales of
    disposable tubing sets. Growth in both 2009 and 2008 in the
    Anesthesia product category was driven by increased sales of
    SUPRANE (desflurane) and sevoflurane. The company continues to
    benefit from its position as the only global supplier of all
    three modern inhaled anesthetics (SUPRANE, sevoflurane and
    isoflurane). Refer to Note 4 for additional information on
    the SIGMA arrangement and Note 11 for additional
    information regarding heparin.

Net sales in the Renal segment decreased 2% in 2009 and
    increased 3% in 2008 (including an unfavorable foreign currency
    impact of 6 percentage points in 2009 and a favorable
    foreign currency impact of 5 percentage points in 2008).
    Excluding the impact of foreign currency, net sales in the PD
    Therapy product category grew in 2009 as the result of gains in
    the number of PD patients, particularly in the United States,
    Latin America and Eastern Europe, with double-digit growth
    across Asia. Penetration of PD Therapy products continues to be
    strong in emerging markets where many people with end-stage
    renal disease have historically been under-treated. Excluding
    the impact of foreign currency, net sales in the PD Therapy
    product category declined in 2008 as gains in the number of PD
    patients in Asia (particularly in China), Central and Eastern
    Europe and the United States were more than offset by the impact
    of a government tender loss in Mexico in the first quarter of
    2008. The 2008 impact of the lost Mexican tender was estimated
    to be approximately $100 million. Excluding the impact of
    foreign currency, net sales in the HD Therapy product category
    were flat in 2009 and declined in 2008 as lower saline sales in
    both years were offset in 2009 by sales related to the
    company’s acquisition of Edwards CRRT and, in 2008,
    partially offset by higher revenues from the company’s
    Renal Therapy Services (RTS) business, which operates dialysis
    centers in partnership with local physicians in select
    countries. Refer to Note 4 for additional information
    regarding the acquisition of Edwards CRRT.

Transition Services to Fenwal Inc.

Net sales
    in this category represent revenues associated with
    manufacturing, distribution and other services provided by the
    company to Fenwal Inc. (Fenwal) subsequent to the divestiture of
    the TT business on February 28, 2007. Revenues declined in
    2009 as certain of the transition services agreements terminated
    in 2008. See Note 3 for additional information regarding
    the TT business divestiture.

Gross
    Margin

The increase in gross margin in 2009 and 2008 was principally
    driven by improvements in sales mix across all three segments,
    manufacturing cost and yield improvements, as well as improved
    pricing for select products. Contributing to the gross margin
    improvement was the continued customer conversion to ADVATE
    therapy, increased demand and improved pricing for GAMMAGARD
    LIQUID therapy and certain other plasma protein and nutritional
    products; and increased demand for IV solutions, global
    injectables and anesthesia products. Partially offsetting the
    gross margin improvement was the unfavorable impact of lower
    FSME-IMMUN vaccine revenues.

Included in the company’s gross margin in 2009, 2008 and
    2007 were $27 million, $125 million and
    $14 million, respectively, of charges and other costs
    related to COLLEAGUE infusion pumps and the SYNDEO PCA Syringe
    Pump. Also included in gross margin in 2009 was $30 million
    of the company’s $79 million cost optimization charge
    recognized in the fourth quarter, which relates to actions the
    company is taking to optimize its overall cost structure on a
    global basis. These charges decreased the gross margin by
    approximately 0.5, 1.1 and 0.1 percentage points in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional
    information on these charges and costs.


Marketing
    and Administrative Expenses

The marketing and administrative expense ratio declined in 2009
    and 2008. The ratio in both years was favorably impacted by
    leverage from higher sales and stronger cost controls, partially
    offset by spending relating to new marketing programs.
    Unfavorably impacting the marketing and administrative expense
    ratio in 2009 was $49 million of the company’s
    $79 million cost optimization charge recognized in the
    fourth quarter, as discussed in Note 5. Foreign currency
    had an unfavorable impact on the marketing and administrative
    expense ratio in 2009 and a favorable impact in 2008. Also
    unfavorably impacting the marketing and administrative expense
    ratio in 2007 was a charge of $56 million to establish
    reserves related to the average wholesale pricing (AWP)
    litigation, as discussed in Note 11. These charges
    increased the marketing and administrative expense ratio by
    approximately 0.3 and 0.5 percentage points in 2009 and
    2007, respectively.

Pension
    Plan Costs

Fluctuations in pension plan costs impacted the company’s
    gross margin and expense ratios. Pension plan costs increased
    $18 million in 2009 and decreased $15 million in 2008,
    as detailed in Note 9. The $18 million increase in
    2009 was principally due to an increase in loss amortization
    related to asset performance and demographic experience,
    partially offset by the impact of the company’s
    contributions to its pension plans and higher interest rates
    used to discount the plans’ projected benefit obligations.
    The $15 million decrease in 2008 was principally due to an
    increase in the interest rate used to discount the plans’
    projected benefit obligations and lower loss amortization
    related to asset performance from prior years, partially offset
    by the impact of changes to certain other assumptions.

Costs of the company’s pension plans are expected to
    increase from $155 million in 2009 to approximately
    $176 million in 2010, principally due to lower interest
    rates used to discount the plans’ projected benefit
    obligations and an increase in loss amortization related to
    asset performance, partially offset by the impact of a
    $300 million discretionary cash contribution made to the
    pension plan in the United States in January 2010. Refer to the
    Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for further
    information on the funding of pension plans. For the domestic
    plans, the discount rate will decrease to 6.05% from 6.5% and
    the expected return on plan assets will remain at 8.5% for 2010.
    Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section below for a
    discussion of how the pension plan assumptions are developed,
    mortality tables are selected, and actuarial losses are
    amortized, and the impact of these factors on pension plan cost.

R&D expenses increased in both 2009 and 2008, reflecting
    the company’s continued focus on innovation and investments
    across its business portfolio to advance and expand its product
    pipeline. Foreign currency had a favorable impact on R&D
    expense growth in 2009 and an unfavorable impact in 2008.

In 2009, the company had a number of product launches and
    continued to make progress with respect to its internal R&D
    pipeline and R&D collaborations with partners. Key
    developments included the following:

R&D expenses in 2008 included IPR&D charges totaling
    $19 million principally related to an in-licensing
    agreement with Innocoll Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Innocoll).
    R&D expenses in 2007 included IPR&D charges totaling
    $50 million, related to a collaboration with HHD, LLC (HHD)
    and DEKA Products Limited Partnership and DEKA Research and
    Development Corp. (collectively, DEKA); arrangements with
    Halozyme; a distribution agreement with Nycomed Pharma AS
    (Nycomed); and an amendment of the company’s collaboration
    with Nektar Therapeutics (Nektar). Refer to Note 4 for more
    information regarding the 2008 agreement with Innocoll, as well
    as the investments made in 2007.

Restructuring
    Charge

In 2007, the company recorded a restructuring charge of
    $70 million principally associated with the consolidation
    of certain commercial and manufacturing operations outside of
    the United States. Based on a review of current and future
    capacity needs, the company decided to integrate several
    facilities to reduce the company’s cost structure and
    optimize operations, principally in the Medication Delivery
    segment. Refer to Note 5 for additional information,
    including details regarding reserve utilization.

Net
    Interest Expense

Net interest expense increased $22 million in 2009,
    principally due to the impact of lower interest rates on
    interest income. Also contributing to the increase in net
    interest expense in 2009 was the impact of a higher average net
    debt balance due to the February 2009 issuance of
    $350 million of senior unsecured notes due 2014 and the
    August 2009 issuance of $500 million of senior unsecured
    notes due 2019. Net interest expense increased $54 million
    in 2008, principally due to lower interest income resulting from
    lower U.S. interest rates and a lower average cash balance,
    a higher average debt balance and the termination of the
    company’s cross-currency swap agreements. The higher
    average debt balance in 2008 was principally due to the December
    2007 issuance of $500 million of senior unsecured notes due
    2037 and the May 2008 issuance of $500 million


of senior unsecured notes due 2018. Refer to Note 2 for a
    summary of the components of net interest expense for the three
    years ended December 31, 2009.

Other
    Expense, Net

Other expense, net was $45 million in 2009,
    $26 million in 2008 and $18 million in 2007. Refer to
    Note 2 for a table that details the components of other
    expense, net for the three years ended December 31, 2009.
    Other expense, net in each year included amounts relating to
    equity method investments and foreign currency fluctuations,
    principally relating to intercompany receivables, payables and
    loans denominated in a foreign currency. In 2009, other expense,
    net included a charge of $54 million associated with the
    discontinuation of the company’s SOLOMIX drug delivery
    system in development. In 2008, other expense, net included a
    charge of $31 million associated with the discontinuation
    of the company’s CLEARSHOT pre-filled syringe program and
    $16 million of income related to the finalization of the
    net assets transferred in the TT divestiture. In 2007, other
    expense, net included a gain on the sale of the TT business of
    $58 million less a charge of $35 million associated
    with severance and other employee-related costs. Refer to
    Note 3 for further information regarding the divestiture
    and Note 5 for further information on the SOLOMIX and
    CLEARSHOT charges.

Pre-Tax
    Income

Refer to Note 12 for a summary of financial results by
    segment. Certain items are maintained at the company’s
    corporate level and are not allocated to a segment. The
    following is a summary of significant factors impacting the
    segments’ financial results.

BioScience

Pre-tax income increased 5% in 2009
    and 21% in 2008. The primary drivers of the increase in pre-tax
    income in both years were continued gross margin expansion
    driven by strong sales of higher-margin products, fueled
    principally by the continued customer adoption of ADVATE therapy
    and increased demand and improved pricing for GAMMAGARD LIQUID
    therapy and certain other plasma protein products, as well as
    continued manufacturing improvements. Partially offsetting the
    growth in both years was increased R&D spending and, in
    2009, the unfavorable impact of lower FSME-IMMUN vaccine sales.
    Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact on 2009 growth and a
    favorable impact on 2008 growth.

Medication Delivery

Pre-tax income increased
    28% in 2009 and decreased 15% in 2008. Included in pre-tax
    income in 2009, 2008 and 2007, and impacting the earnings trend,
    were $27 million, $125 million and $14 million,
    respectively, of charges and other costs relating to the
    COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion pumps, as discussed above. Also
    included in the pre-tax income in 2009 was a $54 million
    charge related to the discontinuation of the company’s
    SOLOMIX drug delivery system in development. Included in pre-tax
    income in 2008 was a $31 million charge related to the
    discontinuation of the CLEARSHOT pre-filled syringe program.
    Aside from the impact of these items, pre-tax earnings in 2009
    and 2008 benefited from gross margin improvements resulting from
    favorable product mix, principally from increased sales of
    IV solutions, global injectables, anesthesia and
    nutritional products. Partially offsetting these increases in
    2008 were increased spending on R&D and the unfavorable
    impact of competition for the company’s generic products.
    Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact on growth in 2009 and
    a favorable impact on growth in 2008. Refer to Note 5 for
    further information on the infusion pump, SOLOMIX and CLEARSHOT
    charges.

Renal

Pre-tax income decreased 4% in 2009 and
    17% in 2008. The pre-tax earnings declined in both years
    principally due to increased R&D spending, including the
    development of home HD therapy, and in 2008, the loss of a PD
    tender in Mexico. The Renal segment’s revenues are
    generated principally outside the United States, and foreign
    currency had an unfavorable impact in 2009 and a favorable
    impact in 2008 to

pre-tax

income.

Other

As mentioned above, certain income and
    expense amounts are not allocated to a segment. These amounts
    are detailed in the table in Note 12 and include net
    interest expense, certain foreign exchange fluctuations
    (principally relating to intercompany receivables, payables and
    loans denominated in a foreign currency) and the majority of the
    foreign currency hedging activities, corporate headquarters
    costs, stock compensation expense, income and expense related to
    certain non-strategic investments, certain employee benefit plan
    costs, certain nonrecurring gains and losses, certain charges
    (such as cost optimization,


restructuring, certain litigation-related and certain IPR&D
    charges), and the revenues and costs related to the
    manufacturing, distribution and other transition agreements with
    Fenwal.

Refer to the previous discussions for further information
    regarding net interest expense, the cost optimization and
    restructuring charges, IPR&D charges, the charge associated
    with the AWP litigation, the net divestiture gain and ongoing
    arrangements with Fenwal related to the sale of the TT business
    and Note 8 for further information regarding stock
    compensation expense.

Income
    Taxes

Effective
    Income Tax Rate

The effective income tax rate was 19% in 2009, 18% in 2008 and
    19% in 2007. The company anticipates that the effective income
    tax rate, calculated in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles (GAAP), will be approximately 19% to 19.5%
    in 2010, excluding any impact from additional audit developments
    or other special items.

The company’s effective tax rate differs from the
    U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain
    operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local
    taxes and foreign taxes that are different than the
    U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition, as discussed
    further below, the company’s effective income tax rate can
    be impacted in each year by discrete factors or events. Refer to
    Note 10 for further information regarding the
    company’s income taxes.


The effective tax rate for 2009 was impacted by greater income
    in jurisdictions with higher tax rates, partially offset by
    $51 million of income tax benefit from planning that
    accessed foreign tax losses.


The effective tax rate for 2008 was impacted by $29 million
    of valuation allowance reductions on net operating loss
    carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions due to profitability
    improvements, $8 million of income tax benefit related to
    the extension of R&D tax credits in the United States and
    $14 million of additional U.S. income tax expense
    related to foreign earnings which are no longer considered
    indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States because the
    company planned to remit these earnings to the United States in
    the foreseeable future.


The effective tax rate for 2007 was impacted by a
    $38 million net reduction of the valuation allowance on net
    operating loss carryforwards primarily due to profitability
    improvements in a foreign jurisdiction, a $12 million
    reduction in tax expense due to legislation reducing corporate
    income tax rates in Germany, the extension of tax incentives,
    and the settlement of tax audits in jurisdictions outside of the
    United States. Partially offsetting these items was
    $82 million of U.S. income tax expense related to
    foreign earnings which are no longer considered permanently
    reinvested outside of the United States because the company
    planned to remit these earnings to the United States in the
    foreseeable future.

Uncertain
    Tax Positions

Baxter expects to reduce the amount of its liability for
    uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months by
    $302 million due principally to the expiration of certain
    statutes of limitations related to tax benefits recorded in
    respect of losses from restructuring certain international
    operations and the settlements of certain multi-jurisdictional
    transfer pricing issues. While the final outcome of these
    matters is inherently uncertain, the company believes it has
    made adequate tax provisions for all years subject to
    examination.

Income
    and Earnings per Diluted Share Amounts

Net income attributable to Baxter was $2.2 billion in 2009,
    $2.0 billion in 2008 and $1.7 billion in 2007. The
    corresponding net earnings per diluted share were $3.59 in 2009,
    $3.16 in 2008 and $2.61 in 2007. The significant factors and
    events causing the net changes from 2008 to 2009 and from 2007
    to 2008 are discussed above.


LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash
    Flows from Operations

Cash flows from operations increased in both 2009 and 2008,
    totaling $2.9 billion in 2009, $2.5 billion in 2008
    and $2.3 billion in 2007. The increases in cash flows in
    2009 and 2008 were primarily due to higher earnings (before
    non-cash items) and the other factors discussed below. Included
    in cash flows from operations were outflows of $96 million
    in 2009 and $112 million in 2008 related to realized excess
    tax benefits from stock issued under employee benefit plans.
    Realized excess tax benefits are required to be presented in the
    consolidated statements of cash flows as an outflow within the
    operating section and an inflow within the financing section.

Accounts
    Receivable

Cash outflows relating to accounts receivable increased in 2009
    and decreased in 2008. Days sales outstanding increased from
    50.6 days at December 31, 2008 to 51.2 days at
    December 31, 2009, primarily due to the geographic mix of
    sales, an increase in collection periods in certain
    international locations and a decrease in factoring of
    receivables, partially offset by improved collection periods in
    the United States. The decrease in cash outflows from accounts
    receivables in 2008 was primarily due to an improvement in the
    collection of receivables in the United States and in certain
    international locations.

Inventories

Cash outflows from inventories decreased in 2009 and 2008. The
    following is a summary of inventories at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, as well as inventory turns for 2009, 2008 and 2007, by
    segment. Inventory turns for the year are calculated as the
    annualized fourth quarter cost of sales divided by the year-end
    inventory balance.

Inventories increased $196 million in 2009, with more than
    half of the increase related to the impact of foreign currency.
    The higher inventory turns for the total company were
    principally due to increased sales in the Medication Delivery
    segment, partially offset by an increase in plasma-related
    inventories in the BioScience segment.

Other

Cash flows related to liabilities, restructuring payments and
    other increased in 2009. This increase was principally driven by
    the timing of payments of trade accounts payable and income
    taxes payable, partially offset by contributions to the
    company’s pension plans of $170 million in 2009
    compared to $287 million in 2008. Cash flows decreased in
    2008 principally due to contributions to the company’s
    pension plans, the timing of payments of trade accounts payable
    and income taxes payable, and increased payments related to the
    company’s restructuring programs. Included in both 2008 and
    2007 were cash outflows related to the settlement of mirror
    cross-currency swaps, which resulted in operating cash inflows
    of $12 million in 2008 compared to $31 million of cash
    outflows in 2007. There were no settlements of cross-currency
    swaps during 2009.

Cash
    Flows from Investing Activities

Capital
    Expenditures

Capital expenditures totaled $1.0 billion in 2009,
    $954 million in 2008 and $692 million in 2007. The
    investments in 2009 were focused on projects that enhance the
    company’s cost structure and manufacturing


capabilities across the three businesses, particularly as it
    relates to the company’s nutritional, anesthesia and PD
    products and plasma and recombinant manufacturing platforms. In
    addition, the company continues to invest to support its
    strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in
    growing markets, and continues to invest to support the
    company’s ongoing strategic focus on R&D with the
    expansion of research facilities, pilot manufacturing sites and
    laboratories.

The company makes investments in capital expenditures at a level
    sufficient to support the strategic and operating needs of the
    businesses, and continues to improve capital allocation
    discipline in making investments to enhance long-term growth.
    The company expects to invest approximately $1 billion in
    capital expenditures in 2010.

Acquisitions
    of and Investments in Businesses and Technologies

Net cash outflows relating to acquisitions of and investments in
    businesses and technologies were $156 million in 2009,
    $99 million in 2008 and $112 million in 2007. The cash
    outflows in 2009 principally related to a $100 million
    payment for the exclusive distribution of SIGMA’s infusion
    pumps in the United States and international markets, a
    40 percent equity stake in SIGMA and an option to purchase
    the remaining portion of SIGMA. Additionally, in 2009 the
    company acquired Edwards CRRT, for $56 million. The cash
    outflows in 2008 principally related to an IV solutions
    business in China, the company’s in-licensing agreement to
    market and distribute Innocoll’s gentamicin surgical
    implant in the United States, the acquisition of certain
    technology applicable to the BioScience business, payments
    related to the company’s agreements with Nycomed and
    Nektar, and certain smaller acquisitions and investments. The
    cash outflows in 2007 principally related to a new arrangement
    and the expansion of the company’s existing agreements with
    Halozyme and the company’s collaboration with DEKA. Refer
    to Note 4 for further information regarding these
    investments.

Divestitures
    and Other

Net cash inflows relating to divestitures and other activities
    were $24 million in 2009, $60 million in 2008 and
    $499 million in 2007. Cash inflows in 2009 and 2008
    principally consisted of cash collections from customers
    relating to previously securitized receivables under the
    company’s European receivables securitization facility. In
    2007, the company purchased the third party interest in
    previously sold receivables under the facility, resulting in net
    cash outflows of $157 million. Cash inflows in 2007
    included $421 million of cash proceeds from the divestiture
    of the TT business. The $421 million represented the
    $473 million total cash received upon divestiture less the
    $52 million prepayment related to the manufacturing,
    distribution and other transition agreements, which was
    classified in the operating section of the consolidated
    statement of cash flows. Cash inflows in 2009, 2008 and 2007
    also included normal collections on retained interests
    associated with securitization arrangements.

Cash
    Flows from Financing Activities

Debt
    Issuances, Net of Payments of Obligations

Debt issuances, net of payments of obligations, were net inflows
    totaling $473 million in 2009 compared to net outflows
    totaling $79 million in 2008 and $51 million in 2007.
    Included in these totals in 2008 and 2007 were $540 million
    and $303 million, respectively, of cash outflows related to
    the settlement of cross-currency swap agreements, resulting in
    the termination of the company’s remaining net investment
    hedges. There were no settlements of cross-currency swap
    agreements in 2009.

The company issued $350 million of senior unsecured notes,
    which mature in March 2014 and bear a 4.0% coupon rate in
    February 2009 and $500 million of senior unsecured notes,
    which mature in August 2019 and bear a 4.5% coupon rate in
    August 2009. In May 2008, the company issued $500 million
    of senior unsecured notes, maturing in June 2018 and bearing a
    5.375% coupon rate. In addition, during 2008, the company issued
    commercial paper, of which $200 million was outstanding as
    of December 31, 2008, with a weighted-average interest rate
    of 2.55%. In December 2007, the company issued $500 million
    of senior unsecured notes, maturing in December 2037 and bearing
    a 6.25% coupon rate. The net proceeds from these issuances were
    used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of
    $200 million of outstanding commercial paper in 2009 and
    for the settlement of cross-currency swaps in 2008. In 2009, the
    company repaid approximately $160 million of outstanding
    borrowings related to the company’s Euro-denominated credit
    facility (further


discussed below). The company repaid its 5.196% notes,
    which approximated $250 million, upon their maturity in
    February 2008.

Other
    Financing Activities

Cash dividend payments totaled $632 million in 2009,
    $546 million in 2008 and $704 million in 2007.
    Beginning in 2007, the company converted from an annual to a
    quarterly dividend and increased the dividend by 15% on an
    annualized basis, to $0.1675 per share per quarter. The cash
    dividend payments in 2007 included the payments of the 2006
    annual dividend and three 2007 quarterly dividends. In November
    2007, the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of
    $0.2175 per share ($0.87 per share on an annualized basis),
    representing an increase of 30% over the previous quarterly
    rate. In November 2008, the board of directors declared a
    quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share ($1.04 per share on an
    annualized basis), representing an increase of 20% over the
    previous quarterly rate of $0.2175 per share. In November 2009,
    the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.29
    per share ($1.16 per share on an annualized basis), which was
    paid on January 5, 2010 to shareholders of record as of
    December 10, 2009. This dividend represented an increase of
    12% over the previous quarterly rate of $0.26 per share.

Proceeds and realized excess tax benefits from stock issued
    under employee benefit plans totaled $381 million in 2009,
    $680 million in 2008 and $639 million in 2007. The
    decrease in 2009 was due to a decrease in stock option
    exercises. The increase in 2008 was primarily due to increased
    participation in the company’s employee stock purchase plan
    and an increase in realized excess tax benefits from stock
    issued under employee benefit plans partially offset by a
    decrease in stock option exercises.

As authorized by the board of directors, the company repurchases
    its stock from time to time depending on the company’s cash
    flows, net debt level and market conditions. The company
    purchased 23 million shares for $1.2 billion in 2009,
    32 million shares for $2.0 billion in 2008 and
    34 million shares for $1.9 billion in 2007. In March
    2008, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to
    $2.0 billion of the company’s common stock. There is
    no remaining availability under the March 2008 authorization as
    of December 31, 2009. In July 2009, the board of directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to an additional
    $2.0 billion of the company’s common stock. At
    December 31, 2009, $1.95 billion remained available
    under the July 2009 authorization.

Credit
    Facilities, Access to Capital, Credit Ratings and Net Investment
    Hedges

Credit
    Facilities

The company’s primary revolving credit facility has a
    maximum capacity of $1.5 billion and matures in December
    2011. The company also maintains a Euro-denominated credit
    facility with a maximum capacity of approximately
    $435 million at December 31, 2009, which matures in
    January 2013. As of December 31, 2008, there was
    $164 million outstanding under the Euro-denominated credit
    facility, with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.4%. In
    2009, the company repaid the outstanding Euro-denominated credit
    facility borrowings. As of December 31, 2009, there were no
    outstanding borrowings under either of the two outstanding
    facilities. The company’s facilities enable the company to
    borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates,
    and contain various covenants, including a maximum
    net-debt-to-capital ratio. At December 31, 2009, the
    company was in compliance with the financial covenants in these
    agreements. The non-performance of any financial institution
    supporting either of the credit facilities would reduce the
    maximum capacity of these facilities by each institution’s
    respective commitment. The company also maintains other credit
    arrangements, as described in Note 6.

Access to
    Capital

The company intends to fund short-term and long-term obligations
    as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from
    operations or by issuing additional debt or common stock. The
    company had $2.8 billion of cash and equivalents at
    December 31, 2009. The company invests its excess cash in
    certificates of deposit and money market funds, and diversifies
    the concentration of cash among different financial institutions.


The company’s ability to generate cash flows from
    operations, issue debt or enter into other financing
    arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if
    there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s
    products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers,
    deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or
    credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in
    conditions. However, the company believes it has sufficient
    financial flexibility in the future to issue debt, enter into
    other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on
    acceptable terms to support the company’s growth objectives.

While the current economic downturn has not meaningfully
    impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables, the
    company continues to do business with certain foreign
    governments which have recently experienced credit rating
    downgrades and may become unable to pay for the company’s
    products or services.

There were no changes to the company’s credit ratings in
    2009.

If Baxter’s credit ratings or outlooks were to be
    downgraded, the company’s financing costs related to its
    credit arrangements and any future debt issuances could be
    unfavorably impacted. However, any future credit rating
    downgrade or change in outlook would not affect the
    company’s ability to draw on its credit facilities, and
    would not result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities
    of any of the company’s outstanding debt, unless, with
    respect to certain debt instruments, preceded by a change in
    control of the company.

Net
    Investment Hedges

In 2008, the company terminated its remaining net investment
    hedge portfolio and no longer has any outstanding net investment
    hedges. The company historically hedged the net assets of
    certain of its foreign operations using a combination of foreign
    currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps. In 2004, the
    company reevaluated its net investment hedge strategy and
    elected to reduce the use of these instruments as a risk
    management tool. As part of the change in strategy the company
    executed offsetting, or mirror, cross-currency swaps relating to
    over half of the existing portfolio that effectively fixed the
    net amount that the company would ultimately pay to settle the
    cross-currency swap agreements subject to this strategy. The net
    after-tax losses related to net investment hedge instruments
    recorded in other comprehensive income were $33 million and
    $48 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

When the cross-currency swaps are settled, the cash flows are
    reported within the financing section of the consolidated
    statement of cash flows. When the mirror swaps are settled, the
    cash flows are reported in the operating section of the
    consolidated statement of cash flows. Of the $528 million
    of net settlement payments in 2008, $540 million of cash
    outflows were included in the financing section and
    $12 million of cash inflows were included in the operating
    section. Of the $334 million of settlement payments in
    2007, $303 million of cash outflows were included in the
    financing section and $31 million of cash outflows were
    included in the operating section.


Contractual
    Obligations

As of December 31, 2009, the company had contractual
    obligations (excluding accounts payable, accrued liabilities
    (other than the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits)
    and contingent liabilities) payable or maturing in the following
    periods.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Baxter periodically enters into off-balance sheet arrangements
    where economical and consistent with the company’s business
    strategy. Certain contingencies arise in the normal course of
    business, and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet
    in accordance with GAAP (such as contingent joint development
    and commercialization arrangement payments). Also, upon
    resolution of uncertainties, the company may incur


charges in excess of presently established liabilities for
    certain matters (such as contractual indemnifications). The
    following is a summary of significant off-balance sheet
    arrangements and contingencies.

Receivable
    Securitizations

Where economical, the company has entered into agreements with
    various financial institutions in which the entire interest in
    and ownership of the receivable is sold, principally consisting
    of trade receivables originated in Japan. The company had also
    entered into agreements in which undivided interests in certain
    pools of receivables were sold, principally consisting of
    hardware lease receivables originated in the United States and
    trade receivables originated in Europe. Refer to Note 7 for
    a description of these arrangements. The Japanese securitization
    arrangement includes limited recourse provisions, which are not
    material to the consolidated financial statements.

Joint
    Development and Commercialization Arrangements

In the normal course of business, Baxter enters into joint
    development and commercialization arrangements with third
    parties, sometimes with companies in which the company has
    invested. The arrangements vary but generally provide that
    Baxter will receive certain rights to manufacture, market or
    distribute a specified technology or product under development
    in exchange for up-front payments and contingent payments
    relating to the achievement of specified pre-clinical, clinical,
    regulatory approval or sales milestones. At December 31,
    2009, the unfunded milestone payments under these arrangements
    totaled $812 million. This total excludes any contingent
    royalties. Based on the company’s projections, any
    contingent payments made in the future will be more than offset
    over time by the estimated net future cash flows relating to the
    rights acquired for those payments. The majority of the
    contingent payments relate to arrangements in the BioScience
    segment. Refer to Note 6 for further information.

Indemnifications

During the normal course of business, Baxter makes indemnities,
    commitments and guarantees pursuant to which the company may be
    required to make payments related to specific transactions.
    Indemnifications include: (i) intellectual property
    indemnities to customers in connection with the use, sale or
    license of products and services; (ii) indemnities to
    customers in connection with losses incurred while performing
    services on their premises; (iii) indemnities to vendors
    and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence
    or willful misconduct; and (iv) indemnities involving the
    representations and warranties in certain contracts. In
    addition, under Baxter’s Amended and Restated Certificate
    of Incorporation, and consistent with Delaware General
    Corporation Law, the company has agreed to indemnify its
    directors and officers for certain losses and expenses upon the
    occurrence of prescribed events. The majority of these
    indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any
    limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that the
    company could be obligated to make. To help address some these
    risks, the company maintains various insurance coverages. Based
    on historical experience and evaluation of the agreements, the
    company does not believe that any significant payments related
    to its indemnifications will result, and therefore the company
    has not recorded any associated liabilities.

Legal
    Contingencies

Refer to Note 11 for a discussion of the company’s
    legal contingencies. Upon resolution of any of these
    uncertainties, the company may incur charges in excess of
    presently established liabilities. While the liability of the
    company in connection with the claims cannot be estimated with
    any certainty, and although the resolution in any reporting
    period of one or more of these matters could have a significant
    impact on the company’s results of operations and cash
    flows for that period, the outcome of these legal proceedings is
    not expected to have a material adverse effect on the
    company’s consolidated financial position. While the
    company believes that it has valid defenses in these matters,
    litigation is inherently uncertain, excessive verdicts do occur,
    and the company may in the future incur material judgments or
    enter into material settlements of claims.


Funding
    of Pension and Other Postemployment Benefit Plans

The company’s funding policy for its pension plans is to
    contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding
    requirements, plus any additional amounts that the company may
    determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the
    plans, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the
    company and other factors. Volatility in the global financial
    markets could have an unfavorable impact on future funding
    requirements. The company is not legally obligated to fund its
    principal plans in the United States and Puerto Rico in 2010.
    The company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any
    discretionary contributions. The company expects to make cash
    contributions to its pension plans of at least $335 million
    in 2010, which includes a $300 million discretionary cash
    contribution made to its pension plan in the United States in
    January 2010. The company expects to have net cash outflows
    relating to its other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plan of
    approximately $25 million in 2010.

The table below details the funded status percentage of the
    company’s pension plans as of December 31, 2009,
    including certain plans that are unfunded in accordance with the
    guidelines of the company’s funding policy outlined above.
    The table excludes the $300 million discretionary cash
    contribution made to the pension plan in the United States in
    January 2010. Refer to Note 9 for further information.

    minimum funding requirements in the future.

Insurance
    Coverage

The company discontinued its practice of buying product
    liability insurance coverage effective May 1, 2007. The
    unavailability of insurance coverage with meaningful limits at a
    reasonable cost reflects current trends in product liability
    insurance for healthcare manufacturing companies generally. The
    company continues to evaluate available coverage levels and
    costs as market conditions change. The company’s net income
    and cash flows may be adversely affected in the future as a
    result of losses sustained.

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK

The company operates on a global basis, and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and shareholders’ equity
    could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange
    and interest rates. The company’s hedging policy attempts
    to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the
    company’s judgment of the appropriate trade-off between
    risk, opportunity and costs. Refer to Note 7 for further
    information regarding the company’s financial instruments
    and hedging strategies.

Currency
    Risk

The company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with
    respect to recognized assets and liabilities, forecasted
    transactions and net assets denominated in the Euro, Japanese
    Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar,
    Brazilian Real and Colombian Peso. The company manages its
    foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows
    the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural
    offsets. In addition, the company uses derivative and
    nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net
    exposure to foreign exchange. Gains and losses on the hedging
    instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions
    and reduce the earnings and shareholders’ equity volatility
    relating to foreign exchange. Financial market and currency
    volatility may reduce the benefits of the company’s natural
    hedges and limit the company’s ability to cost-effectively
    hedge these exposures.

The company uses options, forwards and cross-currency swaps to
    hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to
    forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and
    recognized assets and liabilities. The maximum term over which
    the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to
    forecasted


transactions at December 31, 2009 is 12 months. The
    company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain
    intercompany and third-party receivables and payables and debt
    denominated in foreign currencies. The company historically
    hedged certain of its net investments in international
    affiliates, using a combination of debt denominated in foreign
    currencies and cross-currency swap agreements. As further
    discussed in Note 7, in 2008, the company terminated all of
    its remaining net investment hedges.

Currency restrictions enacted in Venezuela require Baxter to
    obtain approval from the Venezuelan government to exchange
    Venezuelan Bolivars for U.S. Dollars and requires such
    exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by
    the government. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan
    government devalued the official exchange rate of 2.15 relative
    to the U.S. Dollar. The official exchange rate for imported
    goods classified as essential, such as food and medicine, was
    changed to 2.6, while the rate for payments for

non-essential

goods was changed to 4.3. The company expects that the majority
    of its products imported into Venezuela will be classified as
    essential goods and qualify for the 2.6 rate. The 4.3 rate was
    used for the translation of the company’s Venezuelan
    subsidiary at December 31, 2009, because this is the rate
    at which dividends are expected to be remitted if and when such
    dividends are approved by the Venezuelan government. As of
    January 1, 2010, Venezuela has been designated as a highly
    inflationary economy under GAAP and as a result, the functional
    currency of the company’s subsidiary in Venezuela will be
    the U.S. Dollar. The devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar
    and designation of Venezuela as highly inflationary is not
    expected to have a material impact on the financial results of
    the company. As of December 31, 2009, the company’s
    subsidiary in Venezuela had net assets of $20 million
    denominated in the Venezuelan Bolivar. In 2009, net sales in
    Venezuela represented less than 1% of Baxter’s total net
    sales.

As part of its risk-management program, the company performs
    sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair
    value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to
    hypothetical and reasonably possible near-term movements in
    foreign exchange rates.

A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign
    exchange option, forward and cross-currency swap contracts
    outstanding at December 31, 2009, while not predictive in
    nature, indicated that if the U.S. Dollar uniformly
    fluctuated unfavorably by 10% against all currencies, on a

net-of-tax

basis, the net liability balance of $69 million with
    respect to those contracts, which principally related to a hedge
    of U.S. Dollar-denominated debt issued by a foreign
    subsidiary, would increase by $69 million. A similar
    analysis performed with respect to option and forward contracts
    outstanding at December 31, 2008 indicated that, on a

net-of-tax

basis, the net asset balance of $40 million would decrease
    by $65 million, resulting in a net liability position.

The sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of
    the foreign exchange option, forward and cross-currency swap
    contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009 by replacing the
    actual exchange rates at December 31, 2009 with exchange
    rates that are 10% unfavorable to the actual exchange rates for
    each applicable currency. All other factors are held constant.
    These sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that
    currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that
    gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from
    another currency. The analyses also disregard the offsetting
    change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and
    balances.

Interest
    Rate and Other Risks

The company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and
    cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in
    interest rates. The company’s policy is to manage interest
    costs using a mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt that the
    company believes is appropriate. To manage this mix in a
    cost-efficient manner, the company periodically enters into
    interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at
    specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating
    interest amounts calculated by reference to an

agreed-upon

notional amount. The company also periodically uses
    forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to
    hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in
    interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt.

As part of its risk management program, the company performs
    sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in
    earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates. A
    52 basis-point increase in interest


rates (approximately 10% of the company’s weighted-average
    interest rate during 2009) affecting the company’s
    financial instruments, including debt obligations and related
    derivatives, would have an immaterial effect on the
    company’s 2009, 2008 and 2007 earnings and on the fair
    value of the company’s fixed-rate debt as of the end of
    each fiscal year.

As discussed in Note 7, the fair values of the
    company’s long-term litigation liabilities and related
    insurance receivables were computed by discounting the expected
    cash flows based on currently available information. A 10%
    movement in the assumed discount rate would have an immaterial
    effect on the fair values of those assets and liabilities.

With respect to the company’s investments in affiliates,
    the company believes any reasonably possible near-term losses in
    earnings, cash flows and fair values would not be material to
    the company’s consolidated financial position.

CHANGES
    IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Business
    Combinations

On January 1, 2009, the company adopted a new accounting
    standard which changes the accounting for business combinations
    in a number of significant respects. The key changes include the
    expansion of transactions that qualify as business combinations,
    the capitalization of IPR&D as an indefinite-lived asset,
    the recognition of certain acquired contingent assets and
    liabilities at fair value, the expensing of acquisition costs,
    the expensing of costs associated with restructuring the
    acquired company, the recognition of contingent consideration at
    fair value on the acquisition date, the recognition of
    post-acquisition date changes in deferred tax asset valuation
    allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties as income tax
    expense or benefit, and the expansion of disclosure
    requirements. This standard was applicable for acquisitions made
    by the company on or after January 1, 2009, including the
    April 2009 consolidation of SIGMA and the August 2009
    acquisition of certain assets of Edwards CRRT. Refer to
    Note 4 for further information regarding SIGMA and Edwards
    CRRT.

Noncontrolling
    Interests

On January 1, 2009, the company adopted a new accounting
    standard which changes the accounting and reporting of
    noncontrolling interests (historically referred to as minority
    interests). The standard requires that noncontrolling interests
    be presented in the consolidated balance sheets within equity,
    but separate from Baxter shareholders’ equity, and that the
    amount of consolidated net income attributable to Baxter and to
    the noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented
    in the consolidated statements of income. Any losses in excess
    of the noncontrolling interest’s equity interest continue
    to be allocated to the noncontrolling interest. Purchases or
    sales of equity interests that do not result in a change of
    control are accounted for as equity transactions. Upon a loss of
    control the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, is
    measured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in
    earnings. In partial acquisitions, when control is obtained,
    100% of the assets and liabilities, including goodwill, are
    recognized at fair value as if the entire target company had
    been acquired. The new standard was applied prospectively as of
    January 1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure
    requirements, which have been applied retrospectively for prior
    periods presented. Prior to the adoption of the new standard,
    the noncontrolling interests’ share of net income was
    included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of
    income and the noncontrolling interests’ equity was
    included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated
    balance sheets. The accounting related provisions of the new
    accounting standard did not have a material impact on the
    consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued two updates to the Accounting Standards Codification
    related to revenue recognition. The first update eliminates the
    requirement that all undelivered elements in an arrangement with
    multiple deliverables have objective and reliable evidence of
    fair value before revenue can be recognized for items that have
    been delivered. The update also no longer allows


use of the residual method when allocating consideration to
    deliverables. Instead, arrangement consideration is to be
    allocated to deliverables using the relative selling price
    method, applying a selling price hierarchy. Vendor specific
    objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price should be used if it
    exists. Otherwise, third party evidence (TPE) of selling price
    should be used. If neither VSOE nor TPE is available, the
    company’s best estimate of selling price should be used.
    The second update eliminates tangible products from the scope of
    software revenue recognition guidance when the tangible products
    contain software components and non-software components that
    function together to deliver the tangible products’
    essential functionality. Both updates require expanded
    qualitative and quantitative disclosures and are effective for
    fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with
    prospective application for new or materially modified
    arrangements or retrospective application permitted. Early
    adoption is permitted. The same transition method and period of
    adoption must be used for both updates. The company adopted
    these updates in 2009, prospectively applying them to
    arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after
    January 1, 2009. The early adoption of these updates did
    not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated
    financial statements and did not result in a change in its
    previously reported quarterly consolidated financial statements.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
    requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect
    the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses. A summary of the company’s significant accounting
    policies is included in Note 1. Certain of the
    company’s accounting policies are considered critical
    because these policies are the most important to the depiction
    of the company’s financial statements and require
    significant, difficult or complex judgments by the company,
    often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of
    matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results that
    differ from the company’s estimates could have an
    unfavorable effect on the company’s results of operations
    and financial position. The company applies estimation
    methodologies consistently from year to year. Other than changes
    required due to the issuance of new accounting pronouncements,
    there have been no significant changes in the company’s
    application of its critical accounting policies during 2009. The
    company’s critical accounting policies have been reviewed
    with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The
    following is a summary of accounting policies that the company
    considers critical to the consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition and Related Provisions and Allowances

The company’s policy is to recognize revenues from product
    sales and services when earned. Specifically, revenue is
    recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    delivery has occurred (or services have been rendered), the
    price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably
    assured. The shipping terms for the majority of the
    company’s revenue arrangements are FOB destination. The
    recognition of revenue is delayed if there are significant
    post-delivery obligations, such as training, installation or
    other services.

The company sometimes enters into arrangements in which it
    commits to delivering multiple products or services to its
    customers. In these cases, total arrangement consideration is
    allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling
    prices. Then the allocated consideration is recognized as
    revenue in accordance with the principles described above.
    Selling prices are determined by applying a selling price
    hierarchy. Selling prices are determined using VSOE, if it
    exists. Otherwise, selling prices are determined using TPE. If
    neither VSOE nor TPE is available, the company uses its best
    estimate of selling prices.

Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, chargebacks to
    wholesalers, and returns are provided for at the time the
    related sales are recorded, and are reflected as a reduction of
    sales. These estimates are reviewed periodically and, if
    necessary, revised, with any revisions recognized immediately as
    adjustments to sales.

The company periodically and systematically evaluates the
    collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the
    appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts. In determining the
    amount of the reserve, the company considers historical credit
    losses, the past-due status of receivables, payment history and
    other customer-specific information, and any other relevant
    factors or considerations. Because of the nature of the
    company’s customer base and the company’s credit and
    collection policies and procedures, write-offs of accounts
    receivable have historically not been significant (generally
    less than 2% of gross receivables).


The company also provides for the estimated costs that may be
    incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both
    probable and reasonably estimable, which is at the time the
    related revenue is recognized. The cost is determined based on
    actual company experience for the same or similar products as
    well as other relevant information. Estimates of future costs
    under the company’s warranty programs could change based on
    developments in the future. The company is not able to estimate
    the probability or amount of any future developments that could
    impact the reserves, but believes presently established reserves
    are adequate.

Pension
    and OPEB Plans

The company provides pension and other postemployment benefits
    to certain of its employees. These employee benefit expenses are
    reported in the same line items in the consolidated income
    statement as the applicable employee’s compensation
    expense. The valuation of the funded status and net benefit cost
    for the plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. These
    assumptions are reviewed annually, and revised if appropriate.
    The significant assumptions include the following:

•

interest rates used to discount pension and OPEB plan
    liabilities;

•

the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets;

•

rates of increases in employee compensation (used in estimating
    liabilities);

•

anticipated future healthcare costs (used in estimating the OPEB
    plan liability); and

•

other assumptions involving demographic factors such as
    retirement, mortality and turnover (used in estimating
    liabilities).

Selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both short-term
    and long-term historical trends and known economic and market
    conditions at the time of the valuation (also called the
    measurement date). The use of different assumptions would result
    in different measures of the funded status and net cost. Actual
    results in the future could differ from expected results. The
    company is not able to estimate the probability of actual
    results differing from expected results, but believes its
    assumptions are appropriate.

The company’s key assumptions are listed in Note 9.
    The most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering
    U.S. and Puerto Rico employees, because these plans are the
    most significant to the company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Discount
    Rate Assumption

For the U.S. and Puerto Rico plans, at the measurement date
    (December 31, 2009), the company used a discount rate of
    6.05% and 5.95% to measure its benefit obligations for the
    pension plans and OPEB plan, respectively. This discount rate
    will be used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for
    these plans for 2010. The company used a broad population of
    approximately 260 Aa-rated corporate bonds as of
    December 31, 2009 to determine the discount rate
    assumption. All bonds were denominated in U.S. dollars,
    with a minimum amount outstanding of $50 million. This
    population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of over
    500 Moody’s Aa rated, non-callable (or callable with
    make-whole provisions) bonds by eliminating the top
    10th percentile and bottom 40th percentile to adjust
    for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds Baxter
    would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its
    pension and OPEB plan liabilities. This portfolio of bonds was
    used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve,
    to discount the projected benefit payments for the U.S. and
    Puerto Rico plans. The discount rate is the single level rate
    that produces the same result as the spot rate curve.

For plans in Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the Eurozone,
    the company uses a method essentially the same as that described
    for the U.S. and Puerto Rico plans. For the company’s
    other international plans, the discount rate is generally
    determined by reviewing country- and region-specific government
    and corporate bond interest rates.

To understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension
    and OPEB plan cost, the company performs a sensitivity analysis.
    Holding all other assumptions constant, for each 50 basis
    point (i.e., one-half of one


percent) increase (decrease) in the discount rate, global
    pre-tax pension and OPEB plan cost would decrease (increase) by
    approximately $32 million.

Return on
    Plan Assets Assumption

In measuring net periodic cost for 2009, the company used a
    long-term expected rate of return of 8.5% for the pension plans
    covering U.S. and Puerto Rico employees. This assumption
    will also be used to measure net pension cost for 2010. This
    assumption is not applicable to the company’s OPEB plan
    because it is not funded.

The company establishes the long-term asset return assumption
    based on a review of historical compound average asset returns,
    both company-specific and relating to the broad market (based on
    the company’s asset allocation), as well as an analysis of
    current market and economic information and future expectations.
    The current asset return assumption is supported by historical
    market experience for both the company’s actual and
    targeted asset allocation. In calculating net pension cost, the
    expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of
    plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan
    assets in a systematic manner over five years. The difference
    between this expected return and the actual return on plan
    assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss
    and is subject to amortization in the future.

To understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return
    assumption on net cost, the company performs a sensitivity
    analysis. Holding all other assumptions constant, for each
    50 basis point increase (decrease) in the asset return
    assumption, global pre-tax pension plan cost would decrease
    (increase) by approximately $15 million.

Other
    Assumptions

The company used the Retirement Plan 2000 mortality table to
    calculate the pension and OPEB plan benefit obligations for its
    plans in the United States and Puerto Rico. For all other
    pension plans, the company utilized country and region-specific
    mortality tables to calculate the plans’ benefit
    obligations. The company periodically analyzes and updates its
    assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement,
    mortality and turnover, considering historical experience as
    well as anticipated future trends.

The assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and
    future healthcare costs are based on historical experience,
    market trends, and anticipated future company actions. Refer to
    Note 9 for information regarding the sensitivity of the
    OPEB plan obligation and the total of the service and interest
    cost components of OPEB plan cost to potential changes in future
    healthcare costs.

Legal
    Contingencies

The company is involved in product liability, patent,
    commercial, regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in
    the normal course of business. Refer to Note 11 for further
    information. The company records a liability when a loss is
    considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
    If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, and no
    amount within the range is a better estimate, the minimum amount
    in the range is accrued. If a loss is not probable or a probable
    loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability is recorded.
    The company has established reserves for certain of its legal
    matters. The company is not able to estimate the amount or range
    of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for which
    there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already
    reserved. The company also records any insurance recoveries that
    are probable of occurring. At December 31, 2009 total legal
    liabilities were $112 million and total insurance
    receivables were $96 million.

The company’s loss estimates are generally developed in
    consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of
    potential results. With respect to the recording of any
    insurance recoveries, after completing the assessment and
    accounting for the company’s legal contingencies, the
    company separately and independently analyzes its insurance
    coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable
    of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be
    collected. In performing the assessment, the company reviews
    available information, including historical company-specific and
    market collection experience for similar claims, current facts
    and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim,
    the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or
    companies, and other relevant information.


While the liability of the company in connection with the claims
    cannot be estimated with any certainty, and although the
    resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these
    matters could have a significant impact on the company’s
    results of operations and cash flows for that period, the
    outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position. While the company believes it has valid
    defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain,
    excessive verdicts do occur, and the company may in the future
    incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of
    claims.

Inventories

The company values its inventories at the lower of cost,
    determined using the

first-in,

first-out method, or market value. Market value for raw
    materials is based on replacement costs and market value for
    work in process and finished goods is based on net realizable
    value. The company reviews inventories on hand at least
    quarterly and records provisions for estimated excess,
    slow-moving and obsolete inventory, as well as inventory with a
    carrying value in excess of net realizable value. The regular
    and systematic inventory valuation reviews include a current
    assessment of future product demand, anticipated release of new
    products into the market (either by the company or its
    competitors), historical experience and product expiration.
    Uncertain timing of product approvals, variability in product
    launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product
    utilization all impact the estimates related to inventory
    valuation. Additional inventory provisions may be required if
    future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the
    company has estimated. The company is not able to estimate the
    probability of actual results differing from expected results,
    but believes its estimates are appropriate.

Deferred
    Tax Asset Valuation Allowances and Reserves for Uncertain Tax
    Positions

The company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more
    likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset
    will be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included
    in the company’s tax provision in the period of change. In
    determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, the
    company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history,
    expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods,
    and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood
    of realization of a deferred tax asset. The realizability
    assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to
    change in the future, particularly if earnings of a subsidiary
    are significantly higher or lower than expected, or if the
    company takes operational or tax planning actions that could
    impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary.

In the normal course of business, the company is audited by
    federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and is periodically
    challenged regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges
    relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation
    of income among various tax jurisdictions. The company believes
    the company’s tax positions comply with applicable tax law
    and the company intends to defend its positions. In evaluating
    the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the
    company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in
    accordance with GAAP, based on the technical support for the
    positions, the company’s past audit experience with similar
    situations, and potential interest and penalties related to the
    matters. The company’s effective tax rate in a given period
    could be impacted if, upon final resolution with taxing
    authorities, the company prevailed in positions for which
    reserves have been established, or was required to pay amounts
    in excess of established reserves.

Fair
    Value Measurements of Financial Assets and Liabilities

On January 1, 2008, the company adopted the new accounting
    standard for financial assets and financial liabilities
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated
    financial statements on a recurring basis and on January 1,
    2009, the company adopted the new accounting standard for
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
    value on a nonrecurring basis.

For assets that are measured using quoted prices in active
    markets, the fair value is the published market price per unit
    multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of
    transaction costs. The majority of the derivatives entered into
    by the company are valued using internal valuation techniques as
    no quoted market prices exist for such instruments. The
    principal techniques used to value these instruments are
    discounted cash flow and Black-Scholes models. The key inputs,
    which are observable, depend on the type of derivative, and


include contractual terms, counterparty credit risk, interest
    rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates and volatility. Refer
    to the Financial Instrument Market Risk section above for
    disclosures regarding sensitivity analyses performed by the
    company and Note 7 for further information regarding the
    company’s financial instruments.

In addition, the company’s pension plan assets and
    contingent payments associated with business combinations are
    valued at fair value on a recurring basis. The valuation of
    pension assets, which are recorded net of the plan’s
    liabilities, depends on the type of security the plan holds.
    Principally, the securities are valued using quoted prices in
    active markets or pricing matrices or models that incorporate
    observable market data inputs. Refer to the Pension and OPEB
    Plans section above and Note 9 for further information on
    the company’s pension plans. Contingent payments are valued
    using a discounted cash flow technique that reflects
    management’s expectations about probability of payment.
    Refer to Note 4 for further information on the
    company’s contingent payments relating to acquisitions.

Valuation
    of Intangible Assets, Including IPR&D

The company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair
    value. Valuations are generally completed for business
    acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis,
    incorporating the stage of completion. The most significant
    estimates and assumptions inherent in the discounted cash flow
    analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash
    flows, the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in
    the future cash flows, the assessment of the asset’s life
    cycle, and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset,
    including consideration of technical, legal, regulatory,
    economic and other factors. Each of these factors and
    assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible
    asset.

Acquired IPR&D is the value assigned to acquired technology
    or products under development which have not received regulatory
    approval and have no alternative future use.

Beginning in 2009, as discussed further above, the company
    adopted a new accounting standard for accounting for business
    combinations. Under the new accounting standard, acquired
    IPR&D included in a business combination is capitalized as
    an indefinite-lived intangible asset and is no longer expensed
    at the time of the acquisition. Development costs incurred after
    the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Upon receipt of
    regulatory approval of the related technology or product, the
    indefinite-lived intangible asset is then accounted for as a
    finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line
    basis over its estimated useful life. If the R&D project is
    abandoned, the indefinite-lived asset is charged to expense.

IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business
    combinations is expensed immediately. For such transactions,
    payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval
    are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of
    the related asset, and are classified as intangible assets.

Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with R&D
    projects, there is no assurance that actual results will not
    differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to
    prepare discounted cash flow analyses, nor that the R&D
    project will result in a successful commercial product.

Impairment
    of Assets

Goodwill is subject to impairment reviews annually, and whenever
    indicators of impairment exist. Intangible assets other than
    goodwill and other long-lived assets (such as fixed assets) are
    reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable. Refer to Note 1 for further
    information. The company’s impairment reviews are based on
    an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant
    judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense
    growth rates, changes in working capital use, foreign currency
    exchange rates, the selection of an appropriate discount rate,
    asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. The
    estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the
    company’s business plans and a market participant’s
    views of the company and similar companies. The use of
    alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease
    the estimated fair values of the assets, and potentially result
    in different impacts to the company’s results of
    operations. Actual results may differ from the company’s
    estimates.


Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

Stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date
    based on the fair value of the award, and the cost is recognized
    as expense ratably over the substantive vesting period.
    Determining the appropriate fair value model to use requires
    judgment. Determining the assumptions that enter into the model
    is highly subjective and also requires judgment. The
    company’s stock compensation costs principally relate to
    awards of stock options, and the significant assumptions include
    long-term projections regarding stock price volatility, employee
    exercise, post-vesting termination, and pre-vesting forfeiture
    behaviors, interest rates and dividend yields.

The company uses the Black-Scholes model for estimating the fair
    value of stock options. The company’s expected volatility
    assumption is based on an equal weighting of the historical
    volatility of Baxter’s stock and the implied volatility
    from traded options on Baxter’s stock. The expected life
    assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise
    patterns and employee post-vesting termination behavior. The
    risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the option is
    based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
    time of grant. The dividend yield reflects historical experience
    as well as future expectations over the expected life of the
    option. The forfeiture rate used to calculate compensation
    expense is primarily based on historical pre-vesting employee
    forfeiture patterns. In finalizing its assumptions, the company
    also reviews comparable companies’ assumptions, as
    available in published surveys and in publicly available
    financial filings.

The pre-vesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to
    the actual forfeiture rate. Therefore, changes in the
    forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of
    expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period. Estimated
    forfeitures are reassessed each period based on historical
    experience and current projections for the future.

The use of different assumptions would result in different
    amounts of stock compensation expense. The fair value of an
    option is particularly impacted by the expected volatility and
    expected life assumptions. To understand the impact of changes
    in these assumptions on the fair value of an option, the company
    performs sensitivity analyses. Holding all other variables
    constant, if the expected volatility assumption used in valuing
    the stock options granted in 2009 was increased by
    100 basis points (i.e., one percent), the fair value of a
    stock option relating to one share of common stock would
    increase by approximately 3%, from $11.68 to $12.07. Holding all
    other variables constant (including the expected volatility
    assumption), if the expected life assumption used in valuing the
    stock options granted in 2009 was increased by one year, the
    fair value of a stock option relating to one share of common
    stock would increase by approximately 8%, from $11.68 to $12.61.

The company began granting performance share units (PSUs) in
    2007. PSUs are earned by comparing the company’s growth in
    shareholder value relative to a performance peer group over a
    three-year period. Based on the company’s relative
    performance, the recipient of a PSU may earn a total award
    ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. The fair value of
    a PSU is estimated by the company at the grant date using a
    Monte Carlo model. A Monte Carlo model uses stock price
    volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of
    satisfying the market conditions and the resulting fair value of
    the award. The three primary inputs for the Monte Carlo model
    are the risk-free rate, volatility of returns and correlation of
    returns. The determination of the risk-free rate is similar to
    that described above relating to the valuation of stock options.
    The expected volatility and correlation assumptions are based on
    historical information.

The company is not able to estimate the probability of actual
    results differing from expected results, but believes the
    company’s assumptions are appropriate, based upon the
    requirements of accounting standards for stock compensation and
    the company’s historical and expected future experience.

Hedging
    Activities

As further discussed in Note 7 and in the Financial
    Instrument Market Risk section above, the company uses
    derivative instruments to hedge certain risks. As Baxter
    operates on a global basis, there is a risk to earnings
    associated with foreign exchange relating to the company’s
    recognized assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions
    denominated in foreign currencies. Compliance with accounting
    standards for derivatives and hedging activities and the
    company’s hedging policies require the company to make
    judgments regarding the


probability of anticipated hedged transactions. In making these
    estimates and assessments of probability, the company analyzes
    historical trends and expected future cash flows and plans. The
    estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the
    company’s business plans. If the company were to make
    different assessments of probability or make the assessments
    during a different fiscal period, the company’s results of
    operations for a given period would be different.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Transfers
    of Financial Assets

In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard relating
    to the accounting for transfers of financial assets. The new
    standard eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose
    entity and clarifies existing GAAP as it relates to determining
    whether a transferor has surrendered control over transferred
    financial assets. The standard limits the circumstances in which
    a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be
    derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire
    original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated
    with the transferor in the financial statements presented

and/or

when
    the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred
    financial asset. The standard also requires enhanced disclosures
    about transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s
    continuing involvement with transferred financial assets. It is
    effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
    fiscal years, beginning after November 15, 2009, with early
    adoption prohibited. The new standard will be applied
    prospectively, except for the disclosure requirements, which
    will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The
    new standard, which is effective for the company as of
    January 1, 2010, is not expected to have a material impact
    on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

Variable
    Interest Entities

In June 2009, the FASB issued a new standard that changes the
    consolidation model for variable interest entities (VIEs). The
    new standard requires an enterprise to qualitatively assess the
    determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the
    enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of
    the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s
    economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or
    the right to receive benefits from the entity that could
    potentially be significant to the VIE. The standard requires
    ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary
    beneficiary of a VIE. The standard expands the disclosure
    requirements for enterprises with a variable interest in a VIE.
    It is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
    those fiscal years, beginning after November 15, 2009, with
    early adoption prohibited. The new standard, which is effective
    for the company as of January 1, 2010, is not expected to
    have material impact on the company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

CERTAIN
    REGULATORY MATTERS

In July 2005, the company stopped shipment of COLLEAGUE infusion
    pumps in the United States. Following a number of Class I
    recalls (recalls at the highest priority level for the FDA)
    relating to the performance of the pumps, as well as the seizure
    litigation described in Note 11, the company entered into a
    Consent Decree in June 2006. Additional Class I recalls
    related to remediation and repair and maintenance activities
    were addressed by the company in 2007 and 2009. The Consent
    Decree provides for reviews of the company’s facilities,
    processes and controls by the company’s outside expert,
    followed by the FDA. In December 2007, following the outside
    expert’s review, the FDA conducted inspections and remains
    in a dialogue with the company. As discussed in Note 11,
    the company received a subpoena from the Office of the United
    States Attorney of the Northern District of Illinois relating to
    the COLLEAGUE infusion pump in September 2009. As discussed in
    Note 5, the company has recorded a number of charges in
    connection with its COLLEAGUE infusion pumps. It is possible
    that substantial additional charges, including significant asset
    impairments, related to COLLEAGUE may be required in future
    periods, based on new information, changes in estimates, and
    modifications to the current remediation plan.

In the first quarter of 2008, the company identified an
    increasing level of allergic-type and hypotensive adverse
    reactions occurring in patients using its heparin sodium
    injection products in the United States. The company initiated a
    field corrective action with respect to the products; however,
    due to users’ needs for the


products, the company and the FDA concluded that public health
    considerations warranted permitting selected dosages of the
    products to remain in distribution for use where medically
    necessary until alternate sources became available in the
    quarter, at which time the company’s products were removed
    from distribution.

In January 2010, the company received a Warning Letter from the
    FDA regarding observations made by the agency following
    inspections of the company’s manufacturing facility in
    Lessines, Belgium. The Warning Letter identifies a number of
    issues associated with certain fill and finish processes and
    controls relating to GAMMAGARD LIQUID therapy. The company is
    working with the FDA to address these issues.

While the company continues to work to resolve the issues
    described above, there can be no assurance that additional costs
    or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that
    additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will
    not occur, that the company will not face civil claims for
    damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional
    charges or significant asset impairments may not be required,
    that sales of any other product may not be adversely affected,
    or that additional legislation or regulation will not be
    introduced that may adversely affect the company’s
    operations. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in
    the company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for additional discussion of regulatory matters.

    development, manufacturing or sale or result in seizures,
    injunctions, monetary sanctions or criminal or civil
    liabilities, including any sanctions available under the Consent
    Decree entered into with the FDA concerning the COLLEAGUE and
    SYNDEO infusion pumps;

•

foreign currency fluctuations, particularly due to reduced
    benefits from the company’s natural hedges and limitations
    on the ability to cost-effectively hedge resulting from
    financial market and currency volatility;

•

fluctuations in supply and demand for plasma protein products;

•

reimbursement or rebate policies of government agencies and
    private payers;

production yields, regulatory clearances and customers’
    final purchase commitments with respect to the company’s
    pandemic vaccine;


•

product development risks, including satisfactory clinical
    performance, the ability to manufacture at appropriate scale,
    and the general unpredictability associated with the product
    development cycle;

•

the ability to enforce the company’s patent rights or
    patents of third parties preventing or restricting the
    company’s manufacture, sale or use of affected products or
    technology;

•

the impact of geographic and product mix on the company’s
    sales;

•

the impact of competitive products and pricing, including
    generic competition, drug reimportation and disruptive

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of
    Operations

Baxter International Inc. (Baxter or the company) develops,
    manufactures and markets products that save and sustain the
    lives of people with hemophilia, immune disorders, infectious
    diseases, kidney disease, trauma, and other chronic and acute
    medical conditions. As a global, diversified healthcare company,
    Baxter applies a unique combination of expertise in medical
    devices, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to create products
    that advance patient care worldwide. The company operates in
    three segments, which are described in Note 12.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the
    company to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
    amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates.

Basis of
    Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Baxter and its majority-owned subsidiaries, any minority-owned
    subsidiaries that Baxter controls, and variable interest
    entities (VIEs) in which Baxter is the primary beneficiary,
    after elimination of intercompany transactions.

Revenue
    Recognition

The company recognizes revenues from product sales and services
    when earned. Specifically, revenue is recognized when persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred (or
    services have been rendered), the price is fixed or
    determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For
    product sales, revenue is not recognized until title and risk of
    loss have transferred to the customer. The shipping terms for
    the majority of the company’s revenue arrangements are FOB
    destination. The recognition of revenue is delayed if there are
    significant post-delivery obligations, such as training,
    installation or other services. Provisions for discounts,
    rebates to customers, chargebacks to wholesalers and returns are
    provided for at the time the related sales are recorded, and are
    reflected as a reduction of net sales.

The company sometimes enters into arrangements in which it
    commits to delivering multiple products or services to its
    customers. In these cases, total arrangement consideration is
    allocated to the deliverables based on their relative selling
    prices. Then the allocated consideration is recognized as
    revenue in accordance with the principles described above.
    Selling prices are determined by applying a selling price
    hierarchy. Selling prices are determined using vendor specific
    objective evidence (VSOE), if it exists. Otherwise, selling
    prices are determined using third party evidence (TPE). If
    neither VSOE nor TPE is available, the company uses its best
    estimate of selling prices.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

In the normal course of business, the company provides credit to
    its customers, performs credit evaluations of these customers
    and maintains reserves for potential credit losses. In
    determining the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts,
    the company considers, among other items, historical credit
    losses, the past due status of receivables, payment histories
    and other customer-specific information. Receivables are written
    off when the company determines they are uncollectible. Credit
    losses, when realized, have been within the range of the
    company’s allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance
    for doubtful accounts was $118 million at December 31,
    2009 and $103 million at December 31, 2008.

Product
    Warranties

The company provides for the estimated costs relating to product
    warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The
    cost is determined based on actual company experience for the
    same or similar products, as well as other relevant information.
    Product warranty liabilities are adjusted based on changes in
    estimates.


Cash and
    Equivalents

Cash and equivalents include cash, certificates of deposit and
    money market funds with an original maturity of three months or
    less.

    value. The inventory amounts above are stated net of reserves
    for excess and obsolete inventory, which totaled
    $273 million at December 31, 2009 and
    $247 million at December 31, 2008.

Depreciation and amortization expense is calculated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    related assets, which range from 20 to 50 years for
    buildings and improvements and from three to 15 years for
    machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized
    over the life of the related facility lease (including any
    renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is
    shorter. Baxter capitalizes in machinery and equipment certain
    computer software and software development costs incurred in
    connection with developing or obtaining software for internal
    use. Capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line
    basis over the estimated useful lives of the software.
    Straight-line and accelerated methods of depreciation are used
    for income tax purposes. Depreciation and amortization expense
    was $557 million in 2009, $553 million in 2008 and
    $501 million in 2007. Repairs and maintenance expense was
    $251 million in 2009, $242 million in 2008 and
    $227 million in 2007.

Acquisitions

Results of operations of acquired companies are included in the
    company’s results of operations as of the respective
    acquisition dates. The purchase price of each acquisition is
    allocated to the net assets acquired based on estimates of their
    fair values at the date of the acquisition. Contingent
    consideration is recognized at the estimated fair value on the
    acquisition date. Any purchase price in excess of these net
    assets is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of purchase price
    in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final
    determination of fair values.

Research
    and Development

Research and development (R&D) costs are expensed as
    incurred. Acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D) is the value
    assigned to acquired technology or products under development
    which have not received regulatory


approval and have no alternative future use. Valuations are
    generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted
    cash flow analysis, incorporating the stage of completion. The
    most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a
    discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of
    projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to measure
    the risks inherent in the future cash flows, the assessment of
    the asset’s life cycle, and the competitive and other
    trends impacting the asset, including consideration of
    technical, legal, regulatory, economic and other factors. Each
    of these factors can significantly affect the value of the
    IPR&D.

Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval
    are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of
    the related asset, and are classified as intangible assets.

Beginning in 2009, as discussed further below, the company
    adopted a new accounting standard for accounting for business
    combinations. Under the new accounting standard, acquired
    IPR&D included in a business combination is capitalized as
    an indefinite-lived intangible asset and is no longer expensed
    at the time of the acquisition. Development costs incurred after
    the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Upon receipt of
    regulatory approval of the related technology or product, the
    indefinite-lived intangible asset is then accounted for as a
    finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line
    basis over its estimated useful life. If the R&D project is
    abandoned, the indefinite-lived asset is charged to expense.

Impairment
    Reviews

Goodwill

Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an impairment
    review annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist. An
    impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting
    unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. The company
    measures goodwill for impairment based on its reportable
    segments, which are BioScience, Medication Delivery and Renal.
    An impairment charge would be recorded for the difference
    between the carrying value and the present value of estimated
    future cash flows discounted using a risk-free market rate
    adjusted for a market participant’s view of similar
    companies and perceived risks in the cash flows, which
    represents the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.

Other
    Long-Lived Assets

The company reviews the carrying amounts of long-lived assets
    other than goodwill for potential impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
    asset may not be recoverable. Examples of such a change in
    circumstances include a significant decrease in market price, a
    significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an
    asset is being used, or a significant adverse change in the
    legal or business climate. In evaluating recoverability, the
    company groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level such
    that the identifiable cash flows relating to the group are
    largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and
    liabilities. The company then compares the carrying amounts of
    the assets or asset groups with the related estimated
    undiscounted future cash flows. In the event impairment exists,
    an impairment charge would be recorded as the amount by which
    the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair
    value. Depending on the asset and the availability of
    information, fair value may be determined by reference to
    estimated selling values of assets in similar condition, or by
    using a discounted cash flow model. In addition, the remaining
    amortization period for the impaired asset would be reassessed
    and, if necessary, revised.

Earnings Per Share

The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share
    (EPS) is net income attributable to Baxter. The denominator for
    basic EPS is the weighted-average number of common shares
    outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of
    outstanding employee stock options, performance share units,
    restricted stock units and restricted stock is reflected in the
    denominator for diluted EPS using the treasury stock method.


The following is a reconciliation of basic shares to diluted
    shares.

years ended December 31 (in millions)




Basic shares




Effect of dilutive securities




Diluted shares




The computation of diluted EPS excluded employee stock options
    to purchase 16 million, 8 million and 11 million
    shares in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, because the assumed
    proceeds were greater than the average market price of the
    company’s common stock, resulting in an anti-dilutive
    effect on diluted EPS.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Shipping costs, which are costs incurred to physically move
    product from Baxter’s premises to the customer’s
    premises, are classified as marketing and administrative
    expenses. Handling costs, which are costs incurred to store,
    move and prepare products for shipment, are classified as cost
    of sales. Approximately $220 million in 2009,
    $237 million in 2008 and $231 million in 2007 of
    shipping costs were classified in marketing and administrative
    expenses.

Income
    Taxes

Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of
    temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting
    based on enacted tax laws and rates. The company maintains
    valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all
    or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized. With
    respect to uncertain tax positions, the company determines
    whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained
    upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.
    Any tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition
    threshold is measured and recognized in the consolidated
    financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that is
    greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement. The liability relating to uncertain tax positions is
    classified as current in the consolidated balance sheets to the
    extent the company anticipates making a payment within one year.
    Interest and penalties associated with income taxes are
    classified in the income tax expense line in the consolidated
    statements of income and were not material.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Currency translation adjustments (CTA) related to foreign
    operations are principally included in other comprehensive
    income (OCI). For foreign operations in highly inflationary
    economies, translation gains and losses are included in other
    expense, net, and were not material.

Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes all changes in shareholders’
    equity that do not arise from transactions with shareholders,
    and consists of net income, CTA, pension and other employee
    benefits, realized net losses on hedges of net investments in
    foreign operations, unrealized gains and losses on cash flow
    hedges and unrealized gains and losses on unrestricted

available-for-sale

marketable equity securities. The

net-of-tax

components of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), a
    component of shareholders’ equity, were as follows.

Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or
    liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and
    are classified as short-term or long-term based on the scheduled
    maturity of the instrument. Based upon the exposure being
    hedged, the company designates its hedging instruments as cash
    flow or fair value hedges.

For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective
    as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is
    accumulated in AOCI and then recognized in earnings consistent
    with the underlying hedged item. Option premiums or net premiums
    paid are initially recorded as assets and reclassified to OCI
    over the life of the option, and then recognized in earnings
    consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flow hedges are
    classified in other expense, net, cost of sales, and net
    interest expense, and primarily relate to a hedge of
    U.S. Dollar-denominated debt issued by a foreign
    subsidiary, forecasted intercompany sales denominated in foreign
    currencies and anticipated issuances of debt, respectively.

For each derivative instrument that is designated and effective
    as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is
    recognized immediately to earnings, and offsets the gain or loss
    on the underlying hedged item. Fair value hedges are classified
    in net interest expense, as they hedge the interest rate risk
    associated with certain of the company’s fixed-rate debt.

For each derivative or nonderivative instrument that is
    designated and effective as a hedge of a net investment in a
    foreign operation, the gain or loss is recorded in OCI, with any
    hedge ineffectiveness recorded immediately in net interest
    expense. As with CTA, upon sale or liquidation of an investment
    in a foreign entity, the amount attributable to that entity and
    accumulated in AOCI would be removed from AOCI and reported as
    part of the gain or loss in the period during which the sale or
    liquidation of the investment occurs.

For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges,
    the change in fair value, which substantially offsets the change
    in book value of the hedged items, is recorded directly to other
    expense, net.

If it is determined that a derivative or nonderivative hedging
    instrument is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company
    discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If the company
    removes the cash flow hedge designation because the hedged
    forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, any
    gains or losses are immediately reclassified from AOCI to
    earnings. Gains or losses relating to terminations of effective
    cash flow hedges in which the forecasted transactions are still
    probable of occurring are deferred and recognized consistent
    with the income or loss recognition of the underlying hedged
    items. If the company terminates a fair value hedge, an amount
    equal to the cumulative fair value adjustment to the hedged
    items at the date of termination is amortized to earnings over
    the remaining term of the hedged item.

Derivatives, including those that are not designated as a hedge,
    are principally classified in the operating section of the
    consolidated statements of cash flows, in the same category as
    the related consolidated balance sheet account. With respect to
    the company’s net investment hedges, cross-currency swap
    agreements that included a financing element at inception were
    classified in the financing section of the consolidated
    statements of cash flows when settled and cross-currency swap
    agreements that did not include a financing element at inception
    were classified in the operating section.

Refer to Note 7 for information regarding the
    company’s derivative and hedging activities.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior
    period consolidated financial statements and notes to the
    current period presentation, including reclassifications related
    to the company’s adoption of a new accounting standard
    related to noncontrolling interests.

Changes
    in Accounting Standards

Business
    Combinations

On January 1, 2009, the company adopted a new accounting
    standard which changes the accounting for business combinations
    in a number of significant respects. The key changes include the
    expansion of transactions that qualify as business combinations,
    the capitalization of IPR&D as an indefinite-lived asset,
    the


recognition of certain acquired contingent assets and
    liabilities at fair value, the expensing of acquisition costs,
    the expensing of costs associated with restructuring the
    acquired company, the recognition of contingent consideration at
    fair value on the acquisition date, the recognition of
    post-acquisition date changes in deferred tax asset valuation
    allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties as income tax
    expense or benefit, and the expansion of disclosure
    requirements. This standard was applicable for acquisitions made
    by the company on or after January 1, 2009, including the
    April 2009 consolidation of Sigma International General Medical
    Apparatus, LLC (SIGMA) and the August 2009 acquisition of
    certain assets of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (Edwards
    CRRT) related to the hemofiltration business, also known as
    Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT). Refer to
    Note 4 for further information regarding SIGMA and Edwards
    CRRT.

Noncontrolling
    Interests

On January 1, 2009, the company adopted a new accounting
    standard which changes the accounting and reporting of
    noncontrolling interests (historically referred to as minority
    interests). The standard requires that noncontrolling interests
    be presented in the consolidated balance sheets within equity,
    but separate from Baxter shareholders’ equity, and that the
    amount of consolidated net income attributable to Baxter and to
    the noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented
    in the consolidated statements of income. Any losses in excess
    of the noncontrolling interest’s equity interest continue
    to be allocated to the noncontrolling interest. Purchases or
    sales of equity interests that do not result in a change of
    control are accounted for as equity transactions. Upon a loss of
    control the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, is
    measured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in
    earnings. In partial acquisitions, when control is obtained,
    100% of the assets and liabilities, including goodwill, are
    recognized at fair value as if the entire target company had
    been acquired. The new standard was applied prospectively as of
    January 1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure
    requirements, which have been applied retrospectively for prior
    periods presented. Prior to the adoption of the new standard,
    the noncontrolling interests’ share of net income was
    included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of
    income and the noncontrolling interests’ equity was
    included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated
    balance sheets. The accounting related provisions of the new
    accounting standard did not have a material impact on the
    consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued two updates to the Accounting Standards Codification
    related to revenue recognition. The first update eliminates the
    requirement that all undelivered elements in an arrangement with
    multiple deliverables have objective and reliable evidence of
    fair value before revenue can be recognized for items that have
    been delivered. The update also no longer allows use of the
    residual method when allocating consideration to deliverables.
    Instead, arrangement consideration is to be allocated to
    deliverables using the relative selling price method, applying a
    selling price hierarchy. VSOE of selling price should be used if
    it exists. Otherwise, TPE of selling price should be used. If
    neither VSOE nor TPE is available, the company’s best
    estimate of selling price should be used. The second update
    eliminates tangible products from the scope of software revenue
    recognition guidance when the tangible products contain software
    components and non-software components that function together to
    deliver the tangible products’ essential functionality.
    Both updates require expanded qualitative and quantitative
    disclosures and are effective for fiscal years beginning on or
    after June 15, 2010, with prospective application for new
    or materially modified arrangements or retrospective application
    permitted. Early adoption is permitted. The same transition
    method and period of adoption must be used for both updates. The
    company adopted these updates in 2009, prospectively applying
    them to arrangements entered into or materially modified on or
    after January 1, 2009. The early adoption of these updates
    did not have a material impact on the company’s
    consolidated financial statements and did not result in a change
    in its previously reported quarterly consolidated financial
    statements.

Other

Refer to Note 6 for disclosures provided in connection with
    a new accounting and disclosure standard related to
    collaborative arrangements. Refer to Note 7 for disclosures
    provided in connection with a new disclosure standard related to
    derivative and hedging activities and the fair value of
    financial instruments. Refer to


Note 9 for disclosures provided in connection with a new
    disclosure standard related to defined benefit pension plan
    assets.

New
    Accounting Standards

Transfers
    of Financial Assets

In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard relating
    to the accounting for transfers of financial assets. The new
    standard eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose
    entity and clarifies existing GAAP as it relates to determining
    whether a transferor has surrendered control over transferred
    financial assets. The standard limits the circumstances in which
    a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be
    derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire
    original financial asset to an entity that is not consolidated
    with the transferor in the financial statements presented

and/or

when
    the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred
    financial asset. The standard also requires enhanced disclosures
    about transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s
    continuing involvement with transferred financial assets. It is
    effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
    fiscal years, beginning after November 15, 2009, with early
    adoption prohibited. The new standard will be applied
    prospectively, except for the disclosure requirements, which
    will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The
    new standard, which is effective for the company as of
    January 1, 2010, is not expected to have a material impact
    on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

Variable
    Interest Entities

In June 2009, the FASB issued a new standard that changes the
    consolidation model for VIEs. The new standard requires an
    enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the
    primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both the
    power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and
    has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive
    benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant
    to the VIE. The standard requires ongoing reassessments of
    whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The
    standard expands the disclosure requirements for enterprises
    with a variable interest in a VIE. It is effective for fiscal
    years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
    after November 15, 2009, with early adoption prohibited.
    The new standard, which is effective for the company as of
    January 1, 2010, is not expected to have material impact on
    the company’s consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3

SALE OF TRANSFUSION THERAPIES BUSINESS

On February 28, 2007, the company divested substantially
    all of the assets and liabilities of its Transfusion Therapies
    (TT) business to an affiliate of TPG Capital, L.P. (TPG) for
    $540 million. TPG acquired the net assets of the TT
    business, including its product portfolio of manual and
    automated blood-collection products and storage equipment, as
    well as five manufacturing facilities, and established the new
    company as Fenwal Inc. (Fenwal). Cash proceeds were
    $473 million, representing the $540 million net of
    certain items, principally international receivables that were
    retained by the company post-divestiture.

During 2007, the company recorded a net gain on the sale of the
    TT business of $58 million. Of the net cash proceeds,
    $52 million was allocated to transition agreements to
    provide post-divestiture manufacturing, distribution and support
    services to Fenwal because these agreements provide for
    below-market consideration for those services. In 2008, the
    company recorded an income adjustment to the gain of
    $16 million as a result of the finalization of the net
    assets transferred in the divestiture. In connection with the TT
    divestiture, the company recorded a $35 million charge in
    2007 principally associated with severance and other
    employee-related costs. Reserve utilization through
    December 31, 2009 was $25 million. The reserve is
    expected to be substantially utilized by the end of 2010.

TT business sales included in the BioScience segment totaled
    $79 million in 2007 through the February 28 sale date.
    Post-divestiture revenue associated with the transition
    agreements with Fenwal totaled $74 million,
    $174 million and $144 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Included in the post-divestiture revenue


were $3 million, $25 million and $23 million in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of deferred revenue related
    to the transition agreements, and as of December 31, 2009,
    substantially all of the deferred revenue has been recognized.

The gain on the sale of the TT business and the related charges
    and adjustments were recorded in other expense, net in the
    consolidated statements of income. These amounts along with the
    post-divestiture revenues were reported at the corporate
    headquarters level and were not allocated to a segment.

NOTE 4

ACQUISITIONS OF AND INVESTMENTS IN BUSINESSES AND
    TECHNOLOGIES

In 2009, 2008 and 2007, cash outflows related to the
    acquisitions of and investments in businesses and technologies
    totaled $156 million, $99 million and
    $112 million, respectively. The following are the more
    significant acquisitions and investments, including licensing
    agreements that require significant contingent milestone
    payments, entered into in 2009, 2008 and 2007.


SIGMA

In April 2009, the company entered into an exclusive three-year
    distribution agreement with SIGMA covering the United States and
    international markets. The agreement, which enables Baxter to
    immediately provide SIGMA’s SPECTRUM large volume infusion
    pumps to customers, as well as future products under
    development, complements Baxter’s infusion systems
    portfolio and next generation technologies. The arrangement also
    included a 40% equity stake in SIGMA, and an option to purchase
    the remaining equity of SIGMA, exercisable at any time over a
    three-year term. The arrangement included a $100 million
    up-front payment and additional payments of up to
    $130 million for the exercise of the purchase option as
    well as for SIGMA’s achievement of specified regulatory and
    commercial milestones.

Because Baxter’s option to purchase the remaining equity of
    SIGMA limits the ability of the existing equity holders to
    participate significantly in SIGMA’s profits and losses,
    and because the existing equity holders have the ability to make
    decisions about SIGMA’s activities that have a significant
    effect on SIGMA’s success, the company concluded that SIGMA
    is a VIE. Baxter is the primary beneficiary of the VIE due to
    its exposure to the majority of SIGMA’s expected losses or
    expected residual returns and the relationship between Baxter
    and SIGMA created by the exclusive distribution agreement, and
    the significance of that agreement. Accordingly, the company
    consolidated the financial statements of SIGMA beginning in
    April 2009 (the acquisition date), with the fair value of the
    equity owned by the existing SIGMA equity holders reported as
    noncontrolling interests. The creditors of SIGMA do not have
    recourse to the general credit of Baxter.

The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of
    fair value related to the arrangement at the acquisition date.

The amount allocated to IPR&D is being accounted for as an
    indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or
    discontinuation. The other intangible assets primarily relate to
    developed technology and are being


amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated average
    useful life of eight years. The fair value of the purchase
    option was estimated using the Black-Scholes model, and the fair
    value of the noncontrolling interests was estimated using a
    discounted cash flow model. The contingent payments of up to
    $70 million associated with SIGMA’s achievement of
    specified regulatory and commercial milestones were recorded at
    their estimated fair value of $62 million. As of
    December 31, 2009, the estimated fair value of the
    contingent payments was $59 million, with the change in the
    estimated fair value since inception principally due to
    Baxter’s payment of $5 million for the achievement of
    a commercial milestone in 2009. Other changes in the estimated
    fair value of the contingent payments are being recognized
    immediately in earnings. The results of operations and assets
    and liabilities of SIGMA are included in the Medication Delivery
    segment, and the goodwill is included in this reporting unit.
    The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma
    impact of the arrangement with SIGMA was not significant to the
    results of operations of the company.

Edwards
    CRRT

In August 2009, the company acquired Edwards CRRT. CRRT provides
    a method of continuous yet adjustable fluid removal that can
    gradually remove excess fluid and waste products that build up
    with the acute impairment of kidney function, and is usually
    administered in an intensive care setting in the hospital. The
    acquisition expands Baxter’s existing CRRT business into
    new markets. The purchase price of $56 million was
    primarily allocated to other intangible assets and goodwill. The
    identified intangible assets of $28 million consisted of
    customer relationships and developed technology and are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated average
    useful life of eight years. The goodwill of $28 million is
    deductible for tax purposes. Baxter will pay Edwards up to an
    additional $9 million in purchase price based on revenue
    objectives which are expected to be achieved over the next two
    years, and such contingent purchase price was recorded at its
    estimated fair value on the acquisition date. The results of
    operations and assets and liabilities of Edwards CRRT are
    included in the Renal segment, and the goodwill is included in
    this reporting unit. The pro forma impact of the Edwards CRRT
    acquisition was not significant to the results of operations of
    the company.

2008 and

In 2008 and 2007, the company recorded IPR&D charges of
    $19 million and $50 million, respectively, relating to
    up-front obligations for technology that had not received
    regulatory approval and had no alternative future use.

The IPR&D charge in 2008 principally related to an
    in-licensing agreement with Innocoll Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
    (Innocoll), a division of Innocoll, Inc., granting Baxter
    exclusive rights to market and distribute Innocoll’s
    gentamicin surgical implant in the United States.

The IPR&D charge in 2007 principally related to a
    collaboration for the development of a home hemodialysis (HD)
    machine, as further discussed below. The charge also included
    costs associated with an in-licensing agreement with Nycomed
    Pharma AS (Nycomed) that grants Baxter exclusive rights to
    market and distribute Nycomed’s TACHOSIL surgical patch in
    the United States; an amendment to the company’s exclusive
    R&D, license and manufacturing agreement with Nektar
    Therapeutics (Nektar), expanding its existing BioScience
    business relationship to include the use of Nektar’s
    proprietary PEGylation technology in the development of
    longer-acting forms of blood clotting proteins; and an
    in-licensing arrangement with Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.
    (Halozyme) to apply Halozyme’s ENHANZE technology to the
    development of a subcutaneous route of administration for
    Baxter’s liquid formulation of IGIV (immune globulin
    intravenous).

In connection with the arrangements with Innocoll, Nycomed,
    Nektar and Halozyme, the company may be required to make
    additional payments of up to $220 million based on the
    successful completion of specified development, regulatory and
    sales milestones, in addition to, in certain cases, royalty
    payments on future sales of the related products. See
    Note 6 for further information regarding the company’s
    contingent milestone payment arrangements.


HHD/DEKA

In August 2007, the company entered into a collaboration with
    HHD, LLC (HHD) and DEKA Products Limited Partnership and DEKA
    Research and Development Corp. (collectively, DEKA) for the
    development of a home HD machine.

In connection with this Renal segment collaboration, the company
    purchased an option for $25 million to acquire the assets
    of HHD, and is reimbursing HHD for R&D services performed
    by DEKA, as well as other of HHD’s costs associated with
    developing the home HD machine. Pursuant to the option agreement
    with HHD, as amended, the company can exercise the option at any
    time between the effective date of the agreement and the earlier
    of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the
    product for home use or June 30, 2011. The company may be
    required to pay $18 million in advance of the exercise of
    the option, as specified in the amended agreement. Upon exercise
    of the option, the company would pay an additional
    $16 million (or $34 million in total to exercise the
    option), as well as additional payments of up to approximately
    $5 million based on contractual relationships between HHD
    and third parties. Because the company is the primary
    beneficiary of the risks and rewards of HHD’s activities,
    the company is consolidating the financial results of HHD from
    the date of the option purchase.

HHD’s assets and technology had not yet received regulatory
    approval and no alternative future use had been identified. In
    conjunction with the execution of the option agreement with HHD
    and the related payment of $25 million, the company
    recognized a net IPR&D charge of $25 million in 2007.
    The project was principally valued through discounted cash flow
    analysis, utilizing the income approach.

NOTE 5

INFUSION PUMP, EXIT AND OTHER CHARGES

Baxter has made and continues to make significant investments in
    assets, including inventory and PP&E, which relate to
    potential new products or modifications to existing products.
    The company’s ability to realize value from these
    investments is contingent on, among other things, regulatory
    approval and market acceptance of these new products. The
    company may not be able to realize the expected returns from
    these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in
    the future.

Infusion
    Pump Charges

The company remains in active dialogue with the FDA regarding
    various matters with respect to the company’s COLLEAGUE
    infusion pumps, including the company’s remediation plan
    and reviews of the company’s facilities, processes and
    quality controls by the company’s outside expert pursuant
    to the requirements of the company’s Consent Decree. The
    outcome of these discussions with the FDA is uncertain and may
    impact the nature and timing of the company’s actions and
    decisions with respect to the COLLEAGUE pump. The company’s
    estimates of the costs related to these matters are based on the
    current remediation plan and information currently available. It
    is possible that substantial additional charges, including
    significant asset impairments, related to COLLEAGUE may be
    required in future periods, based on new information, changes in
    estimates, and modifications to the current remediation plan.

While the company continues to work to resolve the issues
    associated with COLLEAGUE infusion pumps, there can be no
    assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties
    will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with
    respect to the company will not occur, that the company will not
    face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that
    substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments
    may not be required, that sales of any other product may not be
    adversely affected, or that additional legislation or regulation
    will not be introduced that may adversely affect the
    company’s operations and consolidated financial statements.

COLLEAGUE
    and SYNDEO Infusion Pumps

The company recorded charges and other costs of
    $27 million, $125 million, $14 million,
    $94 million and $77 million in 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively, related to issues associated with its
    COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion pumps.


The company stopped shipment of COLLEAGUE infusion pumps in July
    2005 in the United States. Following a number of Class I
    recalls (recalls at the highest priority level for the FDA)
    relating to the performance of the pumps, as well as the seizure
    litigation described in Note 11, the company entered into a
    Consent Decree in June 2006. Additional Class I recalls
    related to remediation and repair and maintenance activities
    were addressed by the company in 2007 and 2009. The Consent
    Decree provides for reviews of the company’s facilities,
    processes and controls by the company’s outside expert,
    followed by the FDA. In December 2007, following the outside
    expert’s review, the FDA conducted its inspection and
    remains in a dialogue with the company with respect to
    observations from its inspection as well as the validation of
    modifications to the pump required to remediate certain of the
    pumps.

Included in the 2005 charge was $4 million relating to
    asset impairments and $73 million for cash costs,
    representing an estimate of the cash expenditures for the
    materials, labor and freight costs expected to be incurred to
    remediate the design issues. Included in the 2006 charge was
    $3 million relating to asset impairments and
    $73 million for cash costs, which related to additional
    customer accommodations and adjustments to the previously
    established reserves for remediation costs based on further
    definition of the potential remediation requirements and the
    company’s experience remediating pumps outside of the
    United States. Also, in 2006, the company recorded an additional
    $18 million of expense, of which $7 million related to
    asset impairments and $11 million related to additional
    warranty and other commitments made to customers. The
    $14 million of costs recorded in 2007 represented changes
    in estimates relating to the previously established reserves for
    cash costs based on the company’s experience executing the
    remediation plan.

As a result of delays in the remediation plan, principally due
    to additional software modifications, validation, evaluation and
    testing required to remediate the pumps, and other changes in
    the estimated costs to execute the remediation plan, the company
    recorded a charge associated with the COLLEAGUE infusion pump of
    $53 million in the first quarter of 2008. This charge
    consisted of $39 million for cash costs and
    $14 million principally relating to asset impairments. The
    reserve for cash costs principally related to customer
    accommodations, including extended warranties, and other costs
    associated with these delays.

In the third quarter of 2008, as a result of the company’s
    decision to upgrade the global pump base to a standard software
    platform and other changes in the estimated costs to execute the
    remediation plan, the company recorded a charge of
    $72 million. This charge consisted of $46 million for
    cash costs and $26 million principally relating to asset
    impairments and inventory used in the remediation plan. The
    reserve for cash costs primarily consisted of costs associated
    with the deployment of the new software and additional repair
    and warranty costs.

In 2009, the company recorded a charge of $27 million
    related to planned retirement costs associated with SYNDEO and
    additional costs related to the COLLEAGUE infusion pump. This
    charge consisted of $14 million for cash costs and
    $13 million related to asset impairments. The reserve for
    cash costs primarily related to customer accommodations and
    additional warranty costs.

The charges were recorded in cost of sales in the company’s
    consolidated statements of income, and were included in the
    Medication Delivery segment’s pre-tax income.


The following summarizes cash activity in the company’s
    COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion pump reserves through
    December 31, 2009.

Exit and
    Other Charges

2009 Cost
    Optimization Charge

In 2009, the company recorded a charge of $79 million
    related to costs associated with optimizing its overall cost
    structure on a global basis. The charge included severance costs
    and asset impairments associated with the discontinuation of
    certain insignificant products and projects, the termination of
    which will not have a material impact on the company’s
    future results of operations.

Included in the charge was $69 million of cash costs,
    principally pertaining to severance and other employee-related
    costs associated with the elimination of less than 2% of the
    company’s workforce. Also included in the charge were asset
    impairments of $10 million, relating to inventory and fixed
    assets associated with discontinued products and projects.

Of the total charge, $30 million was recorded in cost of
    sales and $49 million was recorded in marketing and
    administrative expenses. The charge was recorded at the
    corporate level and was not allocated to a segment. Reserve
    utilization through December 31, 2009 was $5 million.
    The reserve is expected to be substantially utilized by the end
    of 2010.

SOLOMIX
    Drug Delivery System

During 2009, the company recorded a $54 million charge
    associated with the discontinuation of the company’s
    SOLOMIX drug delivery system in development based on technical
    issues which negatively impacted the expected profitability of
    the product. Substantially all of the charge related to asset
    impairments, principally to write off equipment intended to be
    used to manufacture the SOLOMIX drug delivery system. The charge
    was recorded in other expense, net in the company’s
    consolidated statement of income, and was included in the
    Medication Delivery segment’s pre-tax income.

CLEARSHOT
    Pre-Filled Syringes

During 2008, the company recorded a $31 million charge
    related to the company’s decision to discontinue its
    CLEARSHOT pre-filled syringe program based on management’s
    assessment of the market demand and expected profitability for
    this product. Substantially all of the charge related to asset
    impairments, principally to write off equipment used to
    manufacture the CLEARSHOT syringes. The charge was recorded in
    other expense, net in the company’s consolidated statement
    of income, and was included in the Medication Delivery
    segment’s pre-tax income.


    Restructuring Charge

In 2007, the company recorded a restructuring charge of
    $70 million principally associated with the consolidation
    of certain commercial and manufacturing operations outside of
    the United States. Based on a review of current and future
    capacity needs, the company decided to integrate several
    facilities to reduce the company’s cost structure and
    optimize operations, principally in the Medication Delivery
    segment. Included in the charge was $17 million related to
    asset impairments, principally to write down PP&E based on
    market data for the assets. Also included in the charge was
    $53 million for cash costs, principally pertaining to
    severance and other employee-related costs associated with the
    elimination of approximately 1% of the company’s total
    workforce. Reserve utilization related to the 2007 program was
    $22 million, $14 million and $5 million in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. As of the end of 2009, the 2007
    restructuring reserve has been substantially utilized.

    Restructuring Charge

In 2004, the company recorded a restructuring charge of
    $543 million principally associated with the company’s
    decision to implement actions to reduce the company’s
    overall cost structure and to drive sustainable improvements in
    financial performance. Included in the 2004 charge was
    $196 million relating to asset impairments, almost all of
    which was to write down PP&E. Also included in the 2004
    charge was $347 million for cash costs, principally
    pertaining to severance and other employee-related costs.
    Reserve utilization related to the 2004 program was
    $5 million, $28 million and $22 million in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. As of the end of 2009, the 2004
    restructuring reserve has been substantially utilized.

Significant
    Debt Issuances

In February 2009, the company issued $350 million of senior
    unsecured notes, maturing in March 2014 and bearing a 4.0%
    coupon rate. In August 2009, the company issued
    $500 million of senior unsecured notes, maturing in August
    2019 and bearing a 4.5% coupon rate. In May 2008, the company
    issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes, maturing in
    June 2018 and bearing a 5.375% coupon rate. In December 2007,
    the company issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes,
    maturing in December 2037, and bearing a 6.25% coupon rate. The
    notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the company’s
    option, subject to a make-whole redemption premium. In addition,
    during 2008, the company issued commercial paper, of which
    $200 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2008,
    with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.55%. There was no
    commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2009.

The net proceeds of the debt issuances noted above were used for
    general corporate purposes, including the repayment of
    $200 million of outstanding commercial paper in 2009 and
    for the settlement of cross-currency swaps in 2008. See
    Note 7 for further information regarding the settlement of
    cross-currency swaps. The debt instruments include certain
    covenants, including restrictions relating to the company’s
    creation of secured debt.

Credit
    Facilities

The company had $2.8 billion of cash and equivalents at
    December 31, 2009. The company’s primary revolving
    credit facility has a maximum capacity of $1.5 billion and
    matures in December 2011. As of December 31, 2009, there
    were no outstanding borrowings under this facility. The company
    also maintains a Euro-denominated credit facility with a maximum
    capacity of approximately $435 million at December 31,
    2009, which matures in January 2013. As of December 31,
    2009, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility.
    As of December 31, 2008, there was $164 million
    outstanding under this facility, which was repaid in 2009. The
    company’s facilities enable the company to borrow funds on
    an unsecured basis at variable interest rates, and contain
    various covenants, including a maximum net-debt-to-capital
    ratio. At December 31, 2009, the company was in compliance
    with the financial covenants in these agreements. The
    non-performance of any financial institution supporting either
    of the credit facilities would reduce the maximum capacity of
    these facilities by each institution’s respective
    commitment.

The company also maintains other credit arrangements, which
    totaled $454 million at December 31, 2009 and
    $409 million at December 31, 2008. Borrowings
    outstanding under these facilities totaled $29 million at
    December 31, 2009 and $24 million at December 31,
    2008.

Leases

The company leases certain facilities and equipment under
    capital and operating leases expiring at various dates. The
    leases generally provide for the company to pay taxes,
    maintenance, insurance and certain other


operating costs of the leased property. Most of the operating
    leases contain renewal options. Operating lease rent expense was
    $172 million in 2009, $161 million in 2008 and
    $157 million in 2007.

Collaborative
    Arrangements

On January 1, 2009, the company adopted a new accounting
    standard related to collaborative arrangements, which was
    required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented
    for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective
    date. The adoption of this new standard did not result in a
    change to the company’s historical consolidated financial
    statements.

In the normal course of business, Baxter enters into
    collaborative arrangements with third parties. Certain of these
    collaborative arrangements include joint operating activities
    involving active participation by both partners, where both
    Baxter and the other entity are exposed to risks and rewards
    dependent on the commercial success of the activity. These
    collaborative arrangements exist in all three of the
    company’s segments, take a number of forms and structures,
    principally pertain to the joint development and
    commercialization of new products, and are designed to enhance
    and expedite long-term sales and profitability growth.

The collaborative arrangements can broadly be grouped into two
    categories: those relating to new product development, and those
    relating to existing commercial products.

New
    Product Development Arrangements

The company’s joint new product development and
    commercialization arrangements generally provide that Baxter
    license certain rights to manufacture, market or distribute a
    specified technology or product under development. Baxter’s
    consideration for the rights generally consists of some
    combination of up-front payments, ongoing R&D cost
    reimbursements, royalties, and contingent payments relating to
    the achievement of specified pre-clinical, clinical, regulatory
    approval or sales milestones. Joint steering committees often
    exist to manage the various stages and activities of the
    arrangement. Control over the R&D activities may be shared
    or may be performed by Baxter. Baxter generally controls the
    commercialization phase, sometimes purchasing raw materials from
    the collaboration partner.

During the development phase, Baxter’s R&D costs are
    expensed as incurred. These costs may include R&D cost
    reimbursements to the partner, as well as up-front and milestone
    payments to the partner prior to the date the product receives
    regulatory approval. Milestone payments made to the partner
    subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as other
    intangible assets and amortized to cost of sales over the
    estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalty payments are
    expensed as cost of sales when they become due and payable. Any
    purchases of raw materials from the partner during the
    development stage are expensed as R&D, while such purchases
    during the commercialization phase are capitalized as inventory
    and recognized as cost of sales when the related finished
    products are sold. Baxter generally records the amount invoiced
    to the third-party customer for the finished product as sales,
    as Baxter is the principal and primary obligor in the
    arrangement.

Payments to collaborative partners classified in cost of sales
    were not significant in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Payments to
    collaborative partners classified in R&D expense were 6%,
    7% and 8% of total R&D expense in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The payments principally related to the
    development of tissue repair products, longer-acting forms of
    blood clotting proteins to treat hemophilia and a home HD device.

Commercial
    Product Arrangements

The company’s commercial product collaborative arrangements
    generally provide for a sharing of manufacturing, marketing or
    distribution activities between Baxter and the partner, along
    with a sharing of the related profits. The nature and split of
    the shared activities varies, sometimes split by type of
    activity and sometimes split by geographic area.

The entity that invoices the third-party customer is generally
    the principal and primary obligor in the arrangement and
    therefore records the invoiced amount as a sale. Cost-sharing
    payments are generally recorded in cost of sales. Baxter’s
    payments to partners under these types of arrangements were less
    than 1% of total cost of sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007.


Other
    Commitments and Contingencies

Joint
    Development and Commercialization Arrangements

In addition to the new product development arrangements
    discussed above, the company has entered into certain other
    arrangements which include contingent milestone payments. At
    December 31, 2009, the company’s unfunded milestone
    payments associated with all of its arrangements totaled
    $812 million. This total excludes any contingent royalties.
    Based on the company’s projections, any contingent payments
    made in the future will be more than offset over time by the
    estimated net future cash flows relating to the rights acquired
    for those payments. The majority of the contingent payments
    relate to arrangements in the BioScience segment. Included in
    the total are contingent milestone payments of $220 million
    relating to arrangements entered into during 2008 and 2007 that
    are discussed in Note 4. Aside from the items discussed in
    Note 4, significant collaborations relate to the
    development of hard and soft tissue-repair products to position
    the company to enter the orthobiologic market, the development
    of longer-acting forms of blood clotting proteins to treat
    hemophilia A and other arrangements.

Indemnifications

During the normal course of business, Baxter makes indemnities,
    commitments and guarantees pursuant to which the company may be
    required to make payments related to specific transactions.
    Indemnifications include: (i) intellectual property
    indemnities to customers in connection with the use, sales or
    license of products and services; (ii) indemnities to
    customers in connection with losses incurred while performing
    services on their premises; (iii) indemnities to vendors
    and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence
    or willful misconduct; and (iv) indemnities involving the
    representations and warranties in certain contracts. In
    addition, under Baxter’s Amended and Restated Certificate
    of Incorporation, and consistent with Delaware General
    Corporation Law, the company has agreed to indemnify its
    directors and officers for certain losses and expenses upon the
    occurrence of certain prescribed events. The majority of these
    indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any
    limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that the
    company could be obligated to make. To help address some of
    these risks, the company maintains various insurance coverages.
    Based on historical experience and evaluation of the agreements,
    the company does not believe that any significant payments
    related to its indemnifications will result, and therefore the
    company has not recorded any associated liabilities.

Legal
    Contingencies

Refer to Note 11 for a discussion of the company’s
    legal contingencies.

NOTE 7

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED FAIR VALUE
    MEASUREMENTS

Receivable
    Securitizations

Where economical, the company has entered into agreements with
    various financial institutions in which the entire interest in
    and ownership of the receivable is sold, principally consisting
    of trade receivables originated in Japan. The company had also
    entered into agreements in which undivided interests in certain
    pools of receivables were sold, principally consisting of
    hardware lease receivables originated in the United States and
    trade receivables originated in Europe.

In November 2007, the company purchased the third party interest
    in the previously sold receivables under the company’s
    European securitization facility, resulting in a net cash
    outflow of $157 million, consisting of $225 million of
    receivables and $68 million of retained interests. The
    $157 million net cash outflow was classified as an
    investing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
    Subsequent cash collections from customers relating to these
    receivables are also classified in the investing section of the
    consolidated statements of cash flows, and totaled $14 million,
    $46 million and $161 million for the years ended 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The European facility matured in
    November 2007 and was not renewed.

The U.S. securitization facility matured in December 2007
    and was not renewed. The company continues to service the
    receivables in its Japanese securitization arrangements.
    Servicing assets or liabilities are not


recognized because the company receives adequate compensation to
    service the sold receivables. The Japanese securitization
    arrangement includes limited recourse provisions, which are not
    material.

The securitization arrangements resulted in net cash outflows of
    $7 million, $3 million and $240 million (of which
    $225 million was classified as an investing activity and
    $15 million as an operating activity in the consolidated
    statement of cash flows) in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A
    summary of the securitization activity is as follows.

Concentrations
    of Risk

The company invests excess cash in certificates of deposit or
    money market funds and diversifies the concentration of cash
    among different financial institutions. With respect to
    financial instruments, where appropriate, the company has
    diversified its selection of counterparties, and has arranged
    collateralization and

master-netting

agreements to minimize the risk of loss.

While the current economic downturn has not meaningfully
    impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables, the
    company continues to do business with certain foreign
    governments which have recently experienced credit rating
    downgrades and may become unable to pay for our products or
    services.

Foreign
    Currency and Interest Rate Risk Management

The company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
    risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely
    impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
    The company’s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks
    to an acceptable level based on the company’s judgment of
    the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs.

The company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with
    respect to recognized assets and liabilities, forecasted
    transactions and net assets denominated in the Euro, Japanese
    Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar,
    Brazilian Real and Colombian Peso. The company manages its
    foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows
    the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural
    offsets. In addition, the company uses derivative and
    nonderivative instruments to further reduce the net exposure to
    foreign exchange. Gains and losses on the hedging instruments
    offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce
    the earnings and equity volatility resulting from foreign
    exchange. Market volatility and currency fluctuations may reduce
    the benefits of the company’s natural hedges and limit the
    company’s ability to cost-effectively hedge these exposures.

The company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and
    cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in
    interest rates. The company’s policy is to manage interest
    costs using a mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt that the
    company believes is appropriate. To manage this mix in a
    cost-efficient manner, the company periodically enters into
    interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at
    specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating
    interest amounts calculated by reference to an

agreed-upon

notional amount.

The company does not hold any instruments for trading purposes
    and none of the company’s outstanding derivative
    instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features.


Cash Flow
    Hedges

The company may use options, including collars and purchased
    options, forwards and cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign
    exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions
    denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and
    liabilities. The company periodically uses forward-starting
    interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to
    earnings associated with movements in interest rates relating to
    anticipated issuances of debt. Certain other firm commitments
    and forecasted transactions are also periodically hedged. Cash
    flow hedges primarily relate to forecasted intercompany sales
    denominated in foreign currencies, a hedge of
    U.S. Dollar-denominated debt issued by a foreign subsidiary
    and anticipated issuances of debt.

The notional amounts of foreign exchange contracts,
    cross-currency swaps (used to hedge U.S. Dollar-denominated
    debt issued by a foreign subsidiary) and interest rate contracts
    were $1.2 billion, $500 million and $200 million,
    respectively, as of December 31, 2009.

The maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge
    contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at
    December 31, 2009 is 12 months.

Fair
    Value Hedges

The company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its
    fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. These instruments hedge
    the company’s earnings from changes in the fair value of
    debt due to fluctuations in the designated benchmark interest
    rate.

The total notional amount of interest rate contracts designated
    as fair value hedges was $1.6 billion as of
    December 31, 2009.

Dedesignations

In 2009, the company terminated $500 million of its
    interest rate contracts, resulting in a net gain of
    $10 million that was deferred in AOCI.

Undesignated
    Derivative Instruments

The company uses forward contracts to hedge earnings from the
    effects of foreign exchange relating to certain of the
    company’s intercompany and third-party receivables and
    payables denominated in a foreign currency. These derivative
    instruments are generally not formally designated as hedges and
    the terms of these instruments generally do not exceed one month.

The total notional amount of undesignated derivative instruments
    was $222 million as of December 31, 2009.

The net loss recognized in OCI for cash flow hedges resulted in
    a tax benefit of $1 million that is not reflected in the
    table above. For the company’s fair value hedges, equal and
    offsetting gains of $80 million were recognized in net
    interest expense in 2009 as adjustments to the underlying hedged
    item, fixed-rate debt. Ineffectiveness related to the
    company’s cash flow and fair value hedges for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 was not material.

Hedges of
    Net Investments in Foreign Operations

In 2008, the company terminated its remaining net investment
    hedge portfolio and no longer has any outstanding net investment
    hedges. The company historically hedged the net assets of
    certain of its foreign operations using a combination of foreign
    currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps. In 2004, the
    company reevaluated its net investment hedge strategy and
    elected to reduce the use of these instruments as a risk
    management tool. As part of the change in strategy, the company
    executed offsetting, or mirror, cross-currency swaps relating to
    over half of the existing portfolio that effectively fixed the
    net amount that the


company would ultimately pay to settle the cross-currency swap
    agreements subject to this strategy. The net after-tax losses
    related to net investment hedge instruments recorded in OCI were
    $33 million and $48 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

When the cross-currency swaps were settled, the cash flows were
    reported within the financing section of the consolidated
    statement of cash flows. When the mirror swaps were settled, the
    cash flows were reported in the operating section of the
    consolidated statement of cash flows. Of the $528 million
    of net settlement payments in 2008, $540 million of cash
    outflows were included in the financing section and
    $12 million of cash inflows were included in the operating
    section. Of the $334 million of settlement payments in
    2007, $303 million of cash outflows were included in the
    financing section and $31 million of cash outflows were
    included in the operating section.

Fair
    Value Measurements

On January 1, 2008, the company adopted a new accounting
    standard relating to assets and liabilities that are measured at
    fair value on a recurring basis. The standard clarifies the
    definition of fair value whenever another standard requires or
    permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value.
    Specifically, the standard clarifies that fair value should be
    based on the assumptions market participants would use when
    pricing the asset or liability, and establishes a fair value
    hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those
    assumptions. On January 1, 2009, the company completed the
    adoption of the accounting standard for fair value measurements
    as it related to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are
    measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

The fair value hierarchy under the accounting standard for fair
    value measurements consists of the following three levels:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets that
    the company has the ability to access for identical assets or
    liabilities;

•

Level 2 — Quoted prices for similar instruments
    in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
    instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based
    valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the
    market; and

•

Level 3 — Valuations using significant inputs
    that are unobservable in the market and include the use of
    judgment by the company’s management about the assumptions
    market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.


The following table summarizes the bases used to measure
    financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value
    on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets.

For assets that are measured using quoted prices in active
    markets, the fair value is the published market price per unit
    multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of
    transaction costs. The majority of the derivatives entered into
    by the company are valued using internal valuation techniques as
    no quoted market prices exist for such instruments. The
    principal techniques used to value these instruments are
    discounted cash flow and Black-Scholes models. The key inputs
    are considered observable and vary depending on the type of
    derivative, and include contractual terms, interest rate yield
    curves, foreign exchange rates and volatility. The contingent
    payments are valued using a discounted cash flow technique that
    reflects management’s expectations about probability of
    payment.

Refer to Note 4 for further information regarding changes
    in fair value of the contingent payments related to SIGMA. Refer
    to Note 9 for fair value disclosures related to the
    company’s pension plans.

As discussed further in Note 5, the company recorded asset
    impairment charges related to SYNDEO, SOLOMIX and its cost
    optimization efforts in 2009. As the assets had no alternative
    use and no salvage value, the fair value, measured using
    significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), was assessed to
    be zero.


Book
    Values and Fair Values of Financial Instruments

In addition to the financial instruments that the company is
    required to recognize at fair value on the consolidated balance
    sheets, the company has certain financial instruments that are
    recognized at historical cost or some basis other than fair
    value. For these financial instruments, the following table
    provides the value recognized on the consolidated balance sheets
    and the approximate fair value.

Long-term litigation liabilities





The estimated fair values of insurance receivables and long-term
    litigation liabilities were computed by discounting the expected
    cash flows based on currently available information, which in
    many cases does not include final orders or settlement
    agreements. The discount factors used in the calculations
    reflect the

non-performance

risk of the insurance providers and the company, respectively.
    The estimated fair values of current and long-term debt and
    lease obligations were computed by multiplying price by the
    notional amount of the respective debt instrument. Price is
    calculated using the stated terms of the respective debt
    instrument and yield curves commensurate with the company’s
    credit risk. In determining the fair value of cost method
    investments, the company takes into consideration recent
    transactions, as well as the financial information of the
    investee. The carrying values of the other financial instruments
    approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities
    of most of these assets and liabilities.

NOTE 8

COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The company’s stock-based compensation generally includes
    stock options, performance share units (PSUs), restricted stock
    units (RSUs) and purchases under employee stock purchase plans.
    Shares issued relating to the company’s stock-based plans
    are generally issued out of treasury stock. As of
    December 31, 2009, approximately 28 million authorized
    shares are available for future awards under the company’s
    stock-based compensation plans. The following is a summary of
    the company’s significant stock compensation plans.

Stock
    Compensation Expense

Stock compensation expense recognized in the consolidated
    statements of income was $140 million, $146 million
    and $136 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    related tax benefit recognized was $40 million,
    $46 million and $46 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Stock compensation expense is recorded at the corporate level
    and is not allocated to a segment. Approximately three-quarters
    of stock compensation expense is classified in marketing and
    administrative expenses, with the remainder classified in cost
    of sales and R&D expenses. Costs capitalized in the
    consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009 were not
    significant.

Stock compensation expense is based on awards expected to vest,
    and therefore has been reduced by estimated forfeitures.
    Forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant
    and revised in subsequent periods, if necessary, if actual
    forfeitures differ from those estimates.


Stock
    Options

Stock options are granted to employees and non-employee
    directors with exercise prices at least equal to 100% of the
    market value on the date of grant. Beginning in 2007, stock
    options granted generally vest in one-third increments over a
    three-year period. Options granted prior to 2007 generally
    cliff-vest 100% three years from the grant date. Stock options
    granted to non-employee directors generally cliff-vest 100% one
    year from the grant date. Stock options granted typically have a
    contractual term of 10 years. The grant-date fair value,
    adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense on
    a straight-line basis over the substantive vesting period.

The fair value of stock options is determined using the
    Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average assumptions used in
    estimating the fair value of stock options granted during each
    year, along with the weighted-average grant-date fair values,
    were as follows.

The company’s expected volatility assumption is based on an
    equal weighting of the historical volatility of Baxter’s
    stock and the implied volatility from traded options on
    Baxter’s stock. The expected life assumption is primarily
    based on the vesting terms of the stock option, historical
    employee exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination
    behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected life of
    the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
    effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield reflects
    historical experience as well as future expectations over the
    expected life of the option.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the

    closing stock price on the last trading day of the year. The
    total intrinsic value of options exercised was
    $108 million, $328 million and $294 million in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, $78 million of unrecognized
    compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be
    recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of
    approximately 1.7 years.

PSUs

In 2007, the company restructured its annual equity awards stock
    compensation program for senior management to include PSUs with
    market-based conditions rather than RSUs. This change reflects
    the company’s view that as senior management has more
    responsibility for the company’s performance, the payout


of a portion of their equity awards should be completely
    “at-risk”. The company also changed the overall mix of
    stock compensation, from a weighting of 70% stock options and
    30% RSUs, to 50% stock options and 50% PSUs. The mix of stock
    options was adjusted downward in order to reflect the market
    shift away from stock options in favor of alternative
    performance-based awards. Certain members of senior management
    received a one-time transitional award of RSUs in 2007 as part
    of their annual equity awards.

The payout resulting from the vesting of the PSUs is based on
    Baxter’s growth in shareholder value versus the growth in
    shareholder value of the healthcare companies in Baxter’s
    peer group during the three-year performance period commencing
    with the year in which the PSUs are granted. Depending on
    Baxter’s growth in shareholder value relative to the peer
    group, a holder of PSUs is entitled to receive a number of
    shares of common stock equal to a percentage, ranging from 0% to
    200%, of the PSUs granted. The grant-date fair value, adjusted
    for estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense on a
    straight-line basis over the substantive vesting period.

The fair value of PSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo model.
    A Monte Carlo model uses stock price volatility and other
    variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the market
    conditions and the resulting fair value of the award. The
    assumptions used in estimating the fair value of PSUs granted
    during each year, along with the fair values, were as follows.

RSUs

The company periodically grants RSUs to employees and

    RSUs principally vest in one-third increments over a three-year
    period. However, awards for non-employee directors vest one year
    from the grant date. The grant-date fair value, adjusted for
    estimated forfeitures, is recognized as expense on a
    straight-line basis over the substantive vesting period. Prior
    to 2007, the company granted restricted stock to non-employee
    directors, which also vested one year from the grant date.

The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of
    shares granted and the quoted price of the company’s common
    stock on the date of grant.

    RSUs in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $52.51, $62.55 and $52.41,
    respectively. The fair value of RSUs and restricted stock vested
    in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $19 million, $34 million
    and $26 million, respectively.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plans

Nearly all employees are eligible to participate in the
    company’s employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Effective
    January 1, 2008, the ESPPs were amended and restated as a
    result of the company’s periodic reassessment of the nature
    and level of employee benefits.

For subscriptions beginning on or after January 1, 2008,
    the employee purchase price is 85% of the closing market price
    on the purchase date. For subscriptions that began on or after
    April 1, 2005 through the end of 2007, the employee
    purchase price was 95% of the closing market price on the
    purchase date.

No compensation expense was recognized for subscriptions that
    began on or after April 1, 2005 through the end of 2007.
    The company is recognizing compensation expense relating to
    subscriptions beginning on or after January 1, 2008.

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the company issued approximately
    875,000, 727,000 and 193,000 shares, respectively, under
    employee stock purchase plans. The number of shares under
    subscription at December 31, 2009 totaled approximately
    1.4 million.

Realized
    Excess Income Tax Benefits and the Impact on the Statement of
    Cash Flows

Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock compensation
    are presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as an
    outflow within the operating section and an inflow within the
    financing section. Realized excess tax benefits from stock-based
    compensation were $96 million in 2009 and $112 million
    in 2008. No income tax benefits were realized from stock-based
    compensation during 2007. The company uses the alternative
    transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock-based
    compensation, and applies the tax law ordering approach.

Stock
    Repurchase Programs

As authorized by the board of directors, the company repurchases
    its stock from time to time depending on the company’s cash
    flows, net debt level and market conditions. The company
    purchased 23 million shares for $1.2 billion in 2009,
    32 million shares for $2.0 billion in 2008 and
    34 million shares for $1.9 billion in 2007. In March
    2008, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to
    $2.0 billion of the company’s common stock. There is
    no remaining availability under the March 2008 authorization as
    of December 31, 2009. In July 2009, the board of directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to an additional
    $2.0 billion of the company’s common stock. At
    December 31, 2009, $1.95 billion remained available
    under the July 2009 authorization.


Cash
    Dividends

Beginning in 2007, the company converted from an annual to a
    quarterly dividend and increased the dividend by 15% on an
    annualized basis, to $0.1675 per share per quarter. In November
    2007, the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of
    $0.2175 per share ($0.87 per share on an annualized basis),
    representing an increase of 30% over the previous quarterly
    rate. In November 2008, the board of directors declared a
    quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share ($1.04 per share on an
    annualized basis), representing an increase of 20% over the
    previous quarterly rate. In November 2009, the board of
    directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share
    ($1.16 per share on an annualized basis), which was paid on
    January 5, 2010 to shareholders of record as of
    December 10, 2009. This dividend represented an increase of
    12% over the previous quarterly rate of $0.26 per share.

NOTE 9

RETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFIT PROGRAMS

The company sponsors a number of qualified and nonqualified
    pension plans for eligible employees. The company also sponsors
    certain unfunded contributory healthcare and life insurance
    benefits for substantially all domestic retired employees.

As required by a new accounting standard, on December 31,
    2008, the company changed the measurement date for its defined
    benefit pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans
    from September 30 to December 31, the company’s fiscal
    year-end. The company elected to use the

15-month

remeasurement approach, whereby a net-of-tax decrease to
    retained earnings of $27 million was recognized on
    December 31, 2008 equal to three-fifteenths of the net cost
    determined for the period from September 30, 2007 to
    December 31, 2008. The adjustment resulted in a net-of-tax
    increase to AOCI of $12 million. The remaining
    twelve-fifteenths of the net cost was recognized as expense in
    2008 as part of the net periodic benefit cost.

Accumulated
    Benefit Obligation Information

The pension obligation information in the table above represents
    the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The PBO incorporates
    assumptions relating to future compensation levels. The
    accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the same as the PBO
    except that it includes no assumptions relating to future
    compensation levels. The ABO for all of the company’s
    pension plans was $3.6 billion and $3.0 billion at the
    2009 and 2008 measurement dates, respectively.

The information in the funded status table above represents the
    totals for all of the company’s pension plans. The
    following is information relating to the individual plans in the
    funded status table above that have an ABO in excess of plan
    assets.

    paid from the plans’ assets (for funded plans) or from the
    company’s assets (for unfunded plans). The total expected
    OPEB benefit payments for the next ten years are net of
    approximately $56 million of expected federal subsidies
    relating to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
    Modernization Act, including $3 million, $4 million,
    $5 million, $5 million and $5 million in each of
    the years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

Amounts
    Recognized in AOCI

The pension and OPEB plans’ gains or losses, prior service
    costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations not yet
    recognized in net periodic benefit cost are recognized on a
    net-of-tax basis in AOCI and will be amortized from AOCI to net
    periodic benefit cost in the future. The following is a summary
    of the pre-tax losses included in AOCI at December 31, 2009

The company establishes the expected return on plan assets
    assumption primarily based on a review of historical compound
    average asset returns, both company-specific and relating to the
    broad market (based on the company’s asset allocation), as
    well as an analysis of current market and economic information
    and future expectations. The company plans to continue to use an
    8.50% assumption for its U.S. and Puerto Rico plans for
    2010.

Pension
    Plan Assets

An investment committee of members of senior management is
    responsible for supervising, monitoring and evaluating the
    invested assets of the company’s funded pension plans. The
    investment committee, which meets at least quarterly, abides by
    documented policies and procedures relating to investment goals,
    targeted asset allocations, risk management practices, allowable
    and prohibited investment holdings, diversification, use of
    derivatives, the relationship between plan assets and benefit
    obligations, and other relevant factors and considerations.

The investment committee’s documented goals and guidelines
    include the following.

•

Ability to pay all benefits when due;

•

Targeted long-term performance expectations relative to
    applicable market indices, such as Standard &
    Poor’s, Russell, MSCI EAFE, and other indices;

•

Targeted asset allocation percentage ranges (summarized below),
    and periodic reviews of these allocations;

•

Diversification of assets among third-party investment managers,
    and by geography, industry, stage of business cycle and other
    measures;


•

Specified investment holding and transaction prohibitions (for
    example, private placements or other restricted securities,
    securities that are not traded in a sufficiently active market,
    short sales, certain derivatives, commodities and margin
    transactions);

•

Specified portfolio percentage limits on holdings in a single
    corporate or other entity (generally 5%, except for holdings in
    U.S. government or agency securities);

•

Specified average credit quality for the fixed-income securities
    portfolio (at least A- by Standard & Poor’s or A3
    by Moody’s);

•

Specified portfolio percentage limits on foreign holdings; and

•

Periodic monitoring of investment manager performance and
    adherence to the Investment Committee’s policies.

Plan assets are invested using a total return investment
    approach whereby a mix of equity securities, debt securities and
    other investments are used to preserve asset values, diversify
    risk and exceed the planned benchmark investment return.
    Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on
    consideration of plan liabilities, the plans’ funded status
    and other factors, such as the plans’ demographics and
    liability durations. Investment performance is reviewed by the
    investment committee on a quarterly basis and asset allocations
    are reviewed at least annually.

Plan assets are managed in a balanced portfolio comprised of two
    major components: equity securities and fixed income securities.
    The target allocations for plan assets are 60 percent in
    equity securities and 40 percent in fixed income securities
    and other holdings. The documented policy includes an allocation
    range based on each individual investment type within the major
    components that allows for a variance from the target
    allocations of approximately 10 percentage points. Equity
    securities primarily include large-cap and mid-cap securities in
    the United States, common/collective trust funds, mutual funds,
    and partnership investments. Fixed income securities and other
    holdings primarily include cash, money market funds with an
    original maturity of three months or less, U.S. and foreign
    government and governmental agency issues, corporate bonds,
    municipal securities, derivative contracts and asset-backed
    securities.

Expected
    Pension and OPEB Plan Funding

The company’s funding policy for its pension plans is to
    contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding
    requirements, plus any additional amounts that the company may
    determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the
    plans, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the
    company, and other factors. Volatility in the global financial
    markets could have an unfavorable impact on future funding
    requirements. The company has no obligation to fund its
    principal plans in the United States and Puerto Rico in 2010.
    The company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any
    discretionary contributions. The company expects to make cash
    contributions to its pension plans of at least $335 million
    in 2010, which includes a $300 million discretionary cash
    contribution made to its pension plan in the United States in
    January 2010. The company expects to have net cash outflows
    relating to its OPEB plan of approximately $25 million in
    2010.

The table below details the funded status percentage of the
    company’s pension plans as of December 31, 2009,
    including certain plans that are unfunded in accordance with the
    guidelines of the company’s funding policy


outlined above. The table excludes the $300 million
    discretionary cash contribution made to the pension plan in the
    United States in January 2010.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) was signed into law on

    minimum funding requirements in the future.

Amendments
    to Defined Benefit Pension Plans

In 2006, the company amended its U.S. qualified defined
    benefit pension plan and U.S. qualified defined
    contribution plan, and in 2007, amended its Puerto Rico defined
    benefit pension plan, such that employees hired on or after the
    amendment dates are not eligible to participate in the pension
    plans but receive a higher level of company contributions in the
    defined contribution plans.

U.S.
    Defined Contribution Plan

Most U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a
    qualified defined contribution plan. Company contributions were
    $40 million in 2009, $36 million in 2008 and
    $26 million in 2007.

At December 31, 2009, the company had U.S. operating
    loss carryforwards totaling $14 million and foreign tax
    credit carryforwards totaling $84 million. The operating
    loss carryforwards expire between 2020 and 2022. The foreign tax
    credits principally expire in 2018. At December 31, 2009,
    the company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards
    totaling $554 million. Of this amount, $35 million
    expires in 2010, $7 million expires in 2011,
    $7 million expires in 2012, $12 million expires in
    2013, $12 million expires in 2014, $5 million expires
    in 2015, $37 million expires after 2015 and
    $439 million has no expiration date. Realization of these
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards depends on
    generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. A
    valuation allowance of $144 million and $140 million
    was recorded at December 31, 2009 and December 31,
    2008, respectively, to reduce the deferred tax assets associated
    with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as well as
    amortizable assets in loss entities, because the company does
    not believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be
    fully realized prior to expiration.

The company will continue to evaluate the need for additional
    valuation allowances and, as circumstances change, the valuation
    allowance may change.

The company recorded a tax charge of $90 million to the CTA
    component of OCI during 2009 relating to 2009 earnings outside
    the United States that are not deemed indefinitely reinvested.
    The company will continue to evaluate whether to indefinitely
    reinvest earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions as it
    continues to analyze the company’s global financial
    structure. Currently, management intends to continue to reinvest
    past


earnings in several jurisdictions outside of the United States
    for the foreseeable future, and therefore has not recognized
    U.S. income tax expense on these earnings.
    U.S. federal and state income taxes, net of applicable
    credits, on these foreign unremitted earnings of
    $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2009, would be
    approximately $2.1 billion. As of December 31, 2008
    the foreign unremitted earnings and U.S. federal and state
    income tax amounts were $5.7 billion and $1.7 billion,
    respectively.

Effective
    Income Tax Rate

The effective income tax rate was 19% in 2009, 18% in 2008 and
    19% in 2007. As detailed in the income tax expense
    reconciliation table above, the company’s effective tax
    rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year
    due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives,
    state and local taxes, and foreign taxes that are different than
    the U.S. federal statutory rate. The effective tax rate for
    2009 was impacted by greater income in jurisdictions with higher
    tax rates, partially offset by $51 million of income tax
    benefit from planning that accessed foreign tax losses.

Unrecognized
    Tax Benefits

The company classifies interest and penalties associated with
    income taxes in the income tax expense line in the consolidated
    statements of income. Interest and penalties recorded during
    2009, 2008 and 2007 were not material. The liability recorded at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 related to interest and
    penalties was $41 million and $40 million,
    respectively.

The following is a reconciliation of the company’s
    unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007.

Of the gross unrecognized tax benefits, $396 million and
    $437 million were recognized as liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively.

None of the positions included in the liability for uncertain
    tax positions related to tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Also, the
    reduction of the unrecognized tax benefits in each year did not
    significantly affect the company’s effective tax rate.

Tax
    Incentives

The company has received tax incentives in Puerto Rico,
    Switzerland, and certain other taxing jurisdictions outside the
    United States. The financial impact of the reductions as
    compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate is indicated in
    the income tax expense reconciliation table above. The tax
    reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably
    impacted earnings per diluted share by $0.50 in 2009, $0.45 in
    2008 and $0.51 in 2007. The Puerto Rico grant provides that the
    company’s manufacturing operations will be partially exempt
    from local taxes until the year 2013. The Switzerland grant
    provides that the company’s manufacturing operations will
    be partially exempt from local taxes until the year 2014. Baxter
    received an extension of its Swiss grant whereby the
    company’s manufacturing operations will be partially exempt
    from local taxes starting in 2014 and continuing through 2017.
    The tax incentives in the other jurisdictions continue until at
    least 2011.


Examinations
    of Tax Returns

As of December 31, 2009, Baxter had ongoing audits in the
    United States, Canada, Germany and Italy as well as bilateral
    Advance Pricing Agreement proceedings that the company
    voluntarily initiated between the U.S. government and the
    government of Switzerland with respect to intellectual property,
    product, and service transfer pricing arrangements. Baxter
    expects to settle these proceedings within the next
    12 months. Baxter expects to reduce the amount of its
    liability for uncertain tax positions within the next
    12 months by $302 million due principally to the
    expiration of certain statutes of limitations related to tax
    benefits taken in respect of losses from restructuring certain
    international operations and the settlements of certain
    multi-jurisdictional transfer pricing issues. While the final
    outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain, the company
    believes it has made adequate tax provisions for all years
    subject to examination.

Baxter is involved in product liability, patent, commercial, and
    other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of the
    company’s business. The company records a liability when a
    loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably
    estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a
    range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the
    minimum amount in the range is accrued. If a loss is not
    probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no
    liability is recorded.

Baxter has established reserves for certain of the matters
    discussed below. The company is not able to estimate the amount
    or range of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for
    which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already
    reserved. While the liability of the company in connection with
    the claims cannot be estimated with any certainty and although
    the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these
    matters could have a significant impact on the company’s
    results of operations and cash flows for that period, the
    outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a
    material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated
    financial position. While the company believes that it has valid
    defenses in these matters, litigation is inherently uncertain,
    excessive verdicts do occur, and the company may in the future
    incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of
    claims.

In addition to the matters described below, the company remains
    subject to other potential administrative and legal actions.
    With respect to regulatory matters, these actions may lead to
    product recalls, injunctions to halt manufacture and
    distribution, and other restrictions on the company’s
    operations and monetary sanctions. With respect to intellectual
    property, the company may be exposed to significant litigation
    concerning the scope of the company’s and others’
    rights. Such litigation could result in a loss of patent
    protection or the ability to market products, which could lead
    to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect
    future results of operations.

Patent
    Litigation

Sevoflurane
    Litigation

Since 2000, Baxter’s generic sevoflurane has been the
    subject of several patent infringement actions initiated by
    Abbott Laboratories and Central Glass Company. The initial
    lawsuit in the United States was resolved in Baxter’s favor
    in 2007 by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s
    decision that the asserted patent was invalid. In 2009, a
    lawsuit filed in Japan was also resolved in Baxter’s favor
    by the appellate court’s determination that Baxter’s
    generic sevoflurane did not infringe the Japanese patent at
    issue.

Related actions remain pending in the U.S. and Colombia. A
    patent infringement action is pending in the U.S.D.C. for the
    Northern District of Illinois on a second patent owned by Abbott
    and Central Glass. In September 2009, the District Court granted
    summary judgment of non-infringement in favor of Baxter. Abbott
    has requested reconsideration of this ruling. In 2007, Abbott
    brought a patent infringement action against Baxter in the Cali
    Circuit Court of Colombia based on a Colombian counterpart
    patent, and obtained an injunction preliminarily prohibiting the
    approval of Baxter’s generic sevoflurane in Colombia during
    the pendency of the infringement suit. In May 2008, the Court
    issued a decision maintaining the injunction, but suspending it
    during an appeal of the Court’s decision, which appeal is
    pending.


Peritoneal
    Dialysis Litigation

In October 2006, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a direct
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Baxter, and DEKA Products Limited
    Partnership (DEKA) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against
    Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. and Fresenius USA, Inc.
    The complaint alleges that Fresenius’ sale of the Liberty
    Cycler peritoneal dialysis systems and related disposable items
    and equipment infringes nine U.S. patents, which are owned
    by Baxter or exclusively licensed in the peritoneal dialysis
    field to Baxter from DEKA. The case is pending in the U.S.D.C.
    for the Northern District of California with a trial anticipated
    in mid-2010.

Hemodialysis
    Litigation

Since April 2003, Baxter has been pursuing a patent infringement
    action against Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. for
    infringement of certain Baxter patents. The patents cover
    Fresenius’ 2008K hemodialysis instrument. In 2007, the
    court entered judgment in Baxter’s favor holding the
    patents valid and infringed, and a jury assessed damages at
    $14 million for past sales only. On April 4, 2008, the
    U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of California granted
    Baxter’s motion for permanent injunction, granted
    Baxter’s request for royalties on Fresenius’ sales of
    the 2008K hemodialysis machines during a nine-month transition
    period before the permanent injunction took effect, and granted
    a royalty on disposables. On September 10, 2009, the
    appellate court affirmed Fresenius’ liability for
    infringing valid claims of Baxter’s main patent,
    invalidated certain claims of other patents, and remanded the
    case to the district court to finalize the scope of the
    injunction and the amount of damages owed to Baxter. In November
    2009, the appellate court denied Fresenius’ petition for
    re-hearing of the appeal. In January 2010, Fresenius consented
    to reentry of the injunction and a hearing on the royalty rate
    is expected to be set for the second quarter of 2010.

Other

In October 2004, a purported class action was filed in the
    U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois against Baxter
    and its current Chief Executive Officer and then current Chief
    Financial Officer and their predecessors for alleged violations
    of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
    amended. Plaintiff alleges that these defendants, along with the
    Administrative and Investment Committees of the company’s
    401(k) plans, breached their fiduciary duties to the plan
    participants by offering Baxter common stock as an investment
    option in each of the plans during the period of January 2001 to
    October 2004. In March 2006, the trial court certified a class
    of plan participants who elected to acquire Baxter common stock
    through the plans between January 2001 and the present. In April
    2008, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit denied
    Baxter’s interlocutory appeal and upheld the trial
    court’s denial of Baxter’s motion to dismiss. On
    September 28, 2009, the trial court partially granted
    Baxter’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing
    claims related to the 2004 time-frame. Fact discovery has been
    completed in this matter and expert discovery is proceeding. A
    trial date is currently scheduled for April 2010.

On October 12, 2005 the United States filed a complaint in
    the U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois to effect the
    seizure of COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion pumps that were on hold
    in Northern Illinois. Customer-owned pumps were not affected. On
    June 29, 2006, Baxter Healthcare Corporation entered into a
    Consent Decree for Condemnation and Permanent Injunction with
    the United States to resolve this seizure litigation. Additional
    third-party claims may be filed in connection with the COLLEAGUE
    matter. In September 2009, the company received a subpoena from
    the Office of the United States Attorney of the Northern
    District of Illinois requesting production of documents relating
    to the COLLEAGUE infusion pump. The company is fully cooperating
    with the request.

The company is a defendant, along with others, in eleven
    lawsuits brought in various U.S. federal courts alleging
    that Baxter and certain of its competitors conspired to restrict
    output and artificially increase the price of plasma-derived
    therapies since 2004. The complaints attempt to state a claim
    for class action relief and in some cases demand treble damages.
    These cases have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings
    before the U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Illinois.

In connection with the recall of heparin products in the United
    States, approximately 650 lawsuits, some of which are purported
    class actions, have been filed alleging that plaintiffs suffered
    various reactions to a heparin contaminant, in some cases
    resulting in fatalities. In June 2008, a number of these federal
    cases were


consolidated in the U.S.D.C. for the Northern District of Ohio
    for pretrial case management under the Multi District Litigation
    rules. A trial date for the first of these cases is scheduled
    for early 2011. In September 2008, a number of state court cases
    were consolidated in Cook County, Illinois for pretrial case
    management, with a scheduled trial date for the first of these
    cases in January 2011. Discovery is ongoing with respect to
    these matters.

The company is a defendant, along with others, in less than a
    dozen lawsuits which allege that Baxter and other defendants
    manipulated product reimbursements by, among other things,
    reporting artificially inflated average wholesale prices for
    Medicare and Medicaid eligible drugs. The cases have been
    consolidated for pretrial purposes before the U.S.D.C. for the
    District of Massachusetts. In April 2008, the court
    preliminarily approved a class settlement resolving Medicare
    Part B claims and independent health plan claims against
    Baxter and others, which had previously been reserved for by the
    company. Final approval of this settlement is expected in the
    first quarter of 2010. Baxter has also resolved a number of
    other cases brought by state attorneys general and other
    plaintiffs. A small number of lawsuits against Baxter brought by
    relators, state attorneys general and New York entities remain
    which seek unspecified damages, injunctive relief, civil
    penalties, disgorgement, forfeiture and restitution. Various
    state and federal agencies are conducting civil investigations
    into the marketing and pricing practices of Baxter and others
    with respect to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. These
    investigations may result in additional cases being filed.

Baxter currently is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and
    subject to additional claims brought by individuals who have
    hemophilia and their families, all seeking damages for injuries
    allegedly caused by anti-hemophilic factor concentrates VIII or
    IX derived from human blood plasma (factor concentrates)
    processed by the company and other acquired entities from the
    late 1970s to the mid-1980s. The typical case or claim alleges
    that the individual was infected with the HIV or HCV virus by
    factor concentrates that contained one or both viruses. None of
    these cases involves factor concentrates currently processed by
    the company. Baxter and other defendants have announced a
    settlement offer with respect to these claims. The fully
    reserved settlement is contingent on receiving acceptance from a
    significant percentage of the claimants by early 2010.

NOTE 12

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Baxter operates in three segments, each of which is a strategic
    business that is managed separately because each business
    develops, manufactures and markets distinct products and
    services. The segments and a description of their products and
    services are as follows:

The

BioScience

business processes recombinant and
    plasma-based proteins to treat hemophilia and other bleeding
    disorders; plasma-based therapies to treat immune deficiencies,
    alpha

1-antitrypsin

deficiency, burns and shock, and other chronic and acute
    blood-related conditions; products for regenerative medicine,
    such as biosurgery products; and vaccines.

The

Medication Delivery

business manufactures intravenous
    (IV) solutions and administration sets, premixed drugs and
    drug-reconstitution systems, pre-filled vials and syringes for
    injectable drugs, IV nutrition products, infusion pumps, and
    inhalation anesthetics, as well as products and services related
    to pharmacy compounding, drug formulation and packaging
    technologies.

The

Renal

business provides products to treat end-stage
    renal disease, or irreversible kidney failure. The business
    manufactures solutions and other products for peritoneal
    dialysis, a home-based therapy, and also distributes products
    for hemodialysis, which is generally conducted in a hospital or
    clinic.

The company uses more than one measurement and multiple views of
    data to measure segment performance and to allocate resources to
    the segments. However, the dominant measurements are consistent
    with the company’s consolidated financial statements and,
    accordingly, are reported on the same basis in this report. The
    company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates
    resources to them primarily based on pre-tax income along with
    cash flows and overall economic returns. Intersegment sales are
    generally accounted for at amounts comparable to sales to
    unaffiliated customers, and are eliminated in consolidation.


The accounting policies of the segments are substantially the
    same as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies in Note 1.

Certain items are maintained at the corporate level (Corporate)
    and are not allocated to a segment. They primarily include most
    of the company’s debt and cash and equivalents and related
    net interest expense, certain foreign exchange fluctuations
    (principally relating to intercompany receivables, payables and
    loans denominated in a foreign currency) and the majority of the
    foreign currency hedging activities, corporate headquarters
    costs, stock compensation expense, certain non-strategic
    investments and related income and expense, certain employee
    benefit plan costs, certain nonrecurring gains and losses,
    certain IPR&D charges, certain other charges (such as cost
    optimization, restructuring and certain litigation-related
    charges), deferred income taxes, certain litigation liabilities
    and related insurance receivables, and the revenues and costs
    related to the manufacturing, distribution and other transition
    agreements with Fenwal. All of the company’s Other net
    sales in the table below relate to the agreements with Fenwal.
    With respect to depreciation and amortization and expenditures
    for long-lived assets, the difference between the segment totals
    and the consolidated totals principally relate to assets
    maintained at Corporate.

In 2009, the $79 million charge related to the
    company’s cost optimization efforts, as further discussed
    in Note 5, was not allocated to a segment. Significant
    charges not allocated to a segment in 2008 included IPR&D
    charges of $12 million related to the company’s
    in-licensing agreement with Innocoll, as further discussed in
    Note 4, and $7 million related to the acquisition of
    certain technology applicable to the BioScience business.
    Significant charges not allocated to a segment in 2007 included
    a charge of $56 million related to average wholesale
    pricing litigation, as further discussed in Note 11, a
    restructuring charge of $70 million, as further discussed
    in Note 5, and IPR&D charges totaling
    $61 million, including $50 million further discussed
    in Note 4.

Included in the Medication Delivery segment’s pre-tax
    income in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $27 million,
    $125 million and $14 million, respectively, of charges
    and costs relating to COLLEAGUE and SYNDEO infusion pumps, a
    charge of $54 million in 2009 associated with the
    discontinuation of the company’s SOLOMIX drug delivery
    system in development and an impairment charge of
    $31 million in 2008 associated with the discontinuation of
    the CLEARSHOT pre-filled syringe program, as further discussed
    in Note 5.

Baxter common stock is listed on the New York, Chicago and SIX
    Swiss stock exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange is the
    principal market on which the company’s common stock is
    traded. At January 31, 2010, there were 48,489 holders of
    record of the company’s common stock.


Management’s
    Responsibility for Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of the
    company’s consolidated financial statements and related
    information appearing in this report. Management believes that
    the consolidated financial statements fairly reflect the form
    and substance of transactions and that the financial statements
    reasonably present the company’s financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Management has also included in the company’s
    consolidated financial statements amounts that are based on
    estimates and judgments, which it believes are reasonable under
    the circumstances.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited the company’s consolidated
    financial statements in accordance with the standards
    established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and
    provides an opinion on whether the consolidated financial
    statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the
    company.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The
    company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed under the supervision of the principal
    executive and financial officers, and effected by the board of
    directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America.

Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management
    used the framework in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission.

Based on that assessment under the framework in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

, management concluded that the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2009. The effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Baxter
    International Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(1) present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of Baxter
    International Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
    2009 and December 31, 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO). The company’s management is
    responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements and on the company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We
    conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Baxter carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
    the participation of its Disclosure Committee and management,
    including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of Baxter’s disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2009.
    Baxter’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by Baxter in
    the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis
    and that such information is communicated to management,
    including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer
    and its board of directors, to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Based on that evaluation the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that the company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of December 31,
    2009.

Assessment
    of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

upon vesting of restricted stock units, and
    1,840,691 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in
    connection with performance share unit grants.

The material features of each equity compensation plan under
    which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was
    adopted without the approval of shareholders are described below.

    Global Stock Option Plan

The 2001 Global Stock Option Plan is a broad-based plan adopted
    by Baxter’s board of directors in February 2001 to enable
    Baxter to make a special one-time stock option grant to eligible
    non-officer employees worldwide. On February 28, 2001,
    Baxter granted a non-qualified option to purchase
    200 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $45.515
    per share (post 2001 stock split) to approximately 44,000
    eligible employees under the 2001 Global Stock Option Plan. The
    exercise price of these options equals the closing price for
    Baxter common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the grant
    date. The options became exercisable on February 28, 2004,
    which was the third anniversary of the grant date, and expire on
    February 25, 2011. If an option holder leaves Baxter after
    the vesting date, then the option will expire three months after
    the holder leaves the company.

February
    2000 Stock Option Grant

The Compensation Committee approved grants to Baxter employees
    of non-qualified stock options to purchase 5,625,114 shares
    of common stock in February 2000. As of December 31, 2009,
    331,402 shares of common stock are issuable under the
    February 2000 grant. The exercise price of these stock options
    is equal to the fair market value of Baxter common stock on the
    date of grant, which is the closing price of the common stock on
    the New York Stock Exchange on the grant date. The exercise
    price of the options may be paid in cash or in certain shares of
    Baxter common stock. All of the stock options granted under
    these programs have vested and will expire in February 2010. The
    terms and conditions of each of these grants provide that the
    provisions of the shareholder-approved 1998 Incentive
    Compensation Program govern these stock option grants (except
    for the limit on shares available under the 1998 Program).

    Ownership by Directors and Executive Officers” and
    “Security Ownership by Certain Beneficial Owners” in
