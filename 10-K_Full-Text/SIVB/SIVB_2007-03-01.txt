PART I.

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

SVB Financial Group is a diversified financial
services company, as well as a bank holding company and financial holding
company. The company was incorporated in the state of Delaware in March 1999.
Through our various subsidiaries and divisions, we offer a variety of banking
and financial products and services. For over 20 years, we have been dedicated
to helping entrepreneurs succeed, especially in the technology, life sciences,
private equity and premium wine industries. We provide our clients with a
diversity of products and services to support them throughout their life
cycles, regardless of their size or stage of maturity.

We offer commercial banking products and services
through our principal subsidiary, Silicon Valley Bank, (the “Bank”) which is a
California state-chartered bank founded in 1983 and a member of the Federal
Reserve System. Through its subsidiaries, the Bank also offers brokerage,
investment advisory and asset management services. We also offer non-banking
products and services, such as investment banking, funds management, private
equity investment and equity valuation services, through our other subsidiaries
and divisions.

Our corporate headquarters are located at 3003 Tasman
Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054 and our telephone number is 408.654.7400.
We operate through 27 offices in the United States and three internationally in
the United Kingdom, India and China.

When we refer to “SVB
Financial Group,” the “Company,” or “we,” or use similar words, we intend to
include SVB Financial Group and all of its subsidiaries collectively, including
the Bank. When we refer to “SVB Financial” or the “Parent” we are referring
only to the parent company, SVB Financial Group.

Business Overview

For reporting purposes,
SVB Financial Group has four operating segments in which we report our
financial information:  Commercial
Banking, SVB Capital, SVB Alliant, and Other Business Services. Financial
information and results of operation for our operating segments are set forth
in Note 23 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Part II
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in Item 7, Management’s
Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations—Operating Segment Results.

Commercial Banking

We provide commercial banking services through the
Bank and its subsidiaries. The Bank provides solutions to the financial needs
of commercial clients through lending, deposit account and cash management, and
global banking and trade products and services.

Through lending products and services, the Bank
extends loans and other credit facilities to commercial clients. These loans
are most often secured by clients’ assets. Lending products and services
include traditional term loans, equipment loans, revolving lines of credit,
accounts-receivable-based lines of credit, asset-based loans, real estate loans,
vineyard development loans, and financing of affordable housing projects. The
Bank obtains warrants to purchase equity positions in the stock of many of its
emerging growth clients in consideration for making loans or providing other
services.

The Bank’s deposit account and cash management
products and services provide commercial clients with short- and long-term cash
management solutions. Deposit account products and services include traditional
deposit and checking accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market
accounts. In connection with deposit accounts, the Bank also provides lockbox
and merchant services that facilitate


timely depositing of
checks and other payments to clients’ accounts. Cash management products and
services include wire transfer and Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) payment
services to enable clients to transfer funds quickly from their deposit
accounts. Additionally, the cash management services unit provides collection
services, disbursement services, electronic funds transfers, and online banking
through SVBeConnect.

The Bank’s global banking and trade products and
services facilitate clients’ global finance and business needs. These products
and services include foreign exchange services that allow commercial clients to
manage their foreign currency risks through the purchase and sale of currencies
on the global inter-bank market. To facilitate clients’ international trade,
the Bank offers a variety of loans and credit facilities guaranteed by the
Export-Import Bank of the United States. It also offers letters of credit,
including export, import, and standby letters of credit, to enable clients to
ship and receive goods globally.

The Bank offers a variety of investment services and
solutions to its clients that enable companies to better manage their assets.
The Bank’s Repurchase Agreement Program, which is targeted to those clients who
seek interest income with minimal tolerance for loss of principal, offers the
ability to enter into secure overnight investments that are fully
collateralized. Through a broker-dealer subsidiary, SVB Securities, the Bank
offers money market mutual funds and fixed-income securities. SVB Securities is
registered with the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and is a member of
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD”) and the
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”). Finally, through a
registered investment advisory subsidiary, SVB Asset Management, the Bank
offers investment advisory services, including outsourced treasury services,
with customized cash portfolio management and reporting.

Our commercial banking
activities and business units are collectively referred to as SVB Silicon
Valley Bank across all of the company’s marketing communication materials.

SVB Capital

SVB Capital is the private equity division of SVB
Financial Group. This division focuses on the needs of private equity clients
domestically and internationally. There are two principal lines of business
under this segment: banking of private equity firms and funds management.

SVB Capital’s Private Equity Group manages
relationships with private equity clients on behalf of the Company. This
segment includes income generated by the banking services and financial
solutions provided to private equity clients. These services and solutions
include traditional deposit and checking accounts, loans, letters of credit,
and cash management services.

Through managed and
sponsored funds, SVB Capital also makes investments in private equity funds and
companies in the niches we serve. SVB Capital currently and actively manages
five private equity funds that are consolidated into our financial statements. Three
of these are funds of funds that invest in other private equity funds: SVB
Strategic Investors Fund, LP; SVB Strategic Investors Fund II, LP; and SVB
Strategic Investors Fund III, LP. The other two are direct equity funds that
invest in privately held technology and life sciences companies:  Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP and SVB
Capital Partners II, LP. SVB Capital also includes investments in Gold Hill
Venture Lending 03, LP and its parallel funds (collectively known as Gold Hill
Venture Lending 03, LP), which provide secured debt, typically to
emerging-growth clients in their earliest stages; and the Partners for Growth
funds that primarily provide secured debt to higher-risk, middle-market clients
in their later stages.

SVB Alliant

SVB Alliant principally
provides merger and acquisition advisory services (“M&A”), private
placement advisory services and fairness opinions. SVB Alliant is a
broker-dealer registered with the SEC


and is a
member of the NASD. Additionally, this segment includes SVB Alliant Europe
Limited, a subsidiary based in London, England, which provides investment
advisory services to companies in Europe. SVB Alliant Europe Limited commenced
full operations on May 2, 2006, when it received its license from the
Financial Services Authority, an independent body that regulates the financial
services industry in the United Kingdom.

Other Business Services

The Other Business
Services segment is principally comprised of SVB Private Client Services, SVB
Global, SVB Analytics and other business service units that are not
part of the Commercial Banking, SVB Capital or SVB Alliant segments. These
business units do not meet the separate reporting thresholds as defined by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

(“SFAS No. 131”) and, as a result, have been aggregated as Other Business
Services for segment reporting purposes. The Other Business Services segment
also reflects those adjustments necessary to reconcile the results of operating
segments based on our internal profitability reporting process to the interim
unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

SVB Private Client
Services

SVB Private Client
Services is a Bank division that provides a wide range of credit services to
targeted high-net-worth individuals using both long-term secured and short-term
unsecured lines of credit. These products and services include home equity
lines of credit, secured lines of credit, restricted stock purchase loans,
airplane loans, and capital call lines of credit. We also help our private
clients meet their cash management needs by providing deposit account products
and services, including checking accounts, deposit accounts, money market
accounts, and certificates of deposit.

SVB Global

SVB Global includes our
foreign subsidiaries, which facilitate our clients’ global expansion into major
technology centers around the world. SVB Global provides a variety of services,
including consulting and business services, referrals, and knowledge sharing;
and identifies business opportunities for the Company. SVB Global serves the needs
of some of our non-U.S. clients with global banking products, including foreign
exchange and global finance and access to our international banking network for
in-country services abroad. SVB Global also supports our private equity and
commercial banking clients with business services through subsidiaries in
India, China and the United Kingdom.

SVB Analytics

During the second quarter
of 2006, we commenced operations of SVB Analytics. This subsidiary provides
equity valuation and equity management services to private companies. We offer
equity management services, including capitalization data management, through
eProsper, Inc., a company in which SVB Analytics holds a controlling
ownership stake.

Income Sources

Our income is principally generated from two sources:
interest rate differentials and fees for financial services.

We generate income from interest-rate differentials
from our banking products. The difference between the interest rates paid by us
on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the
interest rates received on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to
clients and securities


held in our investment
portfolio, account for the major portion of our earnings. That income, referred
to as net interest income, was $352.5 million in 2006, $299.3 million in 2005,
and $229.5 million in 2004.

Our deposits are largely obtained from commercial
clients within our technology, life sciences, private equity, and premium wine
industry sectors, and, to a lesser extent, from individuals served by our
Private Client Services group. We do not obtain deposits from conventional retail
sources and have no brokered deposits.

We also generate income
from fees from our financial services. We market our full range of financial
services to all of our commercial clients. In addition to commercial banking
and private client services, we offer fee-based services, including investment
banking, brokerage and investment advisory services. Our ability to integrate
and cross-sell our diverse financial services to our clients is a strength of
our business model. As part of negotiated credit facilities and certain other
services, we frequently obtain rights to acquire stock in the form of equity
warrants in certain client companies. Our noninterest income was $141.2 million
in 2006, $117.5 million in 2005 and $107.8 million in 2004.

Industry Niches

In each of the industry
niches we serve, we provide services to meet the needs of our clients
throughout their life cycles, from early stage through maturity.

Technology and Life
Sciences

We serve a variety of clients in the technology and
life sciences industries. A key component of our technology and life sciences
business strategy is to develop relationships with clients at an early stage
and offer them banking services that will continue to meet their needs as they
mature and expand. We define “emerging-growth” clients as companies in the
start-up or early stages of their life cycles. These companies tend to be
privately held and backed by venture capital; they generally have few
employees, are primarily engaged in research and development, have brought
relatively few products or services to market, and have little or no revenue.
By contrast, we define “mature” clients as companies that tend to be more
established; these companies may be publicly traded.

Our technology and
life sciences clients generally fall into the following industries:

•

Hardware: Semiconductors,
Communications, and Electronics

•

Software: Software and
Services

•

Biotechnology

•

Drug Discovery

•

Medical Devices

•

Specialty
Pharmaceuticals

Private Equity

Since our founding, we
have cultivated strong relationships with venture capital firms worldwide, many
of which are also clients. SVB Capital provides financial services to more than
500 venture capital firms in the United States, and to other private equity
firms, facilitating deal flow to and from these private equity firms and
participating in direct investments in their portfolio companies.


Premium Wine

Our Wine Division, which
is part of the Bank, has become one of the leading providers of financial
services to premium wine producers in the Western United States, with over 300
winery and vineyard clients. We focus on vineyards and wineries that produce
grapes and wines of the highest quality.

Competition

The banking and financial
services industry is highly competitive, and evolves as a result of changes in
regulation, technology, product delivery systems, and the general market and
economic climate. Our current competitors include other banks and specialty and
diversified financial services companies that offer lending, leasing, other
financial products, and advisory services to our target client base. The
principal competitive factors in our markets include product offerings,
service, and pricing. Given our established market position with the client
segments that we serve, and our ability to integrate and cross-sell our diverse
financial services to extend the length of our relationships with our clients,
we believe we compete favorably in all our markets in these areas.

Employees

As of December 31,
2006, we employed approximately 1,140 full-time equivalent employees.

Supervision and
Regulation

General

Our bank and bank holding
company operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state
regulatory agencies intended to promote a safe and sound banking system that
provides access to credit and protects the insurance fund and depositors. As a
bank holding company and financial holding company, SVB Financial is subject to
inspection, supervision, regulation, and examination by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”) under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956 (“BHC Act”). The Bank, as a California-chartered bank and a
member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to primary supervision and
examination by the Federal Reserve Board, as well as the California Department
of Financial Institutions (“DFI”). SVB Financial’s other nonbank subsidiaries
are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and other applicable
federal and state agencies, such as the SEC and the NASD. SVB Financial, the
Bank and their subsidiaries are required to file periodic reports with these
regulators and provide any additional information that they may require. The
following summary describes some of the more significant laws, regulations, and
policies that affect our operations; it is not intended to be a complete
listing of all laws that apply to us. Any change in the statutes, regulations,
or policies that apply to our operations may have a material effect on our
business.

Regulation of
Holding Company

The Federal Reserve Board requires SVB Financial to
maintain minimum capital ratios, as discussed below in Regulatory Capital.
Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is also required to
serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks
and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition,
it is the Federal Reserve Board’s policy that in serving as a source of
strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should stand ready to
use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary
banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the
financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional
resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company’s failure
to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary
banks or to observe established guidelines with respect to the payment of
dividends by bank holding companies will generally be considered by the Federal


Reserve Board to be an
unsafe and unsound banking practice, a violation of the Federal Reserve Board’s
regulations, or both.

Prior to becoming a financial holding company on November 14,
2000, SVB Financial was required under the BHC Act to seek the prior approval
of the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or
control of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting
securities, or substantially all of the assets, of any bank, bank holding
company, or non-bank company. In addition, prior to becoming a financial
holding company, SVB Financial was generally limited under the BHC Act to
engaging, directly or indirectly, only in the business of banking or managing
or controlling banks and other activities that were deemed by the Federal
Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident
thereto.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLB Act”) amended
the BHC Act to permit a qualifying bank holding company, called a financial
holding company, to engage in a broader range of activities than those
traditionally permissible for bank holding companies. A financial holding
company may affiliate with securities firms and conduct, or acquire companies
that conduct, activities that are “financial in nature,” including insurance,
securities underwriting and dealing and market-making, and merchant banking
activities, as well as additional activities that the Federal Reserve Board
determines (in the case of incidental activities, in conjunction with the U.S.
Treasury Department) are incidental or complementary to financial activities,
without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. As a financial holding
company, SVB Financial no longer requires the prior approval of the Federal
Reserve Board to conduct, or to acquire ownership or control of entities
engaged in, activities that are financial in nature or activities that are
determined to be incidental or complementary to financial activities, although
the requirement in the BHC Act for prior Federal Reserve Board approval for the
acquisition by a bank holding company of more than 5% of any class of the
voting shares of a bank or savings association (or the holding company of
either) is still applicable. Additionally, under the merchant banking authority
added by the GLB Act, SVB Financial may invest in companies that engage in
activities that are not otherwise permissible, subject to certain limitations,
including that SVB Financial makes the investment with the intention of
limiting the investment in duration and does not manage the company on a
day-to-day basis.

To qualify as a financial holding company, a bank
holding company’s subsidiary depository institutions must be well capitalized
(as discussed below in Regulatory Capital) and have at least “satisfactory”
composite, managerial and Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”)
examination ratings. A bank holding company that does not satisfy the criteria
for financial holding company status is limited to activities that were
permissible under the BHC Act prior to the enactment of the GLB Act. A
financial holding company that does not continue to meet all of the
requirements for financial holding company status will, depending upon which
requirements it fails to meet, lose the ability to undertake new activities or
acquisitions that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies and
may not continue such activities.

SVB Financial is also
treated as a bank holding company under the California Financial Code. As such,
SVB Financial and its subsidiaries are subject to periodic examination by, and
may be required to file reports with, the DFI.

Regulatory Capital

The minimum risk-based capital guidelines that have
been adopted by federal banking agencies for bank holding companies and banks
are expected to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk
associated with a banking organization’s operations for both transactions
reported on the balance sheet as assets and those recorded as off-balance sheet
items. These off-balance sheet items include transactions such as commitments,
letters of credit and recourse arrangements. Under these credit guidelines,
dollar amounts of assets and credit-equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet
items are adjusted


by one of several
conversion factors and risk adjustment percentages. The Federal Reserve Board
requires bank holding companies and state member banks to maintain a minimum
ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-adjusted assets of eight percent, 10
percent to be considered “well-capitalized”.

Tier 1 capital must comprise at least half of total
capital and may consist of items such as common stock, retained earnings,
non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, minority interests including trust
preferred securities and, for bank holding companies, a limited amount of
qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less most intangibles
including goodwill. Additionally, trust preferred securities are limited to 25
percent of qualifying core capital elements. Regulatory minimums of Tier 1
capital are four percent, six percent to be considered “well-capitalized”. Tier
2 and Tier 3 comprise the remaining components of capital and may consist of
other preferred stock, certain other instruments, subordinated debt subject to
maturity restrictions, and the loan loss allowance.

The Federal Reserve Board also requires SVB Financial
and the Bank to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to total
average assets, referred to as the Tier 1 leverage ratio, of three
percent, five percent to be considered “well-capitalized”. In addition to these
requirements, the Federal Reserve Board may set individual minimum capital
requirements for specific institutions at rates substantially above the minimum
guidelines and ratios. Under certain circumstances, SVB Financial must file
written notice with, and obtain approval from, the Federal Reserve Board prior
to purchasing or redeeming its equity securities.

Upon the issuance by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) in January 2003 of Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

(“FIN 46R”), and
SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

(“SFAS
No. 150”), in May 2003, the Federal Reserve Board announced in July 2003
that qualifying trust preferred securities will continue to be treated as Tier
1 capital until notice is given to the contrary.

SVB Financial is also subject to rules that
govern the regulatory capital treatment of equity investments in non-financial
companies made on or after March 13, 2000 and held under certain specified
legal authorities by a bank or bank holding company. Under the rules, these
equity investments will be subject to a separate capital charge that will
reduce a bank holding company’s Tier 1 capital and, correspondingly, will
remove these assets from being taken into consideration in establishing a bank
holding company’s required capital ratios discussed above.

The rules provide for the following incremental
Tier 1 capital charges: 8% of the adjusted carrying value of the portion
of such aggregate investments that are up to 15% of Tier 1 capital; 12% of
the adjusted carrying value of the portion of such aggregate investments that
are between 15% and 25% of Tier 1 capital; and 25% of the adjusted
carrying value of the portion of such aggregate investments that exceed 25% of
Tier 1 capital. The rules normally do not apply to equity warrants
acquired by a bank for making a loan or to equity securities that are acquired
in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted and that are held and divested
in accordance with applicable law. The Bank does not currently hold any such
equity investments.

The federal banking agencies have also adopted a joint
agency policy statement, which provides that the adequacy and effectiveness of
a bank’s interest rate risk management process and the level of its interest
rate exposures are critical factors in the evaluation of the bank’s capital
adequacy. A bank with material weaknesses in its interest rate risk management
process or high levels of interest rate exposure relative to its capital will
be directed by the federal banking agencies to take corrective actions.
Financial institutions that have substantial amounts of their assets
concentrated in high-risk loans or non-traditional banking activities and who
fail to adequately manage these risks may be required to set aside capital in
excess of the regulatory minimums.


The capital ratios of SVB
Financial and the Bank, respectively, exceeded the well-capitalized
requirements, as defined above, at December 31, 2006. See Item 8.
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 21.
Regulatory Matters for the capital ratios of SVB Financial and the Bank as of December 31,
2006.

Regulation of
Silicon Valley Bank

The Bank is a
California-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank
is subject to primary supervision, periodic examination and regulation by the
DFI and the Federal Reserve Board. If, as a result of an examination of the
Bank, the Federal Reserve Board should determine that the financial condition,
capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or
other aspects of the Bank’s operations are unsatisfactory, or that the Bank or
its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, various
remedies are available to the Federal Reserve Board. Such remedies include the
power to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative action to
correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an
administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in
capital, to restrict the growth of the Bank, to assess civil monetary
penalties, to remove officers and directors, and ultimately to terminate the
Bank’s deposit insurance, which for a California-chartered bank would result in
a revocation of the Bank’s charter. The DFI has many of the same remedial
powers. Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the State of
California and the United States affect the operations of the Bank. State and
federal statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the Bank’s
operations, including reserves against deposits, ownership of deposit accounts,
interest rates payable on deposits, loans, investments, mergers and
acquisitions, borrowings, dividends, locations of branch offices, and capital
requirements. Further, the Bank is required to maintain certain levels of
capital. (See Regulatory Capital above.) The GLB Act changed the powers of
national banks and their subsidiaries, and made similar changes in the powers
of state bank subsidiaries. The GLB Act permits a national bank to underwrite,
deal in, and purchase state and local revenue bonds. It also allows a
subsidiary of a national bank to engage in financial activities that the bank
can not, except for general insurance underwriting and real estate development
and investment. In order for a subsidiary to engage in new financial
activities, the national bank and its depository institution affiliates must be
well-capitalized; have at least “satisfactory” general, managerial, and CRA
examination ratings; and meet other qualification requirements relating to
total assets, subordinated debt, capital, risk management, and affiliate
transactions. Subsidiaries of state banks can exercise the same powers as
national bank subsidiaries if they satisfy the same qualifying rules that
apply to national banks. For state banks, such as the Bank, that are members of
the Federal Reserve System, prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board is
required before they can create a subsidiary to capitalize on the additional
financial activities empowered by the GLB Act.

Restrictions on
Dividends

The ability of SVB
Financial and the Bank to pay cash dividends is governed by various applicable
statutory and regulatory requirements. The Federal Reserve Board and the DFI
have the authority to prohibit the Bank from engaging in activities that, in
their opinion, constitute unsafe or unsound practices in conducting its
business. Depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors,
the regulators could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments
might, under some circumstances, be an unsafe or unsound practice. If the Bank
fails to comply with its minimum capital requirements, its regulators could
restrict its ability to pay dividends using prompt corrective action or other
enforcement powers.


Transactions with Affiliates

Transactions between the
Bank and its operating subsidiaries (including SVB Securities, Inc. and
SVB Asset Management) and the Bank’s affiliates (including, but not limited to,
SVB Financial Group; SVB Alliant; and SVB Alliant Europe Limited) are subject
to restrictions imposed by federal and state law. These restrictions prevent
SVB Financial and other affiliates from borrowing from, or entering into other
credit transactions with, the Bank or its operating subsidiaries unless the
loans or other credit transactions are secured by specified amounts of
collateral. All such loans and credit transactions and other “covered
transactions” by the Bank and its operating subsidiaries with any one affiliate
are limited, in the aggregate, to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus; and
all such loans and credit transactions and other “covered transactions” by the
Bank and its operating subsidiaries with all affiliates are limited, in the
aggregate, to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. For this purpose, a “covered
transaction” generally includes, among other things, a loan or extension of
credit to an affiliate; a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an
affiliate; a purchase of assets from an affiliate; the acceptance of a security
issued by an affiliate as collateral for an extension of credit to any
borrower; and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit on
behalf of an affiliate. A company that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of
the Bank would not be considered to be an “affiliate” of the Bank or its
operating subsidiaries unless it fell into one of certain categories, such as a
“financial subsidiary” authorized under the GLB Act. In addition, the Bank and
its operating subsidiaries generally may not purchase a low-quality asset from
an affiliate. Moreover, covered transactions and other specified transactions
by the Bank and its operating subsidiaries with an affiliate must be on terms
and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The
Bank and its operating subsidiaries generally may engage in transactions with
affiliates only on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards,
that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank or its
subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with
nonaffiliated companies.

Prompt Corrective Action and Other Enforcement
Mechanisms

Federal banking agencies
possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action against an
insured bank and its holding company. Federal laws require each federal banking
agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured
banks. Each federal banking agency has issued regulations defining five
categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on
the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized,
undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically
undercapitalized.

Based upon its capital
levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized,
or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital
category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and
opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an
unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. At each successive
lower-capital category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions,
including restrictions on the bank’s activities, operational practices or the
ability to pay dividends. However, the federal banking agencies may not treat
an institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratios
actually warrant such treatment.

In addition to measures
taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, bank holding companies and
insured banks may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal
regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for
violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the agency
or term of a written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include
the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank; the issuance of a
cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the termination of the
bank’s deposit insurance; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the
issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal
agreements; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers,
directors, and other institution-affiliated parties; and the enforcement of
such actions through injunctions or restraining orders


based
upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable
relief was not granted.

Safety and Soundness Guidelines

Banking regulatory agencies
have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential
safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines
establish operational and managerial standards generally relating to: (1) internal
controls, information systems, and internal audit systems; (2) loan
documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest-rate exposure; (5) asset
growth and asset quality; and (6) compensation, fees, and benefits. In
addition, the banking regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness
guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to
ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and
reserves.

Premiums for Deposit Insurance

The Bank’s deposit
accounts are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund (“BIF”), as administered by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), up to the maximum permitted by
law. The FDIC may assess premiums to maintain a sufficient fund balance. The
amount charged is based on the capital level of an institution and on a
supervisory assessment based upon the results of examination findings by the
institution’s primary federal regulator and other information deemed relevant
by the FDIC to the institution’s financial condition and the risk posed to the
BIF. As of December 31, 2006, the FDIC’s semi-annual assessment for the
insurance of BIF deposits ranged from zero (0) to twenty seven (27) cents per
$100 of insured deposits. The FDIC may increase or decrease the premium rate on
a semi-annual basis. As of December 31, 2006, the Bank’s assessment rate
was zero.

The Bank is also required
to pay an annual assessment of approximately six (6) cents per $100 of
insured deposits toward the retirement of U.S. government-issued financing
corporation bonds.

Privacy

SVB Financial and the Bank
are subject to various laws and regulations concerning the privacy of their
customer information. The GLB Act imposed customer privacy requirements on any
company engaged in financial activities, including protection of the security
and confidentiality of customers’ non-public, personal information and
disclosure of its privacy and information sharing policies. Additionally, the California Financial Information Privacy Act
(“SB1”), which became effective on July 1, 2004 and applies to financial
institutions doing business in the State of California, tightened existing
federal restrictions on the sharing of consumers’ non-public personal
information with affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties.

USA Patriot Act of 2001

As part of the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA Patriot Act”), Congress adopted the
International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001
(“IMLAFATA”). IMLAFATA amended the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and adopted certain
additional measures that established or increased already existing obligations
of financial institutions, including the Bank, to identify their customers,
monitor and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information
by federal banking regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and, at
the option of the Bank, share information with other financial institutions.
The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury has adopted several regulations to implement
these provisions. Pursuant to these
regulations, the Bank is required to implement appropriate policies and
procedures relating to anti-money laundering matters, including compliance with
applicable regulations, suspicious activities, currency transaction reporting
and customer due diligence. The Bank’s BSA compliance program is also subject
to federal regulatory review.


Regulation of Certain Subsidiaries

SVB Alliant, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of SVB Financial, and SVB Securities, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Bank, are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and
members of the NASD and as such are subject to regulation by the SEC and the
NASD. SVB Asset Management, a wholly-owned investment advisory subsidiary of
the Bank, is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
as amended, and is subject to its rules and regulations.

Our broker-dealer
subsidiaries are subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which is designed to
measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer. Under
this rule, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain the minimum
net capital deemed necessary to meet broker-dealers’ continuing commitments to
customers and others. Under certain circumstances, this rule could limit
the ability of SVB Financial to withdraw capital from SVB Alliant and of the
Bank to withdraw capital from SVB Securities.

ITEM
1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our business faces significant risks, including
credit, market/liquidity, operational, legal/regulatory and
strategic/reputation risks. The factors described below may not be the only
risks we face and are not intended to serve as a comprehensive listing or be
applicable only to the category of risk under which they are disclosed. The
risks described below are generally applicable to more than one of the
following categories of risks. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or
that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations.
If any of the events or circumstances described in the following factors
actually occurs, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations
could suffer.

Credit Risks

If
our clients fail to perform under their loans, our business, profitability and
financial condition could be adversely affected.

As a lender, one of the
largest risks we face is the possibility that a significant number of our
smaller client borrowers, or a smaller number of our larger client borrowers,
will fail to pay their loans when due. If borrower defaults cause large losses,
it could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and
financial condition. We have established an evaluation process designed to
determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. While this evaluation
process uses historical and other objective information, the classification of
loans and the establishment of loan losses are dependent to a great extent on
our experience and judgment. We cannot assure you that our allowance for loan
losses will be sufficient to absorb future loan losses or prevent a material
adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial condition.

Because
of the credit profile of our loan portfolio, our levels of nonperforming assets
and charge-offs can be volatile. We may need to make material provisions for
loan losses in any period, which could reduce net income or increase net losses
in that period.

Our loan portfolio has a
credit profile different from that of most other banking companies. Many of our
loans are made to companies in the early stages of development with negative
cash flows and no


established
record of profitable operations. In many cases, repayment of the loan is
dependent upon receipt of additional equity financing from venture capitalists
or others. Collateral for many of our loans often includes intellectual
property, which is difficult to value and may not be readily salable in the case
of default. Because of the intense competition and rapid technological change
that characterizes the companies in our technology and life sciences industry
sectors, a borrower’s financial position can deteriorate rapidly. Additionally,
we are increasing our lending to larger corporate technology clients, including
some companies with greater levels of debt relative to their equity, and have
increased the average size of our loans over time. These changes could affect
the risk of borrower default and increase the impact on us of any single
borrower default. For all of these reasons, our level of nonperforming loans,
loan charge-offs and additional allowance for loan losses can be volatile and
can vary materially from period to period. Increases in our level of
nonperforming loans may require us to increase our provision for loan losses in
any period, which could reduce our net income or cause net losses in that
period.

Market/Liquidity
Risks

Our
current level of interest rate spread may decline in the future. Any material
reduction in our interest spread could have a material impact on our business,
profitability and financial condition.

A major portion of our net
income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the
interest rates paid by us on amounts used to fund interest-earning assets and
the interest rates and fees we receive on those assets. We fund
interest-earning assets using non-interest bearing deposits, interest-bearing
deposits and other borrowings. Our interest-earning assets include loans
extended to our clients and securities held in our investment portfolio.

Interest rates are highly
sensitive to many factors beyond our control, such as inflation, recession,
global economic disruptions, unemployment and the fiscal and monetary policies
of the federal government and its agencies. In the aggregate, our deposits are
less sensitive to interest rate increases than our loans. As a result, recent increases
in market interest rates have caused our interest rate spread to increase. However,
if interest rates decline, it likely will cause our interest rate spread to
decline.

In addition to general
changes in the level of interest rates, increases in the interest rates we pay
on amounts used to fund interest-earning assets or decreases in the interest
rates we receive on our interest-earning assets could affect our interest rate
spread. For example, in 2006 we funded our loan growth primarily through
short-term borrowings. These funds carry meaningfully higher interest rate costs
than our current deposit base. If we significantly increase the amount of our
interest-earning assets that we fund through borrowings rather than deposits,
our interest rate spread will likely decline. Similarly, if we significantly
increase the amount of our interest-earning assets that we fund through
interest-bearing deposits, or increase the rates we pay on those deposits, our
interest rate spread likely would decline. Interest rates paid by us could be
affected by competitive, legislative or other developments. For example,
Congress has for many years debated repealing a law that prohibits banks from
paying interest rates on checking accounts. If this law were to be repealed, we
would be subject to competitive pressure to pay interest on our clients’
checking accounts, which would negatively affect our interest rate spread.

The interest rates we
receive on our interest-earning assets could be affected by a variety of
factors, including market interest rates as noted above, competition, a change
over time in the mix of loans comprising our loan portfolio and the mix of
loans and investment securities on our balance sheet. Additionally, a portion
of our loan fee income, a component of loan interest income, is predicated on
the receipt of warrant assets. If we fail to continue to receive warrant
assets, our future interest rate spread may decline.

Our
business is dependent upon access to funds on attractive terms. Consequently, a
reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business,
profitability and financial condition.

We derive our net interest
income through lending or investing capital on terms that provide returns in
excess of our costs for obtaining that capital. As a result, our credit ratings
are important to our


business.
A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and
competitive position, increase our borrowing costs or increase the interest
rates we pay on deposits. Further, our credit ratings and the terms upon which
we have access to capital may be influenced by circumstances beyond our
control, such as overall trends in the general market environment, perceptions
about our creditworthiness or market conditions in the industries in which we
focus.

Warrant,
private equity fund and direct equity investment portfolio gains or losses
depend upon the performance of the portfolio investments and the general
condition of the public equity markets, which are uncertain and may vary
materially by period.

We historically have
obtained rights to acquire stock, in the form of equity warrants, in certain
clients as part of negotiated credit facilities and for other services. We also
have made investments in private equity funds as well as direct equity
investments in companies. The timing and amount of income, if any, from the
disposition of client warrants, securities obtained through the exercise of
warrants, private equity funds and direct equity investments, as well as the
fair market value of these rights and investments, typically depend upon factors
beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying portfolio
companies, investor demand for initial public offerings (“IPOs”), fluctuations
in the market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies, levels
of merger and acquisition activity and legal and contractual restrictions on
our ability to sell securities and investments. In future periods, we may not
be able to continue to obtain equity warrants to the same extent we
historically have achieved, we may not realize gains from the exercise of
warrants, the gains realized upon the sale of the securities obtained through
the exercise of warrants and the gains realized upon the sale of our fund or
direct equity investments may be materially less than the current fair value of
such assets reflected in our financial statements, or the fair market value of
some or all of these assets could decline. Each of these developments could
have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. All
of these factors are difficult to predict. Due to the nature of investing and
holding warrants in private equity venture-backed technology and life science
companies, it is likely that investments within our portfolio will become
impaired. However, we are not in a position to know at the present time which
specific investments, if any, are likely to become impaired or the extent or
timing of individual impairments. Therefore, we cannot predict future
investment gains or losses with any degree of accuracy, and any gains or losses
are likely to vary materially from period to period.

Public equity
offerings and mergers and acquisitions involving our clients can cause loans to
be paid off early, which could adversely affect our business and profitability.

While an active market for
public equity offerings and mergers and acquisitions generally has positive
implications for our business, one negative consequence is that our clients may
pay off or reduce their loans with us if they complete a public equity
offering, are acquired by or merge with another entity or otherwise receive a
significant equity investment. Any significant reduction in our outstanding
loans could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.

Operational Risks

If we fail to
retain our key employees or recruit
new employees, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.

We rely on a substantial
number of employees who have technical expertise in their subject matter area
and a strong network of relationships with individuals and institutions in the
markets we serve. If we were to have less success in recruiting and retaining
these employees than our competitors, our growth and profitability could be
adversely affected. We believe that our employees frequently have opportunities
for alternative employment with other organizations, including competing
financial institutions and our clients.


Changes
to our employee compensation structure could adversely affect our results of
operations and cash flows, as well as our ability to attract

, recruit and retain certain key employees.

In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
Payment

(“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123
and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB No. 25”)
and requires us to record compensation expense for all employee share-based
payments. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. This
expense has had and likely will continue to have a material impact on our
results of operations going forward.

In May 2006, in an
effort to align our option grant rate to that of other financial institutions
similar to us, we committed to restrict the total number of shares of our
common stock issued under stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted
stock unit awards, stock bonus awards and any other equity awards granted
during a fiscal year as a percentage of the total number of shares outstanding
on a prospective basis. We may in the future consider taking other actions to
modify employee compensation structures, such as granting cash compensation or
other forms of equity compensation. Our decision to reduce the number of option
shares to be granted on a prospective basis, and any other future changes we
may adopt in our employee compensation structures, could adversely affect our
results of operations and cash flows, as well as our ability to attract,
recruit and retain certain key employees.

We
could be liable for breaches of security in our online banking services. Fear
of security breaches could limit the growth of our online services.

We offer various
internet-based services to our clients, including online banking services. The
secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is essential
to maintain our clients’ confidence in our online services. Advances in
computer capabilities, new discoveries or other developments could result in a
compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect client transaction
data. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to
prevent security breaches and periodically test our security, failure to
mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect our ability to offer and
grow our online services and could harm our business.

People generally are
concerned with security and privacy on the Internet and any publicized security
problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet as a means of conducting
commercial transactions. Our ability to provide financial services over the
Internet would be severely impeded if clients became unwilling to transmit
confidential information online. As a result, our operations and financial
condition could be adversely affected.

Business
interruptions due to natural disasters and other events beyond our control can
adversely affect our business.

Our operations can be
subject to natural disasters and other events beyond our control, such as
earthquakes, fires, public health issues, power failures, telecommunication
loss, terrorist attacks and acts of war. Our corporate headquarters and a
portion of our critical business offices are located in California near major
earthquake faults. Such events of disaster, whether natural or manmade, could
cause severe destruction or interruption to our operations. Financial
institutions, such as us, generally must resume operations promptly following
any interruption. If we were to suffer a disruption and were not able to resume
operations within a period consistent with industry standards, our business
could suffer serious harm. In addition, depending on the nature and duration of
the interruption, we might be vulnerable to fraud or other losses or to a loss
of client confidence. Our business continuity program, which we began
implementing during 2005, has not yet been completed. There is no assurance
that our business continuity program can adequately mitigate the risks of such
business interruptions.

We rely on other companies to provide key components
of our business infrastructure.

Third parties provide key
components of our business infrastructure, such as transaction processing,
Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in services provided by
these third parties, or any


failure
of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use, could
adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers
and otherwise to conduct our business. Technological or financial difficulties
of a third party service provider could adversely affect our business to the
extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of
services provided by that party.

We
face risks associated with the ability of our information technology systems
and our processes to support our operations and future growth effectively.

In order to serve our
target clients effectively, we have developed a comprehensive array of banking
and other products and services. In order to support these products and
services, we have developed and purchased information technology and other
systems and processes that are relatively more complex and costly than those
used by other financial institutions of our size. As our business continues to
grow, we will continue to invest in these systems and processes. These
investments may affect our future profitability. In addition, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to effectively and timely improve our systems
and processes to meet our business needs efficiently. A failure of our
information technology systems or processes to meet our current business needs,
or a failure to improve these systems and processes effectively and in a timely
manner to meet our future business needs, could adversely affect our
operations, financial condition, results of operations and future growth.

We
depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and
counterparties.

In deciding whether to
extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and
counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of
customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other
financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and
counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and,
with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For
example, in deciding whether to extend credit, we may assume that a customer’s
audited financial statements conform to GAAP and present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows of the customer. We also may rely on the audit report covering those
financial statements. Our financial condition and results of operations could
be negatively affected if we rely on financial statements or other information
that do not comply with GAAP or that are materially misleading.

Our
accounting policies and methods are key to how we report our financial
condition and results of operations. They may require management to make
estimates about matters that are uncertain.

Our accounting policies
and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition
and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting
and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with
GAAP and reflect management’s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report
our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the
accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of
which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in our
reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different
alternative.

Changes
in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.

From time to time, FASB
changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the
preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict
and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and
results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or
revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial
statements.


If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal
control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our
financial results. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose
confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the
trading price of our stock.

If we identify material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could be
required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could
lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial
reports. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations, including our stock price, and could potentially
subject us to litigation.

Legal/Regulatory Risks

We
are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities
and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our
business.

SVB Financial Group,
including the Bank, is extensively regulated under federal and state laws
governing financial institutions. These regulations are intended primarily for
the protection of depositors, other clients of financial institutions and the
deposit insurance fund. Federal and state laws and regulations govern, limit or
otherwise affect the activities in which we may engage and may affect our
ability to expand our business over time. In addition, a change in the
applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy could have a material
effect on our business, including limiting the types of financial services and
products we may offer or increasing the ability of nonbanks to offer competing
financial services and products. These laws and regulations also require
financial institutions, including SVB Financial and the Bank, to maintain
certain minimum levels of capital, which may affect our ability to use our
capital for other business purposes.

If we
were to violate federal or state laws or regulations governing financial
institutions, we could be subject to disciplinary action that could have a
material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

Federal and state banking
regulators possess broad powers to take supervisory or enforcement action with
respect to financial institutions. Other regulatory bodies, including the SEC,
the NASD and state securities regulators, regulate broker-dealers, including
our subsidiaries SVB Alliant and SVB Securities. Violations of the laws
governing financial institutions and broker-dealers could result in the
revocation of necessary licenses or authorizations, the imposition of censures,
civil money penalties or fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders, and
the suspension or expulsion from the securities business of a firm, its
officers or employees. Supervisory actions could result in higher capital
requirements, higher insurance premiums and limitations on the activities of
SVB Financial Group. These supervisory actions could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and reputation. In
addition, increased regulatory requirements, whether due to the adoption of new
laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations, or more
expansive or aggressive interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
profitability.

SVB
Financial relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue.

SVB Financial is a
separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives
substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These
dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on SVB Financial’s
common and preferred stock, should SVB Financial elect to pay dividends, and
interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and state laws and
regulations limit the amount of dividends that our bank and certain of our
nonbank subsidiaries may pay to SVB Financial. Also, SVB Financial’s right to
participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or
reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.


Strategic/Reputation Risks

Adverse
changes in domestic or global economic conditions, especially in the technology
sector, could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth and
profitability.

If conditions deteriorate
in the domestic or global economy, especially in the technology, life science,
private equity and premium wine industry niches, our business, growth and
profitability may be materially adversely affected. A global, U.S. or
significant regional economic slowdown could harm us by adversely affecting our
clients’ and prospective clients’ access to capital to fund their businesses,
their ability to sustain and grow their businesses, the level of funds they have
available to maintain deposits, their demand for loans, their ability to repay
loans and otherwise.

Decreases
in the amount of equity capital available to start-up and emerging-growth
companies could adversely affect our business, growth and profitability.

Historically, our strategy
has focused on providing banking products and services to emerging-growth
companies receiving financial support from sophisticated investors, including
venture capitalists, “angels,” and corporate investors. We derive a meaningful
share of our deposits from these emerging growth companies and provide them
with loans as well as other banking products and services. In some cases, our
lending credit decision is based on our analysis of the likelihood that our
venture capital or angel-backed client will receive a second or third round of
equity capital from investors. If the amount of capital available to such
companies decreases, it is likely that the number of new clients and investor
financial support to our existing borrowers could decrease, which could have an
adverse effect on our business, profitability and growth prospects.

Among the factors that
have affected and could in the future affect the amount of capital available to
startup and emerging-growth companies are the receptivity of the capital
markets IPOs or mergers and acquisitions of companies within our technology and
life science industry sectors, the availability and return on alternative
investments and general economic conditions in the technology and life science
industries. Reduced capital markets valuations could reduce the amount of
capital available to startup and emerging-growth companies, including companies
within our technology and life science industry sectors.

We
face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business, growth and
profitability.

Other banks and specialty
and diversified financial services companies, many of which are larger than we
are, offer lending, leasing, other financial products and advisory services to
our client base. In addition, we compete with hedge funds and private equity
funds, which currently have very significant amounts of capital available to
invest and lend. In some cases, our competitors focus their marketing on our
industry sectors and seek to increase their lending and other financial
relationships with technology companies, early stage growth companies or
special industries such as wineries. In other cases, our competitors may offer
a broader range of financial products to our clients. When new competitors seek
to enter one of our markets, or when existing market participants seek to
increase their market share, they sometimes undercut the pricing and credit
terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our market share.
Our pricing and credit terms could deteriorate if we act to meet these
competitive challenges, which could adversely affect our business,
profitability, financial condition and future growth. Similarly, competitive
pressures could adversely affect the business, profitability, financial
condition and future growth of our non-banking services, including our access
to capital and attractive investment opportunities for our funds business and
our ability to secure attractive engagements in our investment banking
business.

Our ability
to maintain or increase our market share depends on our ability to meet the
needs of existing and future clients.

Our success depends, in
part, upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry
standards and to meet the needs of existing and potential future clients. A
failure to achieve market acceptance of any new products we introduce, a
failure to introduce products that the market may demand,


or the
costs associated with developing, introducing and providing new products and
services could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability and growth
prospects.

We
face risks in connection with our strategic undertakings.

If appropriate
opportunities present themselves, we may engage in strategic activities, which
could include acquisitions, joint ventures, partnerships, investments or other
undertakings. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify
appropriate opportunities, that we will be able to negotiate or finance such
activities or that such activities, if undertaken, will be successful.

In order to finance future
strategic undertakings, we might obtain additional equity or debt financing. Such
financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If
obtained, equity financing could be dilutive and the incurrence of debt and
contingent liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to execute
strategic activities successfully will depend on a variety of factors. These
factors likely will vary based on the nature of the activity but may include
our success in integrating the operations, services, products, personnel and
systems of an acquired company into our business, retaining key employees,
achieving anticipated synergies and otherwise realizing the undertaking’s
anticipated benefits. Our ability to address these matters successfully cannot
be assured. In addition, our strategic efforts may divert management’s
attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional
regulatory scrutiny.  If we do not
successfully execute a strategic undertaking, it could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.  In addition, if we were to conclude that the
value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had
been impaired, that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge
to us, which would adversely affect our results of operations.

We face risks associated with international
operations.

One
component of our strategy is to expand internationally. To date, we have opened
offices in the United Kingdom, India and China. We plan to expand our
operations in those locations and are exploring adding other locations. Our efforts
to expand our business internationally carries with it certain risks, including
risks arising from the allocation of management time and attention to these
efforts and the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenues from
foreign operations. In addition, there are certain risks inherent in doing
business on an international basis, including, among others, legal, regulatory
and tax requirements and restrictions, uncertainties regarding liability,
tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign
operations, differing technology standards or customer requirements, political
and economic risks and financial risks, including currency and payment risks.
These risks could adversely affect the success of our international operations
and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of
operation and financial condition. In addition, we face risks that our non-U.S.
based employees may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, which
could have a material adverse effect on us.

Our business
reputation is important and any damage to it could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

Our reputation is very
important to sustain our business, as we rely on our relationships with our
current, former and potential clients and stockholders, the private equity
community and the industries that we serve. Any damage to our reputation,
whether arising from regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters
affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and exchange listing
requirements, our conduct of our business or otherwise could have a material
adverse effect on our business.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters
facility consists of three buildings and is located at 3003 Tasman Drive, Santa
Clara, California. The total square footage of the premises leased under the
current lease arrangement is approximately 213,625 square feet. The term of the
lease will expire on September 30, 2014, unless terminated earlier.

We currently operate 27
regional offices in the United States and three offices outside the United
States. We operate throughout the Silicon Valley with two offices in Santa
Clara, an office in Menlo Park, and three offices in Palo Alto. Other regional
offices in California include Irvine, Woodland Hills, San Diego, San Francisco,
St. Helena, Santa Rosa, and Pleasanton. Office locations outside of California
within the United States include: Tempe, Arizona; Boulder, Colorado; Atlanta,
Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Newton, Massachusetts; Minnetonka, Minnesota; New
York, New York; Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Beaverton, Oregon; Randor,
Pennsylvania; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Vienna, Virginia; and Kirkland,
Washington. Our three foreign offices are located in: Shanghai, China;
Bangalore, India; and London, England. All of our properties are occupied under
leases, which expire at various dates through 2014, and in most instances
include options to renew or extend at market rates and terms. We also own
leasehold improvements, equipment, furniture, and fixtures at our offices, all
of which are used in our business activities.

Our Commercial Banking
operations principally operate out of our corporate headquarters in Santa
Clara, and the lending teams operate out of the various regional offices. SVB
Capital principally operates out of our office in Menlo Park, and SVB Alliant
out of one of our offices in Palo Alto. Our other businesses, including SVB
Global and SVB Private Client Services, principally operate out of our
corporate headquarters in Santa Clara; SVB Analytics principally operates out
of our office in San Francisco. Local subsidiaries of SVB Global operate out of
our offices in Bangalore and Shanghai; SVB Global’s European subsidiary
operates out of our London office, which it shares with SVB Alliant’s European
subsidiary.

We also lease an
administrative facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, which provides a parallel operating
environment for critical bank systems and functions.

We believe that our
properties are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business.

Legal
Proceedings

Certain lawsuits and
claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed or are
pending against us or our affiliates. Based upon information available to us,
our review of such claims to date and consultation with our outside legal
counsel, management believes the liability relating to these actions, if any,
will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated
financial position, or results of operations. Where appropriate, as we
determine, reserves have been established in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

(“SFAS No. 5”). The
outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently
uncertain, however, and it is possible that one or more of the legal or
regulatory matters currently pending or threatened could have a material
adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, or results of
operation.

On May 24, 2001,
Gateway Communications, Inc. (“Gateway”) filed a lawsuit in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Western Division)
naming the Bank as a defendant. Gateway (the debtor in the bankruptcy case)
alleged that the Bank’s actions in connection with a loan resulted in Gateway’s
bankruptcy, and sought $20 million in compensatory damages, punitive damages,
interest and attorneys’ fees. On June 24, 2003, the Court dismissed four
of the five counts in the complaint, including the claim for punitive damages,
leaving one breach of contract claim. The matter was settled in its entirety in
October 2006 for an amount previously accrued for in our financial statements.

Adoption
of FIN 46R in December 2003 and SFAS No. 150 in May 2003
resulted in a change of classification of trust preferred securities
distribution expense from noninterest expense to interest expense on a
prospective basis. Additionally, the adoption of FIN 46R and SFAS No. 150
resulted in a change of classification of trust preferred securities from
noninterest bearing funding sources to interest-bearing liabilities on a
prospective basis. Prior to adoption of FIN 46R and SFAS No. 150, in
accordance with accounting rules in effect at that time, we recorded trust
preferred securities distribution expense as noninterest expense. On October 30,
2003, $50.0 million in cumulative 7.0% trust preferred securities were
issued through a newly formed special purpose trust, SVB Capital II. We
received $51.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of 7.0% junior
subordinated debentures to SVB Capital II. A portion of the net proceeds were
used to redeem the existing $40.0 million of 8.25% trust preferred
securities. Approximately $1.3 million of deferred issuance costs related
to redemption of the $40.0 million 8.25% trust preferred securities were
included in interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2003.


Item 7.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Management’s discussion and analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations below contain forward-looking statements.
These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are
subject to risks and uncertainties. See our cautionary language at the
beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results could differ
materially because of various factors, including but not limited to those
discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The following discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data
as presented in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Certain reclassifications have been made to our prior years’ results to conform
to 2006 presentations. Such reclassifications had no effect on our results of
operations or stockholders’ equity

.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates

The accompanying management’s discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and
assumptions that can have a significant impact on the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, income, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing
basis and we base these estimates on historical experiences and various other
factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. The financial impact of each
estimate, to the extent significant to financial results, is discussed in the
applicable sections of management’s discussion and analysis.

Our critical accounting
policies are described below. Our senior management has discussed the
development, selection, and disclosure of these critical accounting policies
with our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Non-Marketable Securities

Non-marketable securities include investments in
private equity funds, venture debt funds and direct equity investments in
companies. At December 31, 2006, we had non-marketable securities totaling
$246.9 million, compared to $186.6 million at December 31, 2005. Our
accounting for investments in non-


marketable securities
depends on several factors, including our level of ownership/control and the
legal structure of our subsidiary making the investment. Based on these factors
we account for our non-marketable securities using one of three different
methods: (i) investment company fair value accounting; (ii) equity
method accounting; or (iii) cost method accounting.

At December 31, 2006, our non-marketable
securities carried under investment company fair value accounting totaled
$174.8 million, compared to $133.3 million at December 31, 2005. These
investments are carried at estimated fair value at each balance sheet date
based primarily on financial information obtained as the general partner of the
fund or obtained from the funds’ respective general partner. We utilize the
most recent available financial information and valuations generally remain at
cost until such time that there is significant evidence of a change in value
based upon consideration of the relevant market conditions, offering prices,
operating results, financial conditions, exit strategies, and other pertinent
information. We consider our accounting policy for our non-marketable
securities carried under investment company fair value to be critical as
estimating the fair value of these investments requires management to make
assumptions regarding future performance, financial condition, and relevant
market conditions, along with other pertinent information. In addition, for our
private equity fund investments, there is a time lag in our receipt of
financial information from the investee’s general partner, which we use as the
primary basis for valuation of these investments.

Our equity method non-marketable securities totaled
$38.4 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $22.7 million at December 31,
2005. Under our equity method accounting, we recognize our proportionate share
of the results of operations of each equity method investee in its results of
operations.

Our cost method non-marketable securities totaled
$33.7 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $30.6 million at December 31,
2005. Under our cost method accounting, we record investments at cost and
recognize as income distributions or returns received from net accumulated
earnings of the investee since the date of acquisition.

We consider our accounting policy for our
non-marketable securities to be critical because the valuation of these
investments is subject to management judgment. The inherent uncertainty in the
process of valuing equity securities for which a ready market is unavailable
may cause our estimated values of these securities to differ significantly from
the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the securities
existed, and those differences could be material. Future adverse changes in
market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could
result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the
investments that may not be reflected in an investment’s carrying value,
thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.

We review our equity and
cost method securities at least quarterly for indicators of impairment, which
requires significant judgment. The indicators that we use include an analysis
of facts and circumstances of each investment, the expectations of the
investment’s future cash flows and capital needs, variability of its business
and the company’s exit strategy. Investments identified as having an indicator
of impairment are reviewed further to determine if the investment is other than
temporarily impaired. We reduce the investment value when we consider declines
in value to be other than temporary and we recognize the estimated loss as a
loss on investment securities, which is a component of noninterest income.

Derivative Assets—Equity Warrant Assets for Shares of
Privately- and Publicly-held Companies

At December 31, 2006, our equity warrant assets
totaled $37.7 million, compared to $27.8 million at December 31, 2005. Equity
warrant assets for shares of private and public companies are recorded at fair
value on the grant date and adjusted to fair value on a quarterly basis through
consolidated net income.


We account for equity warrant assets with net
settlement terms in certain private and public client companies as derivatives.
In general, equity warrant assets entitle us to buy a specific number of shares
of stock at a specific price over a specific time period.

Certain equity warrant
assets contain contingent provisions, which adjust the underlying number of
shares or strike price upon the occurrence of certain future events. Our
warrant agreements contain net share settlement provisions, which permit us to
receive at exercise a share count equal to the intrinsic value of the warrant
divided by the share price (otherwise known as a “cashless” exercise). Because we can net settle
our warrant agreements, our equity warrant assets qualify as derivative instruments
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

,
as amended (“SFAS No. 133”).

The fair value of
the equity warrant assets portfolio is reviewed quarterly. We value our equity
warrant assets using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model, which
incorporates the following material assumptions:

·

Underlying
asset value was estimated based on information available, including any
information regarding subsequent rounds of funding.

·

Volatility,
or the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of the changes in the
warrant price, was based on guidelines for publicly traded companies within
indices similar in nature to the underlying client companies issuing the
warrant. A total of ten such indices were used. The volatility assumption was
based on the median volatility for an individual public company within an index
for each quarter from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2006, from
which an average volatility was derived. The weighted average quarterly median
volatility assumption used for the warrant valuation at December 31, 2006
was 42.1%, compared to 47.4% at December 31, 2005.

·

Actual
data on cancellations, expirations and exercises of our equity warrant assets
was utilized as the basis for determining the expected remaining life of the equity
warrant assets in each financial reporting period. Equity warrant assets may be
exercised in the event of acquisitions, mergers or IPOs, and cancelled due to
events such as bankruptcies, restructuring activities or additional financings.
This assumption reduced the reported value of the warrant portfolio by $12.4
million at December 31, 2006.

·

The
risk-free interest rates were derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The
risk-free interest rate was calculated based on a weighted average of the
risk-free interest rates that correspond closest to the expected remaining life
of the warrant.

·

Other
adjustments were estimated based on management’s judgment about the general
industry environment combined with specific information about the issuing
company, when available.


The
fair value of our equity warrant assets recorded on our balance sheets
represents our best estimate of the fair value of these instruments within the
framework of existing accounting standards and guidance provided by the SEC on
fair value accounting. Changes in the above material assumptions will result in
significantly different valuations. For example, the following table
demonstrates the effect of changes in the risk-free interest rate and
volatility assumptions:

Valuation

2006 is as follows (1):

The
above table does not include equity warrant assets at December 31, 2006
held by Partners for Growth, which were valued at $1.5 million, based on 35.3%
volatility and a 4.8% risk-free interest rate.

The timing and value
realized from the disposition of equity warrant assets depend upon factors
beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying portfolio
companies, investor demand for IPOs, fluctuations in the market prices of the
underlying common stock of these companies, levels of mergers and acquisitions
activity, and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the
underlying securities. All of these factors are difficult to predict. Due to
the composition of our portfolio of equity warrant assets, it is likely that
many of them will become impaired. However, we are not in a position to know at
the present time which specific equity warrant assets are likely to be impaired
or the extent or timing of individual impairments. Therefore, we cannot predict
future gains or losses with any degree of accuracy, and any gains or losses
could vary materially from period to period.

We consider accounting
policies related to equity warrant assets to be critical as the valuation of
these assets is complex and subject to a certain degree of management judgment.
Management has the ability to select from several valuation methodologies and
has alternative approaches in the calculation of material assumptions. The
selection of an alternative valuation methodology or alternative approaches
used to calculate material assumptions in the current methodology may cause our
estimated values of these assets to differ significantly from the values
recorded. Additionally, the inherent uncertainty in the process of valuing
these assets for which a ready market is unavailable may cause our estimated
values of these assets to differ significantly from the values that would have
been derived had a ready market for the assets existed, and those differences
could be material.

Allowance for Loan
Losses

At December 31, 2006,
our allowance for loan losses totaled $42.7 million, compared to $36.8 million
at December 31, 2005. The allowance for loan losses is management’s
estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at a balance sheet
date.

We consider our accounting
policy for the allowance for loan losses to be critical as estimation of the
allowance involves material estimates by our management and is particularly
susceptible to significant changes in the near term. Determining the allowance
for loan losses requires us to make forecasts that are highly uncertain and require
a high degree of judgment. Our loan loss reserve methodology is applied to our
allowance for loan losses and we maintain the balances at levels that we
believe to be adequate to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in our loan
portfolios.


Our allowance for loan
losses is established for loan losses that are probable but not yet realized.
The process of anticipating loan losses is imprecise. Our management applies a
systematic process for the evaluation of individual loans and pools of loans for
inherent risk of loan losses. On a quarterly basis, each loan in our portfolio
is assigned a credit risk rating through an evaluation process, which includes
consideration of such factors as payment status, the financial condition of the
borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral
values, potential loan concentrations, and general economic conditions. The
allowance for loan losses is based on a formula allocation for similarly
risk-rated loans by client industry
sector

and for individually
impaired loans as determined by SFAS No. 114,

Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan

(“SFAS No. 114”), and SFAS No. 5.

Our evaluation process is
designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. We assess
the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis by
utilizing a historical loan loss migration model, which is a statistical model
used to estimate an appropriate allowance for outstanding loan balances by
calculating the likelihood of a loan becoming charged-off based on its credit
risk rating using historical loan performance data from our portfolio. Loan
loss factors for each risk-rating category and client industry sector are
ultimately applied to the respective period-end client loan balances for each
corresponding risk-rating category by client industry sector to provide an
estimation of the allowance for loan losses.

We
apply macro allocations to the results we obtained through our historical loan
loss migration model to ascertain the total allowance for loan losses. These
macro allocations are based upon management’s assessment of the risks that may
lead to a future loan loss experience different from our historical loan loss
experience. These risks are aggregated to become our macro allocation. Based on
management’s prediction or estimate of changing risks in the lending
environment, the macro allocation may vary significantly from period to period
and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of the following factors:

·

Changes
in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and
collections, and charge-off and recovery practices;

·

Changes
in national and local economic business conditions, including the market and
economic condition of our clients’ industry sectors;

·

Changes
in the nature of our loan portfolio;

·

Changes
in experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff;

·

Changes
in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans;

·

Changes
in the trend of the volume of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings,
and other loan modifications; and

·

Other
factors as determined by management from time to time.

Finally, we compute
several modified versions of the model, which provide additional assurance that
the statistical results of the historical loan loss migration model are
reasonable. A committee comprised of senior management evaluates the adequacy
of the allowance for loan losses based on the results of our analysis.

Allowance for
Unfunded Credit Commitments

We consider our accounting
policy for the allowance for unfunded credit commitments to be critical as
estimation of the allowance involves material estimates by our management and
is particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term. We record
a liability for probable and estimatable losses associated with our unfunded
loan commitments. Each quarter, every unfunded client credit commitment is
allocated to a credit risk-rating category in accordance with each client’s
credit risk rating.


We use
the historical loan loss factors described under our Allowance for Loan Losses
to calculate the possible loan loss experience if unfunded credit commitments
are funded. Separately, we use historical trends to calculate the probability
of an unfunded credit commitment being funded. We apply the loan funding
probability factor to risk-factor adjusted unfunded commitments by credit
risk-rating to derive the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The allowance
for unfunded credit commitments may also include certain macro allocations as
deemed appropriate by management. Our allowance for unfunded credit commitments
totaled $14.7 million and $17.1 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005
respectively, and is reflected in other liabilities on our balance sheet.

Goodwill

Goodwill, which arises
from the purchase price exceeding the assigned value of the net assets of an
acquired business, represents the value attributable to unidentifiable
intangible elements being acquired. At December 31, 2006, our consolidated
balance sheet included $21.3 million of goodwill, which resulted from our
acquisitions of SVB Alliant, our investment banking subsidiary, and eProsper,
our equity ownership data management services company. Goodwill at December 31,
2005 totaled $35.6 million.

On an annual basis or as
circumstances dictate, management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or
other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount. We
consider our accounting policy on goodwill to be critical because the valuation
methodology for potential impairments is inherently complex and involves
significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions.

The impairment tests for
goodwill are performed at the reporting unit level and require us to perform a
two-step impairment test. First, we compare the aggregate fair value of our
reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value
exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of
the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then we perform the second step of
the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the
reporting unit’s goodwill. We estimate the reporting unit’s implied fair value
by using a discounted cash flow approach. These estimates involve many
assumptions, including expected results of operations and assumed discount
rates. These discount rates are based on standard industry practice, taking into
account the expected equity risk premium, the size of the business and the
probability of the reporting unit achieving its financial forecasts. If the
carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair
value, then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing goodwill down to the
implied fair value.

Events that may indicate
goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in the results of
operations of the business, or in the economic or political climate, an adverse
action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, and a
more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or disposed
of. As a result of our annual impairment test for SVB Alliant conducted in June 2006,
we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $18.4 million due to changes in
staffing in early 2006 and lowered expectations of future revenue streams.

Share-Based
Compensation

At December 31, 2006
our share-based compensation expense totaled $21.3 million, compared to $7.1
million at December 31, 2005. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), we measure
compensation expense for all employee share-based payment awards using a fair
value based method, reduced by estimated award forfeitures and recording such
expense in our consolidated statements of operations. We currently estimate the
fair value of our employee share-based payments on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model.

We consider our accounting
policy for share-based compensation to be critical as determining the fair
value of awards involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. While
fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock, market quotes are
not available for long-term, nontransferable stock


options
because these instruments are not traded. In addition, valuation models require
the input of highly subjective assumptions, and the Black-Scholes option
pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Because
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of
traded options, changes to the input assumptions can materially affect the fair
value of our employee stock options.

The use of the Black-Scholes
option pricing model requires a number of complex assumptions including
expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and expected
dividends. The most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected
volatility and the expected term of the award. The value of a stock option is
derived from its potential for appreciation. The more volatile the stock, the
more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of
significant changes in stock price. Because there is an active market for
options on our Common Stock, we have considered implied volatilities as well as
our historical realized volatilities when developing an estimate of expected
volatility. The expected term also has a significant effect on the value of the
option. The longer the term, the more time the option holder has to allow the
stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus, the more valuable
the option. Further, lengthier option terms provide more opportunity to exploit
market highs. However, employees are not required to wait until the end of the
contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise. Accordingly, we are
required to estimate the expected term of the option. When establishing an
estimate of the expected term, we consider actual employee exercise behavior
and post-vesting turnover rates, along with expected volatilities factors and
risk-free interest rates. As required under the accounting rules, we review our
valuation assumptions at each grant date and, as a result, we are likely to
change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in
future periods. Changes to the subjective input assumptions could materially
affect the estimated fair value of our stock-based payments.

Income Taxes

Our income tax expense
totaled $65.8 million and $60.8 million for the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively.

We are subject to income
tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the
foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We consider our accounting policy
relating to income taxes to be critical as the determination of current and
deferred income taxes is based on complex analyses of many factors including
interpretation of federal, state and foreign income tax laws, the difference
between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities (temporary
differences), estimates of amounts due or owed, the timing of reversals of
temporary differences and current financial accounting standards. Actual
results could differ significantly from the estimates due to tax law
interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax
liabilities. Additionally, there can be no assurances that estimates and
interpretations used in determining income tax liabilities may not be
challenged by federal and state taxing authorities.

In establishing a
provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations
about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make
estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in
the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. We evaluate our
income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5. We believe that
our reserve for income tax liabilities, including related interest, is adequate
in relation to the potential for additional tax assessments.

We are also subject to
routine corporate tax audits by the various tax jurisdictions. Although we
believe that our tax return positions are reasonable, we believe that certain
positions could be challenged and may not be fully sustained on review by tax
authorities. We review our reserves quarterly, and we may adjust these reserves
in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax
audit or the refinement of an estimate, and to the extent that the final tax
outcome of these matters is different than


the
amounts recorded, such differences will impact income tax expense in the period
in which such determination is made.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2006, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and

(“SFAS No. 155”). Hybrid financial instruments are
financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative within a single
instrument. SFAS No. 155 gives entities an option to elect to record
hybrid financial instruments at fair value as one financial instrument. Prior
to this amendment, under certain conditions, hybrid financial instruments were
required to be separated into two instruments, a derivative and host, and
generally only the derivative was recorded at fair value. SFAS No. 155
requires that beneficial interests in securitized assets be evaluated for
derivatives, either freestanding or embedded. In January 2007, the FASB
provided a scope exception for securitized interests that (1) only contain
an embedded derivative that is tied to the prepayment risk of the underlying
prepayable financial assets and (2) the investor does not control the
right to accelerate the settlement. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all
financial instruments acquired or issued after January 1, 2007.
Additionally, SFAS No. 155 provides a one-time opportunity to apply the
fair value election to hybrid financial instruments existing at the date of
implementation at fair value as one financial instrument, with any difference
between the carrying amount of the existing hybrid financial instruments and
the fair value of the single financial instrument being recorded as a
cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. We do not expect
the adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position and results of operations.

In March 2006, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 156,

Accounting for Servicing
of Financial Assets, an amendment of SFAS No. 140

(“SFAS No. 156”).
SFAS No. 156 clarifies when an entity should separately recognize
servicing assets and servicing liabilities when it undertakes an obligation to
service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract. SFAS No. 156
requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing
liabilities be initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured using
either the amortization method as previously permitted under SFAS No. 140
or the fair value measurement method. Entities are permitted to make an
election to subsequently re-measure classes of separately recognized servicing
assets and liabilities. Once the fair value measurement method is elected for a
class, the election should be applied prospectively to all new and existing
separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities within that
class. The effect of re-measuring an existing class of separately recognized
servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value would be reported as a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the
fiscal year of adoption. SFAS No. 156 is effective as of the beginning of
an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. Earlier
adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year, provided
the entity has not yet issued interim financial statements for that fiscal
year. In the first quarter of 2006, we elected not to early adopt this
Statement and, accordingly, will adopt it as of January 1, 2007. We are
currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 156 on our consolidated
financial position and results of operations.

In July 2006, the
FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,

Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), to clarify the accounting for uncertain tax positions. FIN 48
prescribes that a two-step benefit recognition model be applied initially to
recognize and measure the benefit amount of a tax position. The first step
requires that a tax benefit be recognized only when the tax position is “more-likely-than-not”
to be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. Assuming the
first step is met, the second step requires that the benefit amount be measured
at the largest amount that has at least a “more-likely-than-not” likelihood of
being the ultimate outcome based on a cumulative-probability approach. Tax
positions that previously failed to meet the “more-likely-than-not” recognition
threshold should be recognized in the period in which the threshold is
subsequently met, the tax matter is resolved or the statute of limitations for
examining the tax position has expired. FIN 48 requires that a previously
recognized tax benefit be de-recognized in the period it becomes


“more-likely-than-not”
that the tax position would not be sustained on audit. The FASB is currently
engaged in a project to provide implementation guidance on FIN 48. While the
effects of FIN 48 will depend somewhat upon this implementation guidance, we
expect the transition effects of this standard to be modest with an immaterial
impact on our opening balance of retained earnings at January 1, 2007.

In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing
the impact of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial position and
results of operations.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Income
and Margin (Fully Taxable-Equivalent Basis)

Net interest income is
defined as the difference between interest earned primarily on loans,
investment securities, securities purchased under agreement to resell and other
short-term investment securities, and interest paid on funding sources. Net
interest income is our principal source of revenue. Net interest margin is
defined as the amount of annualized net interest income, on a fully
taxable-equivalent basis, expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning
assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully
taxable-equivalent basis to consistently reflect income from taxable loans and
securities and tax-exempt securities based on the federal statutory tax rate of
35.0%.

Net Interest Income (Fully Taxable-Equivalent Basis)

Net interest income of
$354.1 million for 2006 increased by $52.8 million or 17.5 percent, from $301.3
million in 2005, which increased by
$69.1 million or 29.8 percent, from $232.2 million in 2004. The increase
in net interest income in 2006 was primarily due to a $79.7 million increase in
income from our loan portfolio, partially offset by a $10.5 million decrease in
interest income from our investment securities portfolio and an increase in
interest expense of $18.0 million. The
increase in net interest income in 2005 was primarily due to a $61.7 million
increase in income from our loan portfolio and a $12.1 million increase in
interest income from our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by
an increase in interest expense of $5.8 million.

The increases in interest
income from our loan portfolio in 2006 and 2005 are primarily related to growth
in our loan portfolio as well as the effect of increases in our base prime
lending rate during 2006 and 2005. Average loans outstanding during 2006
totaled $2.88 billion, compared to $2.37 billion during 2005 and $1.95 billion during 2004. The
increase in average loans outstanding of $513.7 million during 2006 and $416.7 million during 2005 was driven
by our commercial loan portfolio, which increased $450.1 million in 2006 and $355.5 million in 2005 as a result of
our increased focus on serving middle-market clients and improvement in economic activity in the
markets served by us. We increased our base prime lending rate four
times in 2006 and eight times in 2005, each time by 25 basis points, in
response to increases in short-term market interest rates. Our base prime
lending rate was 8.25 percent as of December 31, 2006, compared to 7.25
percent in 2005 and 5.25 percent in 2004. Our average base prime lending rate increased
to 7.95 percent in 2006 from 6.18 percent in 2005 and 4.34 percent in 2004. The average yield on our loan portfolio
was 10.37 percent in 2006, compared to 9.26 percent in 2005 and 8.08 percent in 2004.

The decrease in interest
income from our investment securities portfolio during 2006 reflects lower
levels of investment securities due to scheduled maturities and prepayments as
well as the sale of $119.1 million of certain available-for-sale investment
securities during the second quarter of 2006. Average investment securities
decreased by $300.0 million from $1.98 billion in 2005 to $1.68 billion in 2006
as a result of our use of portfolio cash flows to support the growth of our
loan portfolio.


The increase in interest income from our investment
securities portfolio during 2005 reflects higher levels of investment
securities, as well as a change in the composition of our investment portfolio.
Average investment securities increased by $230.3 million during 2005. During
2005, we adjusted the composition of a portion of the investment portfolio to a
slightly higher concentration of higher-yielding, mortgage-backed securities
and collateralized mortgage obligations.

The increase in interest expense during 2006 is
primarily related to increases in short-term borrowings and other long-term
debt. Average short-term borrowings increased $331.4 million during 2006 to
$400.9 million while average other long-term debt increased $9.7 million
to $17.7 million. The increases in short-term borrowings and other long-term
debt were used to fund the growth of our loan portfolio.

The increase in interest
expense during 2005 is primarily related to increases in short-term borrowings
and increased rates paid on money market accounts. Average short-term
borrowings were $69.5 million during 2005, while there were no short-term
borrowings during 2004. The average rates paid on our money market deposits
increased from 0.50 percent in 2004 to 0.70 percent in 2005 and the average
rates paid on our bonus money market deposits increased from 0.50 percent in
2004 to 0.76 percent in 2005. We increased the interest rates on these products
due to increases in short-term market interest rates.

Net Interest Margin
(Fully Taxable-Equivalent Basis)

Net interest margin was
7.38 percent for 2006, compared to 6.46 percent for 2005 and 5.39 percent
for 2004. The increases in net interest margin during 2006 and 2005 were
largely due to growth and increases in yields of our loan portfolio as well as
growth of our noninterest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by
increases in the balances outstanding of our short-term borrowings. Noninterest-bearing
demand deposits, a significant source of funding for us, increased $148.9
million and $340.6 million during 2006 and 2005, respectively.


Average Balances, Yields and Rates Paid (Fully
Taxable-Equivalent Basis)

The
average yield earned on interest-earning assets is the amount of annualized
fully taxable-equivalent interest income expressed as a percentage of average
interest-earning assets. The average rate paid on funding sources is the amount
of annualized interest expense expressed as a percentage of average funding
sources. The following table sets forth average assets, liabilities, minority
interest and stockholders’ equity, interest income, interest expense,
annualized yields and rates, and the composition of our annualized net interest
margin for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Analysis of Interest Changes Due to Volume and Rate
(Fully Taxable-Equivalent Basis)

Net
interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “volume
change.” Net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on
interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities,
referred to as “rate change”. The following table sets forth changes in
interest income for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest
expense for each major category of interest-bearing liabilities. The table also
reflects the amount of simultaneous changes attributable to both volume and
rate changes for the years indicated. For this table, changes that are not
solely due to either volume or rate are allocated in proportion to the
percentage changes in average volume and average rate.

Provision for (Recovery of) Loan Losses

The provision for loan losses is based on our
evaluation of the adequacy of the existing allowance for loan losses in
relation to total loans and on our periodic assessment of the inherent and
identified risk dynamics of the loan portfolio resulting from reviews of
selected individual loans. For a more detailed discussion of credit quality and
the allowance for loan losses, see Item 7. Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates and Item 7. Consolidated Financial Condition—Credit Quality and the
Allowance for Loan Losses.

We recorded a provision for loan losses of $9.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to a provision of
$0.2 million in 2005 and a recovery of $10.3 million in 2004. The increase in
provision for loan losses in 2006 is primarily related to the growth in our
loan portfolio.

We realized net
charge-offs of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared
to $1.1 million of net recoveries in 2005 and net charge-offs of $2.0
million in 2004. Credit quality remained strong with nonperforming loans at
0.31% of total gross loans as of December 31, 2006, compared to 0.26% in
2005 and 0.64% in 2004.

Client Investment
Fees

We offer a variety of investment products on which we
earn fees. These products include sweep money market funds, money market mutual
funds, overnight repurchase agreements and fixed income securities available
through client-directed accounts, and fixed income management services offered
through our investment advisory subsidiary.

Client investment fees totaled $44.3 million

for
the year ended December 31, 2006,
compared to $33.3 million for 2005 and $26.9 million for 2004. The
increase of $11.0 million and $6.3 million in client investment fees during
2006 and 2005, respectively, was attributable to the growth in average client investment funds. The
following table summarizes average client investment funds for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004.

Foreign Exchange
Fees

Foreign exchange fees
represent the income differential between purchases and sales of foreign
currency exchange on behalf of our clients. Foreign exchange fees totaled $21.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $17.9 million
for 2005 and $12.9 million for 2004. The increases in foreign exchange fees
during 2006 and 2005 were attributable to increases in the volume of client
foreign exchange transactions. We believe that a general improvement in
business conditions for many of our clients and increased international trading
were the primary drivers behind a higher volume of client foreign exchange transactions.
Foreign exchange fees were previously presented as a component of gains on
derivative instruments, net, within noninterest income in the consolidated
statements of income.


Gains on Derivative
Instruments, Net

Gains
on derivative instruments, net, totaled $17.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2006, compared to $6.8 million for 2005 and $3.4 million for 2004. The increase
of $11.1 million for 2006, compared to 2005, was primarily due to favorable
changes in the fair value of equity warrant assets, which was partially offset
by an unfavorable change in the fair value hedge agreement for our junior
subordinated debentures and a decrease in gains from foreign exchange forwards
used to reduce our exposure to foreign currency denominated loans. A summary of
gains on derivative instruments, net, for the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004 is as follows:

exchange forward contracts with correspondent banks to economically reduce
foreign exchange exposure risk related to certain foreign currency denominated
loans. Revaluations of foreign currency denominated loans are recorded on the
line item “Other” as part of noninterest income, a component of consolidated
net income.

(2)

Represents the change in
the fair value hedge agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the
amount is comprised of a $3.3 million loss for the interest rate swap agreement
prior to its designation as a fair value hedge and a $0.3 million loss for the
fair value hedge agreement.

(3)

As of December 31,
2006, the Company held warrants in 1,287 companies, compared to 1,281 companies
in 2005 and 1,362 companies in 2004.

(4)

Includes net gains on
equity warrant assets held by consolidated investment affiliates. Relevant
amounts attributable to minority interests are reflected in the interim
consolidated statements of income under the caption “Minority Interest in Net
(Income) Losses of Consolidated Affiliates”.

The change in fair value
of equity warrant assets is primarily attributable to changes in the value of
the underlying assumptions used to value the equity warrant assets including:
changes in the risk-free interest rate, changes in the underlying value of the
client companies’ stock, changes in the volatility of market comparable public
companies and changes in the expected life. The methodology used to calculate
the fair value of equity warrant assets has been applied consistently.


Corporate Finance
Fees

Corporate finance fees for
the year ended December 31, 2006 were $11.6 million, compared to
$22.1 million in 2005 and $22.0 million in 2004. The decrease in 2006 is
principally a result of changes in staffing at SVB Alliant that occurred in
early 2006.

Deposit Service
Charges

Deposit service charges
for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $10.2 million, compared to $9.8
million in 2005 and $13.5 million in 2004. The increase in 2006 was
attributable to an increase in fee rates, partially offset by an increase in
credits obtained by clients to offset deposit service charges, which resulted
from increases in short-term market interest rates. The decrease in 2005 is a
result of increases in short-term market interest rates, which resulted in our
clients obtaining additional credits to offset deposit service charges.

Gains on Investment
Securities, Net

Gains on investment
securities, net, were $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
compared to $4.3 million for 2005 and $5.2 million for 2004. The net gain on
investment securities during 2006 included $5.7 million net gains on private
equity fund investments and a $0.2 million gain from the sale of equity
securities obtained after the exercise of warrants, partially offset by a loss
of $3.2 million due to the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities.
The net gains of $5.7 million on our private equity investments related to
gains on distributions from private equity fund investments. Gains on
investment securities, net, of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2005 were principally derived from the changes in fair value and realized sales
of non-marketable securities related to net gains from private equity fund
investments of $5.1 million, net gains from private equity investments of $1.7
million, and net losses of $2.1 million from the sale of certain
available-for-sale investment securities. We expect continued variability in
the performance of our equity securities and venture debt portfolios. Relevant
amounts attributable to minority interests are reflected in the interim
consolidated statements of income under the caption “Minority Interest in Net
(Income) Losses of Consolidated Affiliates”. As of December 31, 2006, the
Company held investments, either directly or through its managed investment
funds, in 361 private equity funds, 46 companies and three venture debt funds.

Other Income

Other income for the year ended December 31, 2006
was $23.6 million, compared to $13.4 million in 2005 and $13.8 million in 2004.
Other income largely consisted of credit card fees, fund management fees, service-based
fee income associated with our deposit and loan services, net change in
revaluations of foreign currency denominated loans and unused commitment fees.
The increase of $10.2 million in 2006 primarily relates to a positive net
change of $4.4 million from revaluations of foreign currency denominated loans,
an increase in unused commitment fees of $2.1 million and an increase in fund
management fees of $1.2 million.

Compensation and
Benefits

Compensation and benefits
expense totaled $188.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
compared to $163.6 million for 2005 and $153.9 million for 2004. The increase
in compensation and benefits expense in 2006 was largely due to our adoption of
SFAS No. 123(R), increases in average full-time equivalent (“FTE”)
employees and higher rates of employee salaries and wages, partially offset by
a decline in contributions to our incentive compensation plan. SFAS No. 123(R) requires
us to recognize expense for stock options granted and Employee Stock Purchase
Plan shares. Share-based compensation expense totaled $21.3 million for 2006,
compared to $7.1 million for 2005 and $3.5 million for 2004. Average FTE
personnel increased by 58 to 1,087 in 2006 from 1,029 in 2005 and 998 in 2004.
Our total contributions to our incentive compensation plan were $24.5 million,
$26.6 million, and $28.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

Professional
Services

Professional services
expense totaled $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
compared to $28.7 million in 2005 and $17.1 million in 2004. The increase of
$12.1 million in 2006 was primarily related to consulting costs incurred as
part of ongoing efforts to enhance and maintain compliance with various
regulations as well as expenses associated with certain Information Technology
(“IT”) projects. The increase of $11.6 million in 2005 was associated with the
commitment of resources to amend and restate our Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2004, the commitment of resources to document,
enhance and audit internal controls to accomplish and adhere to the provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the independent audit of our internal
controls, and expenses associated with certain IT projects.

Impairment of
Goodwill

In connection with our
annual assessment of goodwill of SVB Alliant, we recognized an impairment
charge of $18.4 million during the second quarter of 2006. The impairment
resulted from changes in our outlook for SVB Alliant’s future financial
performance due to changes in staffing in early 2006 and lowered expectations
of future revenue streams. In 2004, we recognized an impairment charge of $1.9
million related to a private client services subsidiary, which we sold in 2006.


Net Occupancy

Net occupancy expense
totaled $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to
$16.2 million for 2005 and $18.1 million for 2004. Net occupancy expense
increased during 2006 primarily due to the opening of our administrative
facility in Salt Lake City. Net occupancy expense decreased in 2005 as a result
of renegotiating more favorable lease terms related to our corporate
headquarters facility in Santa Clara, California.

Furniture and
Equipment

Furniture and equipment
expense totaled $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
compared to $12.8 million in 2005 and $12.4 million in 2004. The increase in
2006 was primarily related to the opening of our administrative facility in
Salt Lake City, office relocations and information technology initiatives.

Business
Development and Travel Expense

Business development and
travel expense totaled $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
compared to $10.6 million in 2005 and $9.7 million in 2004. The increase of
$2.2 million in 2006 is attributable to investment in business development by
all of our business units.

(Reduction of)
Provision for Unfunded Credit Commitments

We calculate the provision
for unfunded credit commitments based on the credit commitments outstanding at
the balance sheet date as well as the credit quality of our loan commitments. We
recorded a net reduction of $2.5 million to the liability for unfunded credit
commitments for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to a provision
of $0.9 million for 2005 and a provision of $1.5 million for 2004. The net
reduction in the provision during the year ended December 31, 2006 is
primarily due to a refinement of the methodology related to a change in
estimate of funding percentages used to estimate the liability for unfunded
credit commitments.

Other Expense

Other expense for the year
ended December 31, 2006 totaled $17.7 million, compared to $13.6 million
in 2005 and $14.8 million in 2004. The increase of $4.1 million in 2006
primarily relates to a $1.8 million charge in connection with the settlement of
a litigation matter and increases of $0.9 million related to postage and
supplies expense.

Minority Interest in Net Income of Consolidated
Affiliates

Minority
interest in the net income of consolidated affiliates is primarily related to the
minority interest holders portion of investment gains or losses and management
fees in our managed funds (see Part II, Item 8, Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7. Investment Securities).

Minority interest in net
income of consolidated affiliates was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2006, compared to net income of $3.4 million for 2005 and net income of $3.1
million for 2004. Minority interest in net income during 2006 was primarily due
to gains on sales of investment


securities,
interest income and an increase in the value of warrant assets held by
consolidated affiliates. In addition, total minority interest in capital of
consolidated affiliates increased due to equity transactions, which included
capital calls of $61.8 million by our consolidated affiliates, partially offset
by distributions of $20.4 million and a $6.3 million increase in net income of
consolidated affiliates.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate for
2006 was 42.45 percent, compared to 39.63 percent for 2005 and 37.76 percent for
2004. The increase in the tax rate in 2006 was primarily attributable to the
tax impact of SFAS 123(R) for share-based payments on our overall pre-tax
income. The increase in the tax rate in 2005 was due to the lower benefit of
tax-advantaged investments on the overall pre-tax income in comparison to 2004.

Operating Segment Results

In accordance with SFAS No. 131, we report
segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach
designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and
assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Please refer to
the discussion of our segment organization in “Part I, Item 1. Business
Overview”.

Our primary source of
revenue is from net interest income. Accordingly, our segments are reported
using net interest income, net of funds transfer pricing (“FTP”). FTP is an
internal measurement framework designed to assess the financial impact of a
financial institution’s sources and uses of funds. It is the mechanism by which
an earnings credit is given for deposits raised, and an earnings charge is made
for funded loans. We also evaluate performance based on noninterest income and
noninterest expense, which are presented as components of segment operating
profit or loss. We do not allocate income taxes to our segments. Additionally,
our management reporting model is predicated on average asset balances;
therefore, period-end asset balances are not presented for segment reporting
purposes. The following is our segment information for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004.

Commercial Banking

Income Before Income Tax Expense

Commercial Banking’s income before income tax expense
for 2006 was $150.4 million, compared to $130.9 million for 2005 and $79.9
million for 2004. The increase for 2006, compared to 2005 was the result of
higher net revenues of $66.3 million, offset by higher noninterest expense of
$41.5 million and an increase in the provision for loan losses of $5.3 million.
The increase for 2005, compared to 2004 was primarily the result of higher net
revenues of $67.6 million, offset by higher noninterest expense of $19.1
million.

Net interest income for 2006 was $280.0 million,
compared to $229.7 million for 2005 and $169.2 million for 2004. The increase
in 2006 and 2005 were driven by higher loan volumes along with higher interest
rates. Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans,
net of funds transfer pricing and interest paid on deposits, net of funds
transfer pricing.

Net loan loss charge-offs for 2006 were $4.9 million,
compared to net loan recoveries of $0.3 million for 2005 and net loan loss
charge-offs of $2.1 million in 2004.

Noninterest income was $98.0 million for 2006,
compared to $82.0 million for 2005 and $74.9 million for 2004. The increase for
2006, compared to 2005 was primarily driven by increases in client investment
fees of $9.5 million, letter of credit and foreign exchange fees of $3.2
million and other noninterest income of $3.4 million. The increase for 2005,
compared to 2004 was primarily driven by increases in client investment fees of
$5.9 million, letter of credit and foreign exchange fees of $3.4 million, and exercises
of


equity warrant assets of
$1.7 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in deposit services fees
of $3.9 million.

Noninterest expense was
$222.7 million for 2006, compared to $181.2 million for 2005 and $162.1 million
for 2004. The increase for 2006, compared to 2005 was primarily related to a
$30.3 million increase in allocated expenses, a $4.8 million increase in
compensation and benefits and a $1.4 million increase in depreciation expense.
Allocated expenses are non-interest expenses allocated to the business units
and include facility costs, general administrative and operational overhead
expenses. The increase in allocated expenses in 2006, compared to 2005 was
primarily related to increases in compensation costs, specifically share-based
payments, and consulting expenses related to compliance. The increase in
compensation and benefits expense of $4.8 million is primarily related to
increases in base compensation of $1.9 million, incentive compensation of $1.0
million and employee relocation of $1.0 million. The increase in noninterest
expense for 2005, compared to 2004 was primarily related to an $11.0 million
increase in allocated expenses, a $5.0 million increase in correspondent bank
fees, and a $4.5 million increase in compensation and benefits. The increase in
allocated expenses in 2005, compared to 2004 was primarily related to increases
in variable compensation costs and consulting expenses related to the
restatement of our consolidated annual financial statements. The increase in
compensation and benefits of $4.5 million is primarily related to increases in
base compensation of $2.4 million, incentive compensation of $1.6 million and
benefits of $0.7 million. In 2005, we started recording correspondent bank fees
by client, which allowed us to report the fee expense in the appropriate
business segment. Prior to 2005, correspondent bank fees were not recorded by
client, and such historical data is not available; therefore the fees for 2004
were reported in Other Business Services and were not allocated to the business
segments.

Financial Condition

Commercial Banking’s average loans were $2.4 billion
in 2006, compared to $2.0 billion in 2005 and $1.6 billion in 2004. The loan
products with the largest growth in 2006, compared to 2005, were commercial
loans, which grew by $270.6 million, and asset-based lending, which grew by
$118.1 million. The loan products with the largest growth in 2005, compared to
2004 were core commercial products, which grew by $232.1 million, asset-based
lending, which grew by $80.9 million, and accounts receivable factoring, which
grew by $53.1 million. The increase in average loans reflects an improved
funding environment for our venture capital-backed commercial clients.

Average deposits were $3.1
billion in 2006, compared to $3.3 billion in 2005 and $3.2 billion in 2004. The
decrease for 2006, compared to 2005 was primarily due to clients seeking higher
returns on deposits as a result of recent increases in short-term market
interest rates.

SVB Capital

Income Before Income Tax Expense

SVB Capital’s income before income tax expense for
2006 was $26.9 million, compared to income of $11.4 million for 2005 and a loss
of $0.9 million for 2004. The increase in 2006 and 2005 was primarily
attributable to increases in interest income and noninterest income, partially
offset by an increase in noninterest expense.

Net interest income was $31.3 million for 2006,
compared to $21.8 million for 2005 and $11.9 million for 2004. The increase for
2006, compared to 2005 was driven by higher loan volumes along with higher
interest rates. The increase for 2005, compared to 2004 was driven by higher
deposit volumes from our private equity clients along with higher interest
rates.

Noninterest income was $16.5 million for 2006,
compared to $9.0 million for 2005 and $5.3 million for 2004. Investment gains
or losses related to our managed funds are included in our consolidated
noninterest


income. Minority interest
in the net gains or losses of these consolidated managed funds primarily
represent net investment gains or losses and management fees expense
attributable to the minority interest holders in these managed funds. The
increase for 2006, compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to $5.6 million
in gains related to exercised equity warrant assets and non-cash change in fair
value, an increase of $1.2 million in client investment fees and an increase of
$0.6 million in letter of credit fees. The increase for 2005, compared to 2004
was primarily attributable to an increase in net securities gains of $1.5
million and an increase in deposit service fees and letter of credit fees of
$0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively.

Noninterest expense was
$20.9 million for 2006, compared to $19.4 million for 2005 and $18.1 million
for 2004. The increase for 2006, compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to
a $1.6 million increase in allocated expenses, which was primarily driven by
expenses related to compensation and benefits as well as increases in
professional services related to management fees at our consolidated managed
funds. The increase for 2005, compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to a
$1.8 million increase in allocated expenses.

Financial Condition

SVB Capital’s average
deposits were $627.0 million in 2006, compared to $641.0 million in 2005 and
$522.4 million in 2004. Average loans were $83.3 million in 2006, compared to
$61.7 million in 2005 and $76.5 million in 2004. The growth in average deposits
in 2005, compared to 2004 was due to various market factors, including an
improved funds flow environment for SVB Capital’s client base, venture capital,
and private equity firms, as well as our initiatives to serve clients at all
stages of growth.

SVB Alliant

(Loss) Before Income Tax Expense

SVB Alliant’s loss before income tax expense for 2006
was $28.8 million, compared to a loss of $0.2 million for 2005 and a $2.8
million loss for 2004. The increase in loss for 2006, compared to 2005 was a
result of lower revenues of $10.0 million and higher noninterest expense of
$18.7 million. The improvement in loss position for 2005, compared to 2004 was
primarily a result of lower noninterest expense of $2.3 million.

Noninterest income was $11.6 million for 2006,
compared to $22.1 million for 2005 and $22.0 million for 2004. The decrease for
2006, compared to 2005 was due to decreased corporate finance fees related to
changes in staffing that occurred in early 2006.

Noninterest expense was
$41.2 million for 2006, compared to $22.6 million for 2005 and $24.9 million
for 2004. The increase for 2006, compared to 2005 was primarily due to a
pre-tax charge of $18.4 million related to an impairment of goodwill incurred
during the second quarter of 2006. The impairment resulted from changes in the
outlook for SVB Alliant’s future financial performance due to changes in early
2006 in staffing and lowered expectations of future revenue streams. The
decrease for 2005, compared to 2004 was primarily a result of lower variable
compensation costs.

Other Business
Services

Net Interest Income

Net interest income was
$40.4 million for 2006, compared to $47.5 million for 2005 and $48.3 million
for 2004. The decrease for 2006, compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to
an increase in other borrowing expense of $20.0 million, which was partially
offset by an increase of loan fees of $8.0 million, higher loan volumes for SVB
Private Client Services and higher loan and deposit volumes from SVB Global
clients.


Consolidated
Financial Condition

Our total assets were $6.0
billion at December 31, 2006, an increase of $502.2 million, or 9.1
percent, compared to $5.5 billion at December 31, 2005, and an increase of
$396.0 million, or 7.7 percent, compared to $5.1 billion at December 31,
2004.

Securities Purchased under Agreement to Resell, and
Other Short-Term Investments

Interest earning deposits, securities purchased under
agreement to resell and other short-term investments totaled
$239.3 million at December 31, 2006, an increase of $63.6 million, or
36.2 percent as compared to $175.7 million outstanding at December 31,
2005. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to higher levels of other
short-term investments of $89.3 million, as a result of cash management
activities in our REIT portfolio, offset by a decrease of $25.3 million in our portfolio
of securities purchased under agreement to resell.


Investment Securities

Investment
securities totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2006, a decrease of $344.9
million, or 16.9 percent from $2.0 billion at December 31, 2005. The

Available-for-Sale

Available-for-sale
investment securities totaled $1.45 billion at December 31, 2006, a
decrease of $405.2 million, or 21.9 percent, from $1.85 billion in 2005, which
decreased $76.0 million, or 3.9 percent, from $1.93 billion in 2004. The
decreases in 2006 and 2005 were due primarily to principal prepayments on
mortgage-backed securities, scheduled maturities of U.S. agency debentures and
a reduction in obligations of state and political subdivisions from scheduled maturities
and calls. Additionally, we sold $119.1 million of selected lower-yielding
investments during the second quarter of 2006. During 2005, we added an
allocation to commercial mortgage-backed securities totaling $69.4 million. The
duration of our fixed income investment portfolio was 2.5 years at December 31,
2006, compared to 2.6 years in 2005 and 2.1 years in 2004.

Non-Marketable
Securities

Non-marketable securities of $246.9 million at December 31,
2006 increased by $60.3 million or 32.3 percent, from $186.6 million in 2005,
which increased by $59.6 million or
46.9 percent, from $127.0 million in 2004.

The increase in non-marketable securities of $60.3
million during 2006 was primarily related to an increase in private equity fund
investments of $45.2 million and a decrease of $5.2 million in other
investments. The increase of $45.2 million in private equity fund investments
is due to additional investments made by our managed funds, SVB Strategic
Investors Fund, LP, SVB Strategic Investors Fund II, LP and SVB Strategic
Investors Fund III, LP. The decrease of $5.2 million in other investments
relates to pay-downs of venture debt securities.

The increase in
non-marketable securities of $59.6 million during 2005 was primarily related to
an increase in private equity fund investments of $28.7 million and an increase
of $22.7 million in other investments. The increase of $28.7 million in private
equity fund investments is due to additional investments made by our managed
funds, SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP and SVB Strategic Investors Fund II,
LP. In 2005, we raised our fourth managed fund, SVB Strategic Investors Fund
III, LP. The increase of $22.7 million in other investments relates to
additional investments in the two debt funds, Partners for Growth, LP and Gold
Hill Venture Lending 03, LP.


Investment
Concentration

At December 31, 2006,
we held no investment securities that were issued by a single party that
exceeded 10.0% of our stockholders’ equity. With the exception of securities
issued by the U.S. Government or by U.S. government sponsored enterprises, we
held no investment securities at December 31, 2005 that were issued by a
single party that exceeded 10.0% of our stockholders’ equity.

Investment Securities—Remaining Contractual Principal
Maturities and Yields (Fully-Taxable Equivalent)

The following table provides the remaining contractual
principal maturities and fully taxable-equivalent yields on investment
securities as of December 31, 2006. Interest income on certain obligations
of states and political subdivisions (non-taxable investments) are presented on
a fully taxable-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 35.0%.
The weighted-average yield is computed using the amortized cost of
available-for-sale securities, which are reported at fair value.

Expected
remaining maturities of callable U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed
securities, and collateralized mortgage obligations may differ significantly
from their contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay
obligations with or without penalties. This risk, known as call risk and
prepayment risk, may result in these securities having longer or shorter
average lives than anticipated at the time of purchase. As interest rates
decline, prepayments generally tend to increase; causing the average expected
remaining maturity to shorten. Conversely, as interest rates rise, prepayments
tend to decrease causing the average expected remaining maturity to extend.
This is most apparent in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations as contractual maturities are typically 15 to 30 years whereas
expected average lives of these securities are significantly shorter and vary
based upon structure. Venture capital fund investments, other private equity investments,
other investments and low income housing tax credit funds are included in the
table below as maturing after 10 years.

Upon maturity, loans satisfying our credit quality
standards may be eligible for renewal. Such renewals are subject to the normal
underwriting and credit administration practices associated with new loans. We
do not grant loans with unconditional extension terms.


A
substantial percentage of our loans are commercial in nature, and such loans
are generally made to emerging-growth or corporate technology companies in a
variety of industries. The breakdown of total loans by industry sector is as

2005.

As of December 31,
2006, our asset-based lending represented 10.3% of total gross loans and
accounts receivable factoring represented 7.1% of total gross loans. Approximately
48.4% and 11.2% of our outstanding gross loan balances as of December 31,
2006 were in the states of California and Massachusetts, respectively. There
are no other states with balances greater than 10%.

Loan Administration

Authority over our loan policies resides with our
Board of Directors. This authority is managed through the approval and periodic
review of our loan policies. The Board of Directors delegates authority to the
Directors’ Loan Committee to supervise our loan underwriting, approval, and
monitoring activities. The Directors’ Loan Committee consists of outside Board
of Director members and our Chief Executive Officer, who serves as an
alternate.

Subject to the oversight
of the Directors’ Loan Committee, lending authority is delegated to the Chief
Credit Officer and our loan committee, which consists of the Chief Credit
Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and other senior members of our lending
management. Requests for new and existing credits that meet certain size and
underwriting criteria may be approved outside of our loan committee by
designated senior lenders or jointly with a Senior Credit Officer or Division
Risk Manager.

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets
consist of loans that are past due 90 days or more that are still accruing
interest, loans on nonaccrual status, other real estate owned (“OREO”), and
other foreclosed assets. The OREO and other foreclosed assets balance was $5.7
million at December 31, 2006, compared to $6.3 million at December 31,
2005. We held no OREO or other foreclosed assets at December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002. The table below sets forth certain data and ratios between
nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets, and the allowance for loan losses.
All nonperforming loans represent impaired loans. We measure all loans placed
on nonaccrual status for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying
collateral or the net present value of the expected cash flows in accordance
with SFAS No. 114.

If the impaired loans for

million, $1.1 million, $1.0 million and $1.3 million in interest income
would have been recognized during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill, which arises from the purchase price
exceeding the assigned value of the net assets of an acquired business,
represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being
acquired. Goodwill at December 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled $21.3 million and
$35.6 million, respectively. Goodwill resulted from the acquisition of SVB
Alliant, our investment banking subsidiary, and eProsper, our equity ownership
data management services company.

In connection with our annual assessment of goodwill
of SVB Alliant during the second quarter of 2006, we concluded that $18.4
million of the related goodwill was impaired and was required to be expensed as
a non-cash charge to continuing operations. Thus, the goodwill balance related to
SVB Alliant was reduced from $35.6 million at December 31, 2005 to $17.2
million at December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, there were no
further indications of impairment beyond that already identified and recorded.

Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and Federal Reserve
Bank (“FRB”) Stock

Our Federal Home Loan Bank
(“FHLB”) and Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) stock are restricted, as we are
required to hold shares of FHLB and FRB stock under the Bank’s borrowing
agreement.


Derivatives

The
gross positive fair values of derivative assets are recorded as a component of
the other assets line item on the balance sheet. The gross negative fair values
of derivative liabilities are recorded as a component of other liabilities line
item on the balance sheet. Derivative assets are recorded as a component of
other assets and liabilities and are comprised of the following as of December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004:

Equity warrant assets increased by $9.9 million in
2006, compared to 2005, due to new equity warrant assets of $9.1 million and non-cash
increase in fair value of $13.0 million. These increases were partially offset
by exercised equity warrant assets of $6.5 million and terminated equity
warrant assets of $5.7 million. Equity warrant assets decreased by $1.1 million
in 2005, compared to 2004, due to new equity warrant assets of $7.4 million and
non-cash increase in fair value of $6.3 million. These increases were partially
offset by exercised equity warrant assets of $11.8 million and terminated
equity warrant assets of $3.0 million.

On October 30, 2003, we entered into an interest
rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $50.0 million. This agreement
hedges against the risk of changes in the fair value associated with the
majority of our 7.0% fixed rate, junior subordinated debentures, which
management evaluates for effectiveness using the statistical regression
analysis approach for each reporting period. For information on our junior
subordinated debentures, see Note 12. Borrowings. The terms of the interest
rate swap agreement provide for a swap of our 7.0% fixed rate payment for a
variable rate based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a
spread. This interest rate swap agreement provided cash benefit of $0.3
million, $1.2 million, and $2.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
swap agreement largely mirrors the terms of the junior subordinated debentures
and therefore is callable by the counterparty anytime on or after October 30,
2008. All components of the swap’s gain or loss are included in the assessment
of hedge effectiveness. Changes in fair value of the fair value hedge
agreement, which is primarily dependent on changes in market interest rates,
are recognized in net income as gains or losses on derivative instruments. We
recorded a non-cash decrease in fair value of $3.3 million for the interest
rate swap agreement prior to its designation as a fair value hedge and $0.3
million for the fair value hedge agreement implemented in April 2006,
which were reflected in gains on derivative instruments, net.

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with
clients involved in international trade finance activities, either as the
purchaser or seller of foreign currency at a future date, depending upon the
clients’ need. We enter into an opposite way foreign exchange forward contract
with a correspondent bank to economically hedge these contracts, which
mitigates the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for each
of the foreign exchange forward contracts entered into with our clients. These
contracts are short term in nature, typically expiring within one year. We also
enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with correspondent banks to
economically hedge foreign exchange risk related to certain foreign currency
denominated loans. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the aggregate
notional amounts of these contracts totaled $562.2 million, $432.7 million
and $525.4 million, respectively. The maximum credit exposure for
counterparty nonperformance for foreign exchange forward contracts with both
clients and correspondent banks at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
amounted to $7.3 million, $5.7 million and


$10.0 million,
respectively. We have not experienced nonperformance by a counterparty and
therefore have not incurred related losses. Further, we anticipate performance
by all counterparties to such foreign exchange forward contracts.

We enter into foreign
currency option contracts with clients involved in international trade finance
activities, either as the purchaser or seller of foreign currency options,
depending upon the clients’ need. We enter into an opposite way foreign
currency option contract with a correspondent bank, which mitigates the risk of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for each of the currency
option contracts entered into with our clients. These contracts typically
expire in less than one year. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
aggregate notional amounts of these contracts totaled $27.6 million,
$18.8 million and $13.5 million, respectively. We have not experienced
nonperformance by a counterparty and therefore have not incurred related
losses. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties. Our maximum
credit risk to nonperformance of counterparties at December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004 was $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $47.0 thousand, respectively.

Convertible Note
Hedge

On May 15, 2003, we
entered into a convertible note hedge agreement (purchased call option) with a
counterparty, with respect to our common stock, to limit our exposure to
potential dilution from conversion of our $150.0 million principal amount of
zero coupon convertible notes. For information on our $150.0 million principal
amount of zero coupon convertible notes, see Borrowings below. At issuance,
under the terms of the convertible note hedge, upon the occurrence of
conversion events, we have the right to purchase up to approximately 4,460,610
shares of our common stock from the counterparty at a price of $33.6277 per
common share. The convertible note hedge agreement will expire on June 15,
2008. We have the option to settle any amounts due under the convertible hedge
either in cash or net shares of our common stock. The cost of the convertible
note hedge is included in stockholders’ equity in accordance with the guidance
in EITF No. 00-19,

Borrowings

Short-term
Borrowings

As of December 31,
2006 and 2005, we had short-term borrowings of $683.5 million and $279.5 million,
respectively. Short-term borrowings include federal funds purchased and
securities sold under agreement to repurchase as well as FHLB advances. Our
short-term borrowings have a remaining maturity of one month or less. We used
short-term borrowings to support our loan growth in 2006 and 2005.

Contingently
Convertible Debt

On May 20, 2003, we
issued $150.0 million of zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes at face
value, due June 15, 2008, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and outside the United States to
non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933. The
notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of $33.6277
per share and are subordinated to all our present and future senior debt.
Holders of the notes may convert their notes only under certain conditions. See
Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12.
Borrowings for further information.

Junior Subordinated
Debentures

On October 30, 2003,
we issued $51.5 million in 7.0% junior subordinated debentures. A portion of
the proceeds were used to complete an early redemption of the existing $40.0
million of 8.25% trust preferred securities. The remainder of the proceeds was
used for general corporate purposes. For further information, see Item 8.
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12.
Borrowings.

Other Long-term
Debt

As of December 31,
2006, we had other long-term debt of $152.7 million. We had no other long-term
debt outstanding as of December 31, 2005. Long-term debt consists of
$150.0 million of FHLB advances and $2.7 million of debt assumed in relation to
the acquisition of a 65% interest in eProsper during the third quarter of 2006.
The FHLB advances were used to support our loan growth in 2006 and mature in
2008 and 2009. The debt assumed in relation to the eProsper acquisition matures
in 2009.


Available Lines of
Credit

As of December 31,
2006, we had available $1.0 billion in uncommitted federal funds lines of
credit, of which $690.0 million were unused. In addition to the available
federal funds lines, the Bank has reverse repurchase agreement lines available
with multiple securities dealers. Repurchase lines allow the Bank to finance
short-term borrowings using various fixed income securities as collateral. At December 31,
2006, the Bank had used $178.0 million of its repurchase lines.

Capital Resources

Our management seeks to
maintain adequate capital to support anticipated asset growth and credit risks,
and to ensure that SVB Financial and the Bank are in compliance with all
regulatory capital guidelines. Our primary sources of new capital include
retained earnings and the issuance of common stock.

Common Stock

As of December 31, 2006, we had repurchased 8.7
million shares totaling $307.2 million. During the year ended December 31,
2006, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock totaling
$103.8 million. At December 31, 2006, $67.8 million of shares may
still be repurchased under our stock repurchase program, which expires on June 30,
2008.

From time to time, we may
implement a non-discretionary trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, where we will automatically
repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a predetermined formula for a
specified period of time.

Stockholders’ Equity

Stockholders’ equity totaled $628.5 million at December 31,
2006, an increase of $59.2 million, or 10.4%, from the $569.3 million balance
at December 31, 2005. This increase was primarily the result of net
income, as well as share-based compensation expense recognized upon the
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), and issuance of stock options, partially
offset by common stock repurchases. We have not paid a cash dividend on our
common stock since 1992 and as of December 31, 2006, there are no plans
for payment of dividends. Additionally, we do not have any material commitments
for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2006.

Funds generated through
retained earnings are a significant source of capital and liquidity and are
expected to continue to be so in the future. Our management engages in a
periodic capital planning process in an effort to make effective use of the
capital available to us. The capital plan considers capital needs for the
foreseeable future and allocates capital to both existing and future business activities.
Expected future activities for which capital is set aside include potential
product expansions and acquisitions of new business lines.

Credit Rating

SVB Financial currently holds a BBB long-term
counterparty credit rating from Standard & Poor’s Rating Service (“S&P”).
This rating was confirmed in December 2006 and was recently upgraded from
BBB

-

in February 2006. The Bank holds a BBB+ long-term counterparty credit
rating from S&P, also confirmed in December 2006 and similarly
upgraded from BBB in February 2006. The outlook for both SVB Financial and
the Bank is stable. An issuer rated BBB is defined as having adequate capacity
to meet its financial commitments, however, adverse economic conditions or
changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the
obligor to meet its financial commitments.


Additionally, SVB
Financial currently holds a Baa1 issuer rating from Moody’s Investor Service (“Moody’s”),
which was confirmed in November 2006. The Bank holds an A3 issuer rating
from Moody’s, also confirmed in November 2006. The outlook for both SVB
Financial and the Bank is stable. In addition to issuer ratings, Moody’s has
assigned the Bank a long term deposit rating of A3, a short-term deposit rating
of P-2, and a C for financial strength. An issuer rated Baa by Moody’s
offers adequate financial security, however, certain protective elements may be
lacking or may be unreliable over any great period of time. Moody’s bank
deposit ratings are opinions of the bank’s ability to repay punctually its
foreign and domestic currency deposit obligations. An A rating for deposits
represents good credit quality, however, elements may be present that suggest a
susceptibility to impairment over the long-term. Banks rated P-2 for short-term
deposits offer strong credit quality and a strong capacity for timely payment
of short-term deposit obligations. Financial strength ratings represent Moody’s
opinion of a bank’s intrinsic safety and soundness and, as such, exclude
certain external credit risks and credit support elements that are addressed by
Moody’s bank deposit ratings. Banks rated C possess adequate intrinsic
financial strength and are typically institutions with more limited, but still
valuable, business franchises, good financial fundamentals, and a predictable
and stable operating environment.

Liquidity

An important objective of the asset/liability
management is to manage liquidity. The objective of liquidity management is to
ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet loan demand, to meet
depositors’ needs, and to service other liabilities as they become due without
causing an undue amount of cost or risk and without causing a disruption to
normal operating conditions.

We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of
projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical
deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and
economic conditions, individual client funding needs, and existing and planned
business activities. Our asset/liability committee provides oversight to the
liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines, subject to our
Board of Directors’ approval, and courses of action to address our actual and
projected liquidity needs.

Historically, we have attracted a stable, low-cost
deposit base, which has been our primary source of liquidity. We continue to
expand on opportunities to increase our liquidity and take steps to carefully
manage our liquidity. We have increased our use of other sources of liquidity
available to us, including federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, repurchase
agreements, and other short-term borrowing arrangements. Our liquidity
requirements can also be met through the use of our portfolio of liquid assets.
Our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash equivalents in excess of
the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations,
securities purchased under resale agreements, investment securities maturing
within six months, investment securities eligible and available for financing
or pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of six months, and anticipated
near-term cash flows from investments.

Our policy guidelines provide that liquid assets as a
percentage of total deposits should not fall below 20.0%. Our ratio of liquid
assets to total deposits was 34.1% and 39.6% at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively, both well in excess of our minimum policy guidelines. In
addition to monitoring the level of liquid assets relative to total deposits, we
also utilize other policy measures in liquidity management activities such as
the percentage of liquid assets to volatile liabilities and our loan-to-deposit
ratio.

On a stand-alone basis,
SVB Financial’s primary liquidity channels include dividends from the Bank, its
investment portfolio assets, and its ability to raise debt and capital. The
ability of the Bank to pay dividends is subject to certain regulations
described in “Part I. Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Restriction
on Dividends.”

In analyzing our liquidity
for 2006, 2005 and 2004, reference is made to our consolidated statements of
cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004; see Item
8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. The statement of
cash flows includes separate categories for operating, investing, and financing
activities.


Cash provided by operating activities was $127.6
million for 2006, which included net income of $89.4 million. Significant
adjustments for noncash items included $18.4 million related to impairment of
goodwill, $9.9 related to provision for loan losses, $21.3 million of
stock-based compensation and $9.6 million of depreciation and amortization
offset by amortization of deferred warrant related loan fees of $7.1 million
and changes in the fair value of derivatives of $10.5 million.

Cash used for investing activities was $299.6 million
for 2006. Net cash outflow was primarily driven by a net increase in loans of $646.0
million, purchases of premises and equipment of $20.7 million and purchases of
investment securities of $129.2 million, offset by $119.2 million in proceeds
from the sale of investment securities and $370.9 million in proceeds from
maturities and pay-downs of investment securities.

Cash provided by financing activities was $342.5
million for 2006. Increases in short-term borrowings of $404.1 million and a
$150.0 million increase from proceeds from issuance of other long-term debt
provided the primary sources of financing, which were offset by declines in
deposits of $195.1 million and common stock repurchases of $103.8 million.

Cash and cash equivalents
at December 31, 2006 were $632.6 million.


Cash provided by operating activities for 2005 was
$113.6 million, which included net income of $92.5 million. Significant
adjustments for noncash items included $9.8 million in tax benefits related to
stock compensation, $7.9 million of stock-based compensation and $7.8 million
of depreciation and amortization offset by amortization of deferred warrant
related loan fees of $6.1 million, net investment gains of $4.3 million and
changes in fair value of derivatives of $3.3 million.


Cash used for investing activities was $567.9 million
for 2005. Net cash outflow was primarily driven by a net increase in loans of
$549.4 million and purchases of premises and equipment of $18.3 million. In
addition, purchases of investment securities of $534.3 million, offset by $27.3
million in proceeds from the sale of investment securities and $495.4 million
in proceeds from maturities and pay-downs of investment securities also contributed
to the net cash outflow.

Cash provided by financing activities was $289.2
million for 2005, largely driven by net increases in other borrowings of $269.7
million and capital contributions from minority interest participants net of
distributions of $45.4 million. Deposits and proceeds from the issuance of
common stock due to exercises of employee stock options also contributed $33.2
million and $18.6 million, respectively. These sources of cash were offset by
repurchases of our common stock of $77.7 million during 2005.

Cash and cash equivalents
were $462.1 million at December 31, 2005.


Cash provided by operating activities for 2004 was
$94.3 million, which included net income of $63.9 million. Significant
adjustments for noncash items included $9.9 million in tax benefits related to
stock compensation, depreciation and amortization of $8.8 million, and deferred
income tax expense of $5.6 million, offset by a net recovery of loan
losses of $10.3 million, amortization of deferred warrant related loan fees of
$5.7 million and net investment gains of $5.2 million. Sources of cash from
changes in other assets and liabilities included increases in accrued
retention, incentive plans and other compensation benefits payable of $17.3
million and a decrease in income tax receivable of $4.6 million. These sources
of cash were offset by a $7.3 million increase in accounts receivable and an
increase in accrued interest receivable of $3.4 million.

Cash used for investing activities was $876.3 million
for 2004. Net cash outflow was primarily driven by purchases of investment
securities of $1.4 billion, partially offset by $162.0 million in proceeds
from the sale of investment securities and $729.2 million in proceeds from
maturities and pay-downs of investment securities. A net increase in loans of
$341.7 million also contributed to the net cash outflow.

Cash provided by financing activities was $573.9
million for 2004, largely driven by net increases in deposits of $552.7
million. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock due to exercises of
employee stock options and capital contributions from minority interest
participants net of distributions also contributed $25.1 million and $16.9
million, respectively. These sources of cash were offset by repurchases of our
common stock of $12.6 million during 2004 and a decrease in other borrowings of
$8.1 million.

Cash and cash equivalents
were $627.2 million at December 31, 2004.

Capital Ratios

Both SVB Financial
and the Bank are subject to capital adequacy guidelines issued by the Federal
Reserve Board. Under these capital guidelines, the minimum total risk-based
capital ratio and Tier 1 risk-


based capital ratio requirements are 10.0% and 6.0%,
respectively, for a well-capitalized depository institution.

The Federal Reserve
Board has also established minimum capital leverage ratio guidelines for state
member banks. The ratio is determined using Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly
average total assets. The guidelines require a minimum of 5.0% for a
well-capitalized depository institution. For further information on risk-based
capital and leverage ratios as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, see “Part I.
Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Regulatory Capital.”

Both
the capital ratios of SVB Financial and the Bank were in excess of regulatory
guidelines for a well-capitalized depository institution as of December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004. See “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 21. Regulatory Matters”. Capital ratios for SVB
Financial are set forth below:

The decrease in total
risk-based capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital in 2006 and 2005 was due to
the declining eligibility of our convertible bond as it approaches maturity,
repurchases of our common stock and growth in risk weighted assets, particularly
loans. The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased due to the earnings generated by the
consolidated companies offset slightly by share repurchases executed over the
course of the year.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

In the normal course of
business, we use financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the
financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include
commitments to extend credit and commercial and standby letters of credit.
These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. Credit
risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties
to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the
contract.

Commitments to Extend Credit

A commitment to extend
credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no
violation of any condition established in the agreement. Such commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates, or other termination clauses, and
usually require a fee paid by the client upon us issuing the commitment.
Commitments which are available for funding, due to clients meeting all
collateral, compliance, and financial covenants required under loan commitment
agreements, totaled $4.1 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively. Out of these available commitment balances, the fixed-rate
commitments were $611.7 million and $325.5 million at December 31, 2006
and 2005, respectively. Commitments which are unavailable for funding, due to
clients not meeting all collateral, compliance, and financial covenants
required under loan commitment agreements, totaled $0.6 billion and $0.9
billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our potential
exposure to credit loss, in the event of nonperformance by the other party to
the financial instrument, is the contractual amount of the available unused
loan commitment. We use the same credit approval and monitoring process in
extending loan commitments as we do in making loans. The actual liquidity needs
or the credit risk that we have experienced have historically been lower than
the contractual amount of commitments to extend credit because a significant
portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. We evaluate each
potential borrower and the necessary collateral on an individual basis. The
type of collateral varies, but


may
include real property, intellectual property, bank deposits, or business and
personal assets. The potential credit risk associated with these commitments is
considered in management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the liability for
unfunded credit commitments. Additionally, we had aggregate maximum lending
limits of $468.1 million and $472.7 million as of December 31, 2006
and 2005, respectively, related to our accounts receivable factoring
arrangements. We extend credit under accounts receivable factoring arrangements
when our clients’ sales invoices are deemed credit worthy under existing
underwriting practices.

Commercial and Standby Letters of Credits

Commercial and standby letters of credit represent
conditional commitments issued by us on behalf of a client to support the
performance of a client to a third party when certain specified future events
have yet to occur. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily for
inventory purchases by a client and are typically short-term in nature. We
provide two types of standby letters of credit, performance and financial
standby letters of credit. Performance standby letters of credit are issued in
connection with the performance of a client to a third party when certain
specified future events have yet to occur and are primarily used to support
performance instruments such as bid bonds, performance bonds, lease
obligations, repayment of loans, and past due notices. Financial standby
letters of credit are conditional undertakings issued by us in connection with
the payment by a client to a third party (beneficiary) and are primarily used
to support many types of domestic and international payments. These standby
letters of credit have fixed expiration dates and generally require a fee to be
paid by the client at the time we issue the commitment. Fees generated from
these standby letters of credit are recognized in noninterest income over the commitment
period.

The credit risk
involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved
with extending loan commitments to clients, and accordingly, we use a credit
evaluation process and collateral requirements similar to those for loan
commitments. Our standby letters of credit often are cash secured by our
clients. The actual liquidity needs or the credit risk that we have experienced
historically have been lower than the contractual amount of letters of credit
issued because a significant portion of these conditional commitments expire
without being drawn upon.

The table below summarizes
our commercial and standby letters of credit at December 31, 2006. The
maximum potential amount of future payments represents the amount that could be
lost under letters of credit if there were a total default by the guaranteed
parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions
or from the collateral held or pledged.

At December 31, 2006
and 2005, deferred fees related to financial and performance standby letters of
credit were $3.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively. At December 31,
2006, collateral in the form of cash and investment securities available to us
to reimburse losses, if any, under financial and performance standby letters of
credits was $267.4 million.


Credit Card Guarantees

The Bank, as a financial
provider, routinely guarantees credit cards for some of our customers which
have been provided by an unaffiliated financial institution. The Bank has
recourse against the customer for any amount it is required to pay to a third
party in the event of default under these arrangements. These guarantees are
subject to the same credit policies, underwriting standards and approval
process as loans made by the Bank. Certain of these amounts are secured by
certificates of deposit and other assets which the Bank has rights to in the
event of nonperformance by the customers. The total amount of this guarantee
was $72.6 million at December 31, 2006. The fair value of the liability
associated with this guarantee is not significant. Credit card fees totaled
$4.6 million, $3.7 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Commitments to Invest in Private Equity Fund
Investments

We
make commitments to invest in private equity funds, which in turn make investments
in privately held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally
made up to a ten-year period from the inception of the fund. The timing of
future cash requirements to fund such commitments is generally dependent upon
the investment cycle, the overall market conditions, and the nature and type of
industry in which the privately held companies operate. The following table
details our total capital commitments and our unfunded commitments at December 31,
2006.

See
Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7.
Investment Securities, for further disclosure related to investment securities.
We make investment commitments to invest in funds. Commitments to invest in
these funds are generally made up to a ten-year period from the inception of
the fund. The timing of future cash requirements to fund such commitments is
generally dependent upon the investment cycle, overall market conditions, and
the nature and type of industry in which the privately held companies operate.

k

Interest Rate Risk Management

A key objective of asset/liability management is to
manage interest rate risk associated with changing asset and liability cash
flows and market interest rate movements. Interest rate risk occurs when
interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities do not re-price simultaneously
both in timing and volume. Our asset/liability committee provides oversight to
our interest rate risk management process and recommends policy guidelines
regarding exposure to interest rates for approval by our Board of Directors.
Adherence to these policies is monitored on an ongoing basis, and decisions related
to the management of interest rate exposure are made when appropriate.

We manage interest rate risk principally through
strategies involving our investment securities and funding portfolios. Our
policies also permit the use of off-balance sheet derivative instruments in
managing interest rate risk.

We had a fair value
hedge in effect at December 31, 2006. This hedge is a $50.0 million
fixed-for-variable swap of our 7% junior subordinated debentures, described in
Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12.
Borrowings and under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition—Junior Subordinated
Debentures. During 2006, we paid interest expense of $3.4 million on the 7.0%
junior subordinated debentures. However, the fair value hedge agreement
provided a cash benefit of $0.3 million, resulting in net interest expense of
$3.1 million for 2006.

Our monitoring activities related to managing interest
rate risk include both interest rate sensitivity gap analysis and the use of a
simulation model. While traditional gap analysis provides a simple picture of
the interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet, it provides only a static
view of interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time and does not
measure the potential volatility in forecasted results relating to changes in
market interest rates over time. Accordingly, we combine the use of gap
analysis with use of a simulation model that provides a dynamic assessment of
interest rate sensitivity.

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis

The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the
difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-sensitive
liabilities that are anticipated to re-price within a specific time period. A
gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets
exceeds the amount of interest-sensitive liabilities re-pricing within that
same time period. Positive cumulative gaps in early time periods suggest that
earnings will increase when interest rates rise. Negative cumulative gaps
suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates fall. The gap analysis
as of December 31, 2006 indicates that the cumulative one-year gap as a
percentage of interest-earning assets was a positive 36.4%.


The
following table illustrates our interest rate sensitivity gap positions at December 31,
2006:

One application of the aforementioned simulation model
involves measurement of the impact of market interest rate changes on the net
present value of estimated cash flows from our assets, liabilities, and

Another application measures the impact of market interest rate changes on our
net interest income (“NII”).


The
following table presents our MVPE and NII exposure at December 31, 2006
and 2005, related to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in

The preceding table indicates that at December 31,
2006, in the event of an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in
market interest rates, our MVPE would be expected to increase or decrease
accordingly.

The market value calculations supporting the results
in the preceding table are based on the present value of estimated cash flows
using both market interest rates provided by independent broker/dealers and
other publicly available sources that we deem reliable. These estimates are
highly assumption dependent and will change regularly as our asset-liability
structure changes and as different interest rate environments evolve. These
calculations do not contemplate any changes that we could make to reduce our
MVPE exposure in response to a change in market interest rates. We expect to
continue to manage our interest rate risk actively utilizing on and off-balance
sheet strategies as appropriate.

As with any method of measuring interest rate risk,
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the
preceding table. For example, although certain of our assets and liabilities
may have similar maturity or re-pricing profiles, they may react to changes in
market interest rates with different magnitudes. Also, actual prepayment rates
on loans and investments could vary substantially from the assumptions utilized
in the model to derive the results as presented in the preceding table.
Further, a change in the shape of the forward yield curve could result in
different MVPE and NII estimations from those presented herein. Accordingly,
the results in the preceding table should not be relied upon as indicative of
actual results in the event of changing market interest rates. Additionally,
the resulting MVPE and NII estimates are not intended to represent, and should
not be construed to represent the underlying value.

Our MVPE and NII sensitivity at December 31,
2006, decreased from December 31, 2005, primarily due to increases in
short-term borrowings and higher levels of current interest rates in the up
rate scenarios. Our MVPE sensitivity increased in the down rate scenarios and
our NII sensitivity decreased due to changes in the balance sheet structure of
our deposit and funding portfolios.

Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk
impacting us. Other types of market risk affecting us in the normal course of
our business activities include foreign currency exchange risk, equity price
risk, and basis risk. The impact resulting from these market risks is not
considered significant, and no separate quantitative information concerning
market rate and price exposure is presented herein.


Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

SVB Financial Group:

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A(b)), that SVB Financial Group
and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).


We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006 and our report
dated March 1, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on these
consolidated financial statements.

SVB Financial Group:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of SVB Financial Group and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2006. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over

SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   Nature of
Business

Nature of Business

SVB Financial Group and its subsidiaries and divisions
(which we refer to collectively as “we”, “our” or “us” in this Form 10-K)
offer a diversity of banking and financial products and services to support our
clients throughout their life cycles, regardless of their size or stage of
maturity. SVB Financial Group, our parent company (which we refer to as “SVB
Financial” or the “Parent”) is a bank holding company and financial holding
company, incorporated in the state of Delaware in March 1999. We are
headquartered in Santa Clara, California.

We offer commercial banking products and services
through our principal subsidiary, Silicon Valley Bank (the “Bank”), which is a
California state-chartered bank founded in 1983 and a member of the Federal
Reserve System. Through its subsidiaries, the Bank also offers brokerage,
investment advisory and asset management services. We also offer non-banking
products and services, such as investment banking, funds management, private equity
investment and equity valuation, through our other subsidiaries and divisions. We
primarily focus on serving our clients in the following niches:  technology, life sciences, private equity and
premium wine.

For reporting purposes,
SVB Financial Group has four operating segments in which we report our
financial information: Commercial Banking, SVB Capital, SVB Alliant and Other
Business Services. Our Commercial Banking segment includes our commercial
banking services through the Bank and its subsidiaries, where we offer lending,
deposit, cash management, global trade, brokerage and investment advisory
products and services. Our SVB Capital segment consists of our private equity
division, which focuses on providing banking products and services to private
equity firms and funds management. Our SVB Alliant segment is comprised of our
investment banking subsidiaries, which provides advisory services in the areas
of mergers and acquisitions, corporate finance, strategic alliances and private
placements. Lastly, all other businesses, such as SVB Private Client Services
(private banking), SVB Global (global expansion) and SVB Analytics (equity
valuation and management), are included in the Other Business Services segment.

2.   Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Estimates may change as new information is obtained. Material
estimates that are particularly susceptible to possible change in the near term
relate to the valuation of non-marketable securities, the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses, valuation of equity warrant assets, valuation of
goodwill and the adequacy of the allowance for unfunded commitments.

Principles of Consolidation and Presentation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of SVB Financial Group and our majority-owned subsidiaries and variable
interest entities (“VIEs”) for which we are the primary beneficiary. All


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. If we own at least 20%, but less
than 50% voting interest and have the ability to exert significant influence
over the financial operations and policies of an affiliate corporation, we
account for the investment using the equity method. If we own less than 20%
voting interest of a company and do not extend significant influence over the
financial operations and policies of the company, we carry the investment at
cost less other than a temporary impairment, except marketable equity
securities classified as available-for-sale securities, which we carry at fair
value with changes in fair value included in other comprehensive income, net of
applicable taxes. If we own more than 5%, but less than 50%, in a limited
partnership, we account for the investment using the equity method. If we own less
than 5% in a limited partnership, we carry the investment at cost less other
than a temporary impairment. Assets accounted for under the equity and cost
method are included in investment securities.

We are variable interest holders in certain partnership
for which we are the primary beneficiary as defined by Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46 (revised 2003),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

(“FIN 46R”). The following provides a summary of the VIEs in which we have a
significant variable interest, and discusses the accounting changes that
resulted from the adoption of FIN 46R.

We have a significant variable limited partnership
interest in the Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners 03, LLC (“GHLLC”),
which is the general partner of Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP, a venture
debt fund, and certain affiliated funds (the “Gold Hill Funds”). GHLLC was
formed in 2000 and was consolidated as a wholly-owned subsidiary until it
admitted additional members in the third quarter of 2004, which caused GHLLC to
meet the FIN 46R definition of a VIE, since we have disproportionately few
voting rights and substantially all of GHLLC’s activities involve or are
conducted on our behalf. Because we are the primary beneficiary of the entity,
we continued to consolidate GHLLC, subsequent to the admission of additional
members, as a VIE under FIN 46R which requires that the elimination of
intercompany balances and transactions be attributed to the primary beneficiary
(and not to noncontrolling interests) in the consolidated financial statements.
Creditors of the entity do not have recourse against us, and our exposure to
loss as a result of involvement with GHLLC at December 31, 2006 was
limited to approximately $13.8 million of net equity investment in the entity
and approximately $5.2 million of commitments for future investments. None of
the Gold Hill Funds meets the FIN 46R definition of a VIE.

SVB Financial owns 100% of
the common stock of SVB Capital II, an entity formed in October 2003 to
issue trust preferred securities. SVB Financial has provided a full and
unconditional guarantee of the trust preferred securities and SVB Capital II
has no operating history or independent operations and is not engaged in and
does not propose to engage in any other activity. SVB Capital II meets the FIN
46R definition of a VIE, but we are not the primary beneficiary in this entity
because, as a result of our investment being funded by SVB Capital II, the
investment is not considered to be at risk. As such, SVB Capital II was not
consolidated into our financial statements at December 31, 2006, or December 31,
2005. The junior subordinated debentures held by SVB Financial ($51.4 million
at December 31, 2006) are included in our borrowings. See Note 12.
Borrowings. We are not exposed to loss related to SVB Capital II. The
Federal Reserve Board announced in July 2003 that qualifying trust
preferred securities will continue to be treated as Tier 1 capital until notice
is given to the contrary.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand,
cash balances due from banks, interest-earning deposits, securities purchased
under agreement to resell and other short-term investment securities. For
purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, we consider cash
equivalents to be highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to
known amounts of cash with original maturity or purchased maturity dates
generally of 90 days or less.

Reverse repurchase
agreements are collateralized by government and government agency securities,
mortgage-backed securities rated single A or better, and A1 rated commercial
paper. Company policy allows segregated customer safekeeping of assets due to
the overnight tenor of the aforementioned transactions and we regularly monitor
the suitability and market value of collateral underlying the transactions.

Investment Securities

Fixed Income
Securities

Fixed income investment securities are classified as
held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, trading, or non-marketable upon purchase
or acquisition.

Securities purchased with the ability and positive
intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and
are accounted for at historical cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums
or the accretion of discounts to maturity, where appropriate. Unrealized losses
on held-to-maturity securities become realized and are charged against earnings
when it is determined that an other-than-temporary decline in value has
occurred. We did not have any investments in the held-to-maturity portfolio at December 31,
2006 or 2005.

Securities not classified as trading or held to
maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are accounted for at fair
value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net
of applicable taxes, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income,
which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity, until realized.

Securities acquired and held principally for the
purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading and are accounted
for at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from fair value
adjustments on trading securities, as well as gains and losses realized upon
the sale of investment securities, are included in noninterest income. We did
not have a fixed income trading portfolio at December 31, 2006 or 2005.

We consider a
number of factors in determining other-than-temporary impairment. An indicator
of impairment for both marketable equity and debt securities is a
non-recoverable decline in market price below the amount recorded for that
investment. We also consider the following factors:

·

The
length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost;

·

The
reasons for the decline in market price, whether industry-wide or
issuer-specific;

·

Changes
in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the issuer’s
industry;

·

Changes
in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the issuer’s
industry;


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

·

The
issuer’s financial condition, capital strength and near-term prospects, as well
as its ability to make timely future payments;

·

Any
changes in credit ratings and any potential actions; and

·

Our
investment horizon.

Market valuations represent the current fair value of
a security at a specified point in time and do not represent the risk of
repayment of the principal due to our ability to hold the security to maturity.
Gains and losses on securities are only realized upon the sale of the security
prior to maturity. Whereas a credit downgrade represents an increased level of
risk of other-than-temporary impairment it will only be recognized
if we assess the downgrade to challenge the issuer’s ability to service the
debt and to repay the principal at contractual maturity.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 91,

Accounting for
Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and
Initial Direct Costs of Leases

(“SFAS No. 91”), we use actual
principal prepayment experience to calculate the constant effective yield
necessary to apply the interest method in the amortization of purchase
discounts or premiums on mortgage-backed securities. Estimates of future
principal prepayments, provided by third-party market-data vendors, are used in
addition to actual principal prepayment experience to calculate the constant
effective yield necessary to apply the interest method in the amortization of
purchase discounts or premiums on collateralized mortgage obligations.

Amortization of premiums
and accretion of discounts on all other debt securities are included in
interest income over the contractual terms of the underlying investment
securities using the straight-line method, which does not vary materially from
the effective interest method.

Non-Marketable
Securities

Our accounting for
investments in non-marketable securities depends on several factors, including
the level of ownership/control and the legal structure of its subsidiary making
the investment. As further described below, we base our accounting for such
securities on: (i) investment company fair value accounting, (ii) equity
method accounting, or (iii) cost method accounting.

Investment Company Fair Value

Our non-marketable
securities recorded pursuant to investment company fair value accounting
consist of our investments in the following funds:

·

Direct
equity venture funds, Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP and SVB Capital Partners
II, LP, which make equity investments in privately held companies;

·

Funds
of funds, SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP, SVB Strategic Investors Fund II,
LP, and SVB Strategic Investors Fund III, LP, which make investments in private
equity funds; and

·

Special
situation debt fund, Partners for Growth, LP, which provides financing to
companies in the form of structured loans and equity investments.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

estimated fair value of
the investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in our consolidated
net income.

Under investment company
accounting, investments are carried at estimated fair value based on financial
information obtained as the general partner of the fund or obtained from the
funds’ respective general partner. For our fund investments, we utilize the
most recent available financial information available from the investee general
partner, usually September 30, for our December 31 consolidated
financial statements, adjusted for any contributions paid or distributions
received from the investment during the fourth quarter. The valuations
generally remain at cost until such time that there is significant evidence of
a change in value based upon consideration of the relevant market conditions,
offering prices, operating results, financial conditions, exit strategies, and
other pertinent information. Thus, any gains or losses resulting from changes
in the estimated fair value of the investments are recorded as investment gains
or losses in our consolidated net income. The portion of any investment gains
or losses attributable to the limited partners is reflected as minority
interest in net income (loss) of consolidated affiliates and adjusts SVB
Financial’s investment returns to reflect its percentage ownership.

Equity Method

Our equity method non-marketable securities consist of
an investment in a venture debt fund and several qualified affordable housing
tax credit funds.

The venture debt fund investment is in Gold Hill
Venture Lending 03, LP, which provides financing to privately-held companies in
the form of loans and equity investments. SVB Financial has direct and indirect
interests totaling 9.3% in Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP. Our total interest
in Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP exceeds the 3% to 5% ownership interest
threshold established by Emerging Issue Task Force (“EITF”) Topic D-46,

Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments

(“EITF Topic
D-46”) for cost method accounting. Accordingly, this limited partnership
investment is accounted for under the equity method. We recognize our
proportionate share of the results of operations of this equity method investee
in its results of operations, based on the most current financial information
available from the investee.

We invest in several qualified affordable housing
projects, which provide us benefits in the form of tax credits. Under EITF 94-1,

Accounting for Tax Benefits Resulting From
Investments in Affordable Housing Projects

, we account for such
investments under the equity method in accordance with the provisions of the
AICPA Statement of Position (“SOP”) 78-9,

Accounting
for Investments in Real Estate Ventures

.

We review these
investments at least quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment.
Our review typically includes an analysis of facts and circumstances for each
investment, the expectations of the investment’s future cash flows and capital
needs, variability of its business and the company’s exit strategy. We reduce
our investment value when we consider declines in value to be other than
temporary. We recognize the estimated loss as a loss on investment securities,
a component of noninterest income.

Cost Method

Our cost method
non-marketable securities and related accounting policies are described as
follows:

·

In
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18,

The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock

, equity securities, such as preferred or common stock
in privately-held companies in which we hold an ownership interest of less than
20%


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

and in which we do not
have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investees’
operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the cost method.

·

In
accordance with the provisions of EITF Topic D-46, investments in limited
partnerships in which we hold an ownership interest of less than 5% and in
which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the
investees’ operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the cost
method. These non-marketable
securities include investments in private equity funds.

As stated above, we record these investments at cost
and recognize as income, distributions or returns received from net accumulated
earnings of the investee since the date of acquisition. Our share of net
accumulated earnings of the investee after the date of investment are
recognized in consolidated net income only to the extent distributed by the investee.
Distributions or returns received in excess of accumulated earnings are
considered a return of investment and are recorded as reductions in the cost
basis of the investment.

We review these assets at least quarterly for possible
other than temporary impairment. Our review typically includes an analysis of
facts and circumstances of each investment, the expectations of the investment’s
future cash flows and capital needs, variability of its business and the
company’s exit strategy. We reduce the investment value when we consider
declines in value to be other than temporary. We recognize the estimated loss
as a loss on investment securities, a component of noninterest income.

Gains or losses on cost
method investment securities that result from a portfolio company being
acquired by a publicly traded company are marked to market when the acquisition
occurs. The resulting gains or losses are recognized into consolidated net
income on that date in accordance with EITF No. 91-5,

Nonmonetary Exchange of Cost-Method Investments

.
Further fluctuations in the market value of these equity securities, which are
classified as available-for-sale securities, are excluded from consolidated net
income and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable
taxes, a component of stockholders’ equity. Upon the sale of these equity
securities to a third party, gains and losses, which are measured from the
acquisition value, are recognized in our consolidated net income.

Loans

Loans are reported at the
principal amount outstanding, net of unearned loan fees. Unearned loan fees
reflect residual unamortized deferred loan origination and commitment fees net
of residual unamortized deferred loan origination costs. In addition to cash
loan fees, we often obtain equity warrant assets to purchase a position in a
client company’s stock in consideration for providing credit facilities. The
grant date fair values of these equity warrant assets are deemed to be loan
fees and are required to be deferred as unearned income and recognized as an
adjustment of loan yield through loan interest income as prescribed by SFAS No. 91.
The net amount of unearned loan fees is amortized into loan interest income
over the contractual terms of the underlying loans and commitments using the
constant effective yield method, adjusted for actual loan prepayment
experience, or the straight-line method, as applicable.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is established through a
provision for loan losses charged to expense to provide for credit risk. Our
allowance for loan losses is established for estimated loan losses that are
probable but not yet realized. The process of estimating loan losses is
imprecise. We apply the following evaluation process to our loan portfolio to
estimate the required allowance for loan losses:


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

We maintain a systematic process for the evaluation of
individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses. On a
quarterly basis, each loan in our portfolio is assigned a credit risk rating
and client niche. Credit risk-ratings are assigned on a scale of 1 to 10, with
1 representing loans with a low risk of nonpayment, 9 representing loans with
the highest risk of nonpayment, and 10 representing loans which have been
charged-off. This credit risk-rating evaluation process includes, but is not
limited to, consideration of such factors as payment status, the financial
condition of the borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying
collateral values, potential loan concentrations, and general economic
conditions. Our policies require a committee of senior management to review, at
least quarterly, credit relationships that exceed specific dollar values. Our
review process evaluates the appropriateness of the credit risk rating and
allocation of the allowance for loan losses, as well as other account
management functions. The allowance for loan losses is allocated based on a
formula allocation for similarly risk-rated loans and client niches and
includes an allowance for individual loans deemed to be impaired under the
provisions of SFAS No. 114,

Accounting
by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan

(“SFAS No. 114”).

Our evaluation process is
designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. We assess
the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio by utilizing modeling
techniques. For this purpose we have developed a statistical model based on
historical loan loss migration to estimate an appropriate allowance for
outstanding loan balances. In addition, we apply a macro allocation to the
results of the aforementioned model to ascertain the total allowance for loan
losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective
information, the classification of loans and the establishment of the allowance
for loan losses rely, to a great extent, on the judgment and experience of our
management.

Uncollectible Loans and Write-offs

Loans are considered for
full or partial charge-offs in the event that principal or interest is over 180
days past due, the loan lacks sufficient collateral and it is not in the
process of collection. We also consider writing off loans in the event of any
of the following circumstances: 1) the impaired loan balances are not covered
by the value of the source of repayment; 2) the loan has been identified for
charge-off by regulatory authorities; and 3) any overdrafts greater than 90
days.

Other Real Estate Owned

Loans secured by real
estate are transferred to Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) at the time of
foreclosure. OREO is carried on our balance sheet at the lower of the recorded
investment in the loan or the fair value of the property foreclosed upon less
estimated costs of disposal. Upon transfer of a loan to OREO, an appraisal is
obtained and any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the property
less estimated costs of disposal is charged against the allowance for loan
losses. Revenues and expenses associated with OREO, and subsequent adjustments
to the fair value of the property and to the estimated costs of disposal, are
realized and reported as a component of noninterest expense when incurred. OREO
of $5.7 million and $6.3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, is included in other assets.

Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments

We record a liability for
probable and estimable losses associated with our unfunded loan commitment
being funded and subsequently being charged off. Each quarter, every unfunded
client credit commitment is allocated to a credit risk-rating category in
accordance with each client’s credit risk rating. We use the historical loan
loss factors described under our Allowance for Loan Losses, to calculate the
possible loan loss experience if unfunded credit commitments are funded.
Separately, we use historical


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

trends
to calculate a probability of an unfunded credit commitment being funded. We
apply the loan funding probability factor to risk-factor adjusted unfunded
commitments by credit risk-rating to derive the allowance for unfunded loan
commitments. The allowance for unfunded credit commitments may also include
certain macro allocations as deemed appropriate by our management. We reflect
the allowance for unfunded credit commitments in other liabilities.

Nonaccrual Loans

SFAS No. 114 and SFAS No. 118,

Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan Income Recognition and
Disclosures

, require us to measure the impairment of a loan based
upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s
effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, we may measure
impairment based on the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. A loan is considered impaired
when, based upon currently known information, it is deemed probable that we
will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of
the agreement.

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become
90 days past due as to principal or interest payments (unless the principal and
interest are well secured and in the process of collection); or when we have
determined, based upon currently known information, that the timely collection
of principal or interest is doubtful; or when the loans otherwise become
impaired under the provisions of SFAS No. 114.

When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the
accrued interest is reversed against interest income and the loan is accounted
for on the cash or cost recovery method thereafter until qualifying for return
to accrual status. Generally, a loan will be returned to accrual status when
all delinquent principal and interest become current in accordance with the
terms of the loan agreement and full collection of the principal and interest
appears probable.

If it is determined that
the value of an impaired loan is less than recorded investment in the loan net
of previous charge-offs and payments collected, we recognize impairment through
an allowance for loan losses as determined by a SFAS No. 114 analysis.

Standby Letters of Credit

In accordance with the
provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

(“FIN 45”), we recognize a
liability at the inception of a standby letter of credit equivalent to the
premium of the fee received for such guarantee. The liability recognized at the
inception of the guarantee is equivalent to the premium or fee received or
receivable. Among the types of guarantee contracts to which the provisions of
FIN 45 apply are financial standby letters of credit and performance standby
letters of credit.

Premises and Equipment

Premises
and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms
of the related leases, whichever is shorter. The maximum estimated useful lives
by asset classification are as follows:

Leasehold
  improvements

10 years

Furniture and
  equipment

3 years

Computer software

3 years

Computer hardware

3 years

We capitalize the costs of computer software developed
or obtained for internal use in accordance with the provisions of SOP 98-1,

Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use

(“SOP 98-1”). Capitalized
computer software costs consist of developed software, purchased software
licenses and implementation costs.

For property and equipment
that is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is
included in noninterest expense in consolidated net income. We had no
capitalized lease obligations at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Lease Obligation

We lease all of our properties. It is our policy to
evaluate and record leases in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 13,

Accounting
for Leases,

(“SFAS No. 13”), Financial Accounting Standards
Board Technical Bulletin No. 88-1,

(“FTB No. 88-1”)
and Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. 13-1,

Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a
Construction Period,

(“FSP No. 13-1”).

At the inception of the
lease, each property is evaluated under SFAS No. 13 to determine whether
the lease will be accounted as an operating or capital lease. We do not have
any capital leases. For leases that contain rent escalations or landlord
incentives, we record the total rent payable during the lease term, as
determined above, using the straight-line method over the term of the lease and
record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight-line rent
as lease obligation in accordance with FTB No. 88-1. We follow FSP No. 13-1
and recognize rent expense for facilities still under construction or leasehold
improvement from the beginning date of the lease, even though the property
cannot yet be occupied.

Goodwill

Goodwill, which arises from the purchase price
exceeding the assigned value of the net assets of an acquired business,
represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being
acquired.

On an annual basis or as circumstances dictate, our
management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may
indicate impairment in the carrying amount. The impairment tests for goodwill
are performed at the reporting unit level and require us to perform a two-step
impairment test. First, we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting
unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the
carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

reporting unit exceeds the
fair value, then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to
determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. We estimate
the reporting unit’s implied fair value by using a discounted cash flow
approach. These estimates involve many assumptions, including expected results
of operations and assumed discount rates. These discount rates are based on
standard industry practice, taking into account the expected equity risk
premium, the size of the business and the probability of the reporting unit
achieving its financial forecasts. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then goodwill impairment is recognized
by writing goodwill down to the implied fair value.

Events that may indicate
goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in results of
operations of the business, economic or political climate, an adverse action or
assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, and a
more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or disposed
of.

Fee-based Services Revenue Recognition

when we have fully completed our contractual and regulatory obligations related
to our client service engagements.

We recognize initial
non-refundable retainer fees over the term of the contract if a term is
specified, otherwise, the fee is recognized at the same time as the related contingent
advisory fee, or when either we or our client terminates the contract.

Letter of Credit
and Standby Letters of Credit Fee Income

Fees generated from
letters of credit and standby letters of credit are deferred as a component of
other liabilities and recognized in noninterest income over the commitment
period using the straight-line method as the probability of the commitment
being exercised was deemed to be remote.

Client Investment
Fees

Client investment fees
earned (excluding Rule 12(b)-1 fees) as well as related expenses
from customer transactions on investment products are recorded on a
settlement-date basis, which is not materially different than trade-date basis.
Rule 12(b) 1 fees are earned and recognized over the period client funds
are invested. Transactional base fees are earned and recognized on fixed income
and equity securities when the transaction is executed on the clients’ behalf.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted
for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Our federal and state income tax provisions are based upon taxes
payable for the current year as well as current year changes in deferred taxes
related to temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement
balances of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
included in the consolidated financial statements at currently enacted income
tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and
liabilities are expected to be realized. As changes in tax laws or rates are
enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision
for income taxes. We file a consolidated federal income tax return, and
consolidated, combined, or separate state income tax returns as appropriate.

Share-Based Compensation

Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for
employee stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method supplemented
by pro forma disclosures in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB No. 25”) and SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, as amended by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosures

. Under the
intrinsic value method, stock options granted with exercise prices equal to the
grant date fair value of our stock have no intrinsic value and therefore no
expense was actually recorded for these options under APB 25. For pro forma
disclosure only, we measured the fair value of our stock options using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model and expensed the value over the
corresponding service period using the straight-line amortization approach. Equity-based
awards for which stock-based compensation expense was actually recorded were
generally grants of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units which
were measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares
granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value was then
recognized as an expense over the corresponding service period using an
accelerated amortization approach in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28
“Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or
Award Plans.”

Effective January 1,
2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
Payment

(“SFAS No. 123(R)”), using the modified prospective
transition method and accordingly prior periods have not been restated to
reflect the impact of SFAS 123(R). Under SFAS 123(R), stock-based awards that
were granted prior to January 1, 2006 are being expensed over the
remaining portion of their vesting period under the same amortization method
and, for stock options, using the same fair value measurements which were used
in calculating pro forma stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123. Under
SFAS 123(R), the fair value of stock options are being measured using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model while the fair value for restricted stock
awards and restricted stock units are based on the quoted price of our common
stock on the date of grant. For all stock-based awards granted on or after January 1,
2006, stock-based compensation expense is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period. SFAS 123(R) requires that the
deferred stock-based compensation on the consolidated balance sheet on the date
of adoption be netted against additional paid-in capital. As of December 31,
2005, there was a balance of $5.8 million of deferred stock-based compensation
that was netted against additional paid-in capital on January 1, 2006.

Earnings Per Share

We calculate earnings
(loss) per common share in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128,

Earnings Per Share

(“SFAS No. 128”).
SFAS No. 128 requires the presentation of basic earnings per share and
diluted earnings per share for companies with potential common shares, such as
warrants and stock options. Accordingly, basic earnings (loss) per common share
is computed using the weighted-average number of common stock shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is
computed using the weighted-average number of common stock shares and potential
common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of
contingently convertible debt (using the “treasury stock” method), and stock
options. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if
the effect is antidilutive. The dilutive effect of our contingently convertible
debt is included in earnings per share in accordance with the provisions of
EITF 04-8,

The Effect of Contingently Convertible
Instruments on Diluted Earnings Per Share

(“EITF 04-8”).

Derivative Financial Instruments

We account for derivative instruments in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended (“SFAS No. 133”).
SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, and requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value. SFAS No. 133 was amended by SFAS No. 138,

Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

(“SFAS No. 138”) and SFAS No. 149,

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

(“SFAS No. 149”). SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149
amended and provided clarification on the accounting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133.

The accounting for changes in fair value of a
derivative depends on whether the derivative instrument is designated and
qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the nature of the
hedging activity.

We define other derivatives
as derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as defined by
SFAS No. 133, or derivatives that have not been designated in a hedging
relationship. Changes in the fair value of other derivatives that do not
qualify for hedge treatment or are not designated in a hedging relationship are
recognized immediately in earnings.

Fair Value Hedges

For derivative instruments
that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge and if the fair value
hedge is fully effective, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument would
offset the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Any
difference that does arise would be the result of hedge ineffectiveness, which
is recognized in earnings. If the derivative instrument meets the qualification
for the short-cut treatment, as defined by SFAS No. 133, the period end
gross positive fair value is recorded in other assets or gross negative fair
values are recorded in other liabilities and an offsetting amount is recorded
to the asset or liability being hedged (see Note 14. Derivative Financial
Instruments).

Equity Warrant
Assets

Equity warrant assets for shares of private and public
companies are recorded at fair value on the grant date and adjusted to fair
value on a quarterly basis through consolidated net income.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

We account for equity warrant assets with net
settlement terms in certain private and public client companies as derivatives.
In general, equity warrant assets entitle us to buy a specific number of shares
of stock at a specific price over a specific time period.

Certain equity warrant
assets contain contingent provisions, which adjust the underlying number of
shares or strike price upon the occurrence of certain future events. Our
warrant agreements contain net share settlement provisions, which permit us to
receive at exercise a share count equal to the intrinsic value of the warrant
divided by the share price (otherwise known as a “cashless” exercise). Because we can net settle
our warrant agreements, our equity warrant assets qualify as derivative
instruments in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133.

Under the accounting treatment required by SFAS No. 133,
equity warrant assets in private and public companies, which include net share
settlement provisions held by SVB Financial Group, are recorded at fair value
and are classified as derivative assets, a component of Other assets, on SVB
Financial Group’s balance sheet at the time they are obtained.

The grant date fair values of equity warrant assets
received in connection with the issuance of a credit facility are deemed to be
loan fees and recognized as an adjustment of loan yield through loan interest
income, as prescribed by SFAS No. 91. Similar to other loan fees, the
yield adjustment related to grant date fair value of warrants is recognized
over the life of that credit facility.

Any changes from the grant date fair value of equity
warrant assets will be recognized as increases or decreases to other assets on
our balance sheet and as net gains or losses on derivative investments, in
noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. When a portfolio
company completes an initial public offering (“IPO”) on a publicly reported
market or is acquired, we may exercise these equity warrant assets for shares
or cash. Upon the latter occurrence of the warrant exercise date or corporate
action date, it is marked to market as a derivative asset with the resulting
change in value recognized as a gain or loss on derivatives in noninterest
income, a component of consolidated net income.

In the event of an exercise for shares, the basis or
value in the equity securities is reclassified from Other assets to Investment
securities on the balance sheet on the latter of the exercise date or corporate
action date. The equity securities are classified as available-for-sale
securities under SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Instrument

(“SFAS No. 115”). In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, changes in fair value of
securities designated as available-for-sale, after applicable taxes, are
excluded from net income and reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income, which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

The fair value of
the equity warrant assets portfolio is reviewed quarterly. We value our equity
warrant assets using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model, which
incorporates the following material assumptions:

·

Underlying
asset value was estimated based on information available, including any
information regarding subsequent rounds of funding.

·

Volatility,
or the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of the changes in the
warrant price, was based on guideline publicly traded companies within indices
similar in nature to the underlying client companies issuing the warrant. A
total of ten such indices were used. The volatility assumption was based on the
median volatility for an individual public company within an index for each
quarter from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2006, from which an
average volatility was derived. The weighted average quarterly median
volatility assumption used for the warrant valuation at December 31, 2006
was 42.1%, compared to 47.4% at December 31, 2005.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

·

Actual
data on cancellations, expirations and exercises of our warrants was utilized
as the basis for determining the expected remaining life of the warrants in
each financial reporting period. Warrants may be exercised in the event of
acquisitions, mergers or IPOs, and cancelled due to events such as
bankruptcies, restructuring activities or additional financings. This
assumption reduced the reported value of the warrant portfolio by $12.4 million
at December 31, 2006.

·

The
risk-free interest rates were derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The
risk-free interest rate was calculated based on a weighted average of the
risk-free interest rates that correspond closest to the expected remaining life
of the warrant.

Foreign Exchange
Forwards

We enter into foreign
exchange forward contracts with clients involved in international trade finance
activities. We also enter into an opposite-way foreign exchange forward
contract with a correspondent bank, which mitigates the risk of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, for each of the contracts entered into with
our clients. However, settlement, credit, and operational risks remain. We also
enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with correspondent banks to
economically hedge foreign exchange exposure risk related to certain foreign
currency denominated loans. These contracts are not designated as hedging
instruments and are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets.
Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately in
consolidated net income under gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net, a
component of noninterest income. Period ended gross positive fair values are
recorded in other assets and gross negative fair values are recorded in other
liabilities.

Foreign Exchange
Option Contracts

We enter into foreign currency option contracts with
clients involved in international trade finance activities, either as the
purchaser or seller of foreign currency options, depending upon the client’s
need. For each of the currency option contracts entered into with our clients,
we enter into an opposite way foreign currency option contract with a
correspondent bank, which mitigates the risk of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are
recognized immediately in consolidated net income under net gains (losses) on
derivative instruments, a component of noninterest income. Period ended gross
positive fair values are recorded in other assets and gross negative fair
values are recorded in other liabilities.

Derivative
Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
Stock

We account for
non-hedging contracts that are indexed to, and potentially settled in, a
company’s own stock in accordance with the provisions of EITF 00-19,

Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and
Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock

(“EITF 00-19”).
EITF 00-19 provides for specific treatment of derivative financial
instruments indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company’s own stock,
depending on the settlement method. The settlement methods are:

·

Physical
settlement—the party designated in the contract as the buyer delivers the full
stated amount of cash to the seller, and the seller delivers the full stated
number of shares to the buyer


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

·

Net-share
settlement—the party with a loss delivers to the party with a gain, shares with
a current fair value equal to the gain

·

Net-cash
settlement—the party with a loss delivers to the party with a gain, a cash
payment equal to the gain, and no shares are exchanged.

EITF 00-19 specifies
how a derivative financial instrument indexed to, and potentially settled in, a
company’s own stock should be recorded as one of permanent equity, temporary
equity, an asset or a liability depending on the settlement method. EITF 00-19
also includes provisions governing whether a derivative embedded into a
financial instrument indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company’s own
stock may be exempt from the provisions of SFAS No. 133.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140

(“SFAS
No. 155”). Hybrid financial instruments are financial instruments that
contain an embedded derivative within a single instrument. SFAS 155 gives
entities an option to elect to record hybrid financial instruments at fair
value as one financial instrument. Prior to this amendment, under certain
conditions, hybrid financial instruments were required to be separated into two
instruments, a derivative and host, and generally only the derivative was
recorded at fair value. SFAS No. 155 requires that beneficial interests in
securitized assets be evaluated for derivatives, either freestanding or
embedded. In January 2007, the FASB provided a scope exception for
securitized interests that (1) only contain an embedded derivative that is
tied to the prepayment risk of the underlying prepayable financial assets and (2) the
investor does not control the right to accelerate the settlement. SFAS No. 155
is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after January 1,
2007. Additionally, SFAS No. 155 provides a one-time opportunity to apply
the fair value election to hybrid financial instruments existing at the date of
implementation at fair value as one financial instrument, with any difference
between the carrying amount of the existing hybrid financial instruments and
the fair value of the single financial instrument being recorded as a
cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. We do not expect
the adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position and results of operations.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,

Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, an
amendment of SFAS No. 140

(“SFAS No. 156”). SFAS No. 156
clarifies when an entity should separately recognize servicing assets and servicing
liabilities when it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by
entering into a servicing contract. SFAS No. 156 requires that all
separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially
measured at fair value and subsequently measured using either the amortization
method as previously permitted under SFAS No. 140 or the fair value
measurement method. Entities are permitted to make an election to subsequently
re-measure classes of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities.
Once the fair value measurement method is elected for a class, the election
should be applied prospectively to all new and existing separately recognized
servicing assets and servicing liabilities within that class. The effect of re-measuring
an existing class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing
liabilities at fair value would be reported as a cumulative-effect adjustment
to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. SFAS No. 156
is


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

effective as of the
beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after September 15,
2006. Earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal
year, provided the entity has not yet issued interim financial statements for
that fiscal year. In the first quarter of 2006, we elected not to early adopt
this Statement and, accordingly, will adopt it as of January 1, 2007. We
are currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 156 on our consolidated
financial position and results of operations.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), to clarify the accounting for
uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes that a two-step benefit recognition
model be applied initially to recognize and measure the benefit amount of a tax
position. The first step requires that a tax benefit be recognized only when
the tax position is “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained based on the
technical merits of the position. Assuming the first step is met, the second
step requires that the benefit amount be measured at the largest amount that
has at least a “more-likely-than-not” likelihood of being the ultimate outcome
based on a cumulative-probability approach. Tax positions that previously
failed to meet the “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold should be
recognized in the period in which the threshold is subsequently met, the tax
matter is resolved or the statute of limitations for examining the tax position
has expired. FIN 48 requires that a previously recognized tax benefit be
de-recognized in the period it becomes “more-likely-than-not” that the tax
position would not be sustained on audit. The impact of applying FIN 48 should
be recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings
at the adoption date. The Interpretation is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. The FASB is currently engaged in a
project to provide implementation guidance on FIN 48. While the effects of FIN
48 will depend somewhat upon this implementation guidance, we expect the
transition effects of this standard to be modest with an immaterial impact on our
opening balance of retained earnings at January 1, 2007.

In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing
the impact of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial position and
results of operations.

In September 2004,
the EITF reached final consensus on EITF 04-8 whereby contingently
convertible debt should be treated as convertible debt and included in the

convertible debt using the treasury stock method was approximately 1.3 million

assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method were calculated by subtracting
the aggregate weighted average conversion price from the average market price
of the shares related to the contingently convertible debt.

Share-Based
Compensation

Impact of Adopting
SFAS 123(R)

For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded
share-based compensation expense of $21.3 million resulting in the recognition
of $4.6 million in related tax benefits. For the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, we recognized $7.1 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of
stock-based compensation expense under the intrinsic value method of APB 25,
resulting in the recognition of $2.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in
related tax benefits. No compensation cost was capitalized in the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 or 2004, as such amount was inconsequential. As a result of adopting
SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006, our income before income tax expense
and net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $15.5 million and
$13.4 million lower, respectively, than if we had continued to account for
stock-based compensation under APB 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for
the year ended December 31, 2006 were $0.39 and $0.36 lower, respectively,
than if we had continued to account for stock-based compensation under APB 25.

SFAS 123(R) requires
forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Share-based
compensation expense was recorded net of estimated forfeitures for the year
ended December 31, 2006 such that expense was recorded only for those
share-based awards that are expected to vest. Previously under APB 25, to the
extent awards were forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously
recognized expense was reversed in the period of forfeiture. Upon adoption of
SFAS 123(R) as of January 1, 2006, we recorded a cumulative
adjustment of $0.2 million to account for the expected forfeitures of
restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted prior to January 1,
2006, for which we previously recorded an expense.

Equity Incentive
Plans

On May 11, 2006, stockholders approved the 2006
Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Incentive Plan”). Our previous 1997 Equity
Incentive Plan expired in December 2006. The 2006 Incentive Plan provides
for the grant of various types of incentive awards, of which the following have
been granted: (i) stock options; (ii) restricted stock;
(iii) restricted stock units; and (iv) other stock awards. We also
issued performance units in May 2006 under the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan.

Subject to the provisions of Section 14 of the
2006 Incentive Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be awarded
and sold is 3,000,000 shares plus 1,488,361 shares comprising of: (i) any
shares that have been reserved but not issued under our 1997 Equity Incentive
Plan as of May 11, 2006; and (ii) any shares subject to stock options
or similar awards granted under the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan that expire or
otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full and shares issued
pursuant to awards granted under the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan that are
forfeited or repurchased by us. No further awards will be made under the 1997
Equity Incentive Plan, but it will continue to govern awards previously granted
thereunder.

Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units
will be counted against the numerical limits of the 2006 Incentive Plan as two
shares for every one share subject thereto. Further, if shares acquired
pursuant to any such award are forfeited or repurchased by us and would
otherwise return to the 2006 Incentive Plan pursuant to the terms thereof, two
times the number of shares so forfeited or repurchased will return to the 2006
Incentive Plan and will again become available for issuance.

Eligible participants in
the 2006 Incentive Plan include directors, employees, and consultants. Options
granted under the 2006 Incentive Plan generally expire seven years after the
grant date. Options generally become exercisable over various periods,
typically four years, from the grant date based on continued employment, and
typically vest annually. Restricted stock awards generally vest over the
passage of time and require continued employment through the vesting period. Restricted
stock units generally vest upon meeting certain performance-based objectives or
the passage of time, or a combination of both, and require continued employment
through the vesting period. The vesting period for restricted stock units
cannot be less than three years unless they are subject to certain
performance-based objectives, in which case the vesting period can be 12 months
or longer.

Employee Stock
Purchase Plan

We maintain an employee
stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) under which participating employees may annually
contribute up to 10% of their gross compensation to purchase shares of our
common stock at 85% of its fair market value at either the beginning or end of
each six-month offering period, whichever price is less. To be eligible to
participate in the ESPP, an employee must, among other requirements, be age 18
or above and complete at least one hour of service as an employee of us or any
of our affiliates. There were 115,628 shares issued under the ESPP for the year
ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, a total of 870,985
shares of our common stock were still available for future issuance under the
ESPP. The next purchase will be on June 29, 2007 at the end of the current
six-month offering period. Effective January 1, 2006, we began recognizing
compensation expense associated with the ESPP in accordance with SFAS 123(R).

The expected term was
based on the implied term of the stock options using a lattice option-pricing
model with early exercise factors based on historic employee exercise behavior.
The expected volatilities for the 2006 Incentive Plan for the year ended December 31,
2004 were calculated based on historical volatilities. However, in light of new
accounting guidance under SFAS 123R, beginning in the first quarter of 2005,
management determined that using a blended rate consisting of equal measures of
our historic volatility and our expected volatility over a five-year term was a
better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than
historical volatility. Therefore, for the years ended December 31, 2006
and 2005, expected volatilities under the 2006 Incentive Plan were calculated
based on a blended rate. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, expected volatilities for ESPP were equal to the historical volatility
for the previous six-month periods. The expected risk-free interest rates were

As of December 31, 2006, we identified a total of
145 investments that were in unrealized loss positions, of which 137
investments totaling $1,308.8 million with unrealized losses of $32.2 million
had fair values less than their adjusted cost for a period of time greater than
12 months. A U.S. Treasury note totaling $9.9 million with an unrealized loss
of $0.1 million was purchased in July 2005. Securities classified as
collateralized mortgage obligations totaling $616.5 million with
unrealized losses of $14.7 million were originally purchased between July 1998
and September 2005. Securities classified as mortgage-backed securities
totaling $392.1 million with unrealized losses of $11.6 million were originally
purchased between August 2002 and April 2005. Securities classified
as U.S. agency debentures totaling $220.9 million with unrealized losses of
$4.1 million were originally purchased between February 2003 and July 2005.
Securities classified as commercial mortgage-backed securities totaling $69.4
million with unrealized losses of $1.8 million were originally purchased
between April 2005 and July 2005. All investments with unrealized losses
for a period of time greater than 12 months are either rated AAA by Moody’s or
S&P or are issued by the U.S. Government or a government-sponsored
enterprise. Because these securities are of superior credit quality, the
unrealized losses are due solely to increases in market interest rates and we
expect to recover the impairment prior to or at maturity, we deem these
impairments to be temporary. We have the intent and ability to hold the
securities until the market value recovers or until maturity. Market valuations
and impairment analyses on assets in the investment portfolio are reviewed and
monitored on an ongoing basis.

The
following table breaks out our unrealized losses on our available-for-sale

Investment Securities—Remaining Contractual Principal
Maturities and Yields (Fully Taxable-Equivalent Basis)

The
following table provides the remaining contractual principal maturities and
fully taxable-equivalent yields on investment securities as of December 31,
2006. Interest income on certain obligations of states and political
subdivision (non-taxable investments) are presented on a fully
taxable-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. The
weighted-average yield is computed using the


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

amortized cost of available-for-sale securities, which
are reported at fair value. Expected remaining maturities of callable U.S.
agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage obligations
may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because borrowers
have the right to prepay obligations with or without penalties. This is most
apparent in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations
as contractual maturities are typically 15 to 30 years, whereas expected
average lives of these securities are significantly shorter and vary based upon
structure. Private equity fund investments, other private equity investments,
other investments, and low income housing tax credit funds are included in the
table below as maturing after 10 years.

classified for financial reporting purposes based upon the purpose and primary
source of repayment of the loans. Loans are classified for regulatory reporting
purposes based upon the type of collateral securing the loans.

A
substantial percentage of our loans are commercial in nature, and such loans
are generally made to emerging-growth or corporate technology companies in a

The aggregate recorded
investment in loans for which impairment has been determined in accordance with
SFAS No. 114 totaled $11.0 million and $6.5 million at December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2006,
nonaccrual loans represented all impaired loans. There were no commitments
available for funding to any clients with nonaccrual loans at December 31,
2006. No individual loans were deemed to be impaired under SFAS No. 114 at
December 31, 2006 or 2005; therefore, there was no allocation of the
allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans at December 31, 2006
or 2005. The allocation of the allowance for loan losses related to impaired
loans was $4.2 million at December 31, 2004. Average impaired loans for
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $8.1 million,
$13.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively. If these loans had not been
impaired, $0.8 million, $1.0 million and $1.1 million in interest income
would have been recorded during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. We recorded $0.6 million and $1.1 million interest
income for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and
no interest income on such impaired loans for the year ended December 31,
2004.

Goodwill

Goodwill, which arises from the purchase price
exceeding the assigned value of the net assets of an acquired business,
represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being
acquired. Goodwill at December 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled $21.3 million and
$35.6 million, respectively. Goodwill resulted from the acquisition of SVB
Alliant, our investment banking subsidiary, and eProsper, our equity ownership
data management services company.

In connection with our
annual assessment of goodwill of SVB Alliant during the second quarter of 2006,
we concluded that we had an impairment of goodwill based on forecasted
discounted net cash flows for that reporting unit. In measuring the amount of
goodwill impairment, we made a hypothetical allocation of the reporting unit’s
estimated fair value to the tangible and intangible assets (other than
goodwill) of the reporting unit. Based on this allocation, we concluded that
$18.4 million of the related goodwill was impaired and was required to be
expensed as a non-cash charge to continuing operations during the second
quarter of 2006. Thus, the goodwill balance related to SVB Alliant was reduced
from $35.6 million at December 31, 2005 to $17.2 million at June 30,
2006. As of December 31, 2006, there were no further indications of
impairment beyond that already identified and recorded.

Deposits

The aggregate amount of

million, $1.6 million and $1.7 million for years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2006, time deposit accounts,
individually exceeding $100,000 totaling $264.0 million were scheduled to
mature within one year.

ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The weighted
average interest rate of our borrowings outstanding for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 4.26%, 2.27% and 1.40%, respectively.

Contingently
Convertible Debt

We issued
$150.0 million of zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes at face value,
due June 15, 2008, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 and outside the United States
to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933.
The notes are convertible into the Company’s common stock at a conversion price
of $33.6277 per share and are subordinated to all of our present and future
senior debt. Holders of the notes may convert their notes only if: (i) the
price of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of a note reaches
a specified threshold, (ii) specified corporate transactions occur, or
(iii) the trading price for the notes falls below certain thresholds.

The
fair value of the convertible debt at December 31, 2006 and

2005 was $207.7
million and $212.6
million, respectively, based on quoted market prices. We intend to settle
the outstanding principal amount in cash. Based on the terms of the notes, if,
at any time before June 15, 2007, the per share stock price on the last
trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter was 110% or more of the
conversion price, the notes would become convertible. The notes were
convertible during 2006, due to the share price exceeding 110% of the
conversion price at each fiscal quarter end during 2006. Accordingly, during
2006, our note holders held the right, at their option, to convert their notes,
in whole or in part, subject to certain limitations, at the conversion price of
$33.6277. We received conversion notices relating to the notes in an aggregate
principal amount of $104.0 thousand and $64.0 thousand in 2006 and 2005, respectively.
No conversions occurred prior to 2005.

Concurrent with the
issuance of the convertible notes, we entered into a convertible note hedge
(see Note 14. Derivative Financial Instruments—Derivative Financial Instruments
Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock).

7.0% Junior Subordinated Debentures

On October 30, 2003,
we issued $51.5 million in 7.0% junior subordinated debentures to a
special-purpose trust, SVB Capital II. Distributions to SVB Capital II are
cumulative and are payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 7.0% per annum of the
face value of the junior subordinated debentures. Distributions for each of the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $3.5 million. The junior
subordinated debentures are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the
debentures on October 15, 2033, or to the extent that we redeem any
debentures earlier. We may redeem the debentures prior to maturity in whole or
in part, at our option, at any time on or after October 30, 2008. In
addition, we may redeem the debentures, in whole but not in part, prior to
October 30, 2008, upon the occurrence of certain events. Issuance costs of
$2.2 million related to the junior subordinated debentures were deferred and
are being amortized over the period until mandatory redemption of the
debentures in October 2033. We entered into a fixed-to-variable interest
rate swap agreement related to these junior subordinated debentures (see Note
14. Derivative Financial Instruments). The fair value of the 7.0% junior subordinated
debentures is

preferred securities issued by SVB Capital II (see Note 13. Commitments and
Contingencies).

Available Lines of Credit

As of December 31,
2006, we had available $1.0 billion in uncommitted federal funds lines of
credit of which $690.0 million were unused. We have repurchase agreement lines
available with multiple securities dealers. Repurchase lines allow us to
finance short-term borrowings using various fixed income securities as
collateral. As of December 31, 2006, we borrowed $178.0 million against
our repurchase lines. Additionally, we have collateral pledged to the Federal
Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco of which $90.0 million
collectively is unused.

Operating Leases

We are
obligated under a number of noncancelable operating leases for premises and

include options to renew or extend at market rates and terms. Such leases may
provide for periodic adjustments of rentals during the term of the lease based
on changes in various economic indicators. The following table presents minimum

Derivative
Financial Instruments

If held for hedging purposes we designate the
derivative when we enter into a derivative contract. The designation
may change based on management’s reassessment or changing circumstances.
Derivative instruments that we obtain or use include interest rate swaps,
forward contracts, options and warrants. A swap agreement is a contract between
two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional
amounts, assets or indices. Forward settlement contracts are agreements to buy
or sell a quantity of a financial instrument, index, currency or commodity at a
predetermined future date, rate or price. An option or warrant contract is an
agreement that conveys to the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to
buy or sell a quantity of a financial instrument (including another derivative
financial instrument), index, currency or commodity at a predetermined rate or
price during a period or at a time in the future. Option or warrant agreements
can be transacted on organized exchanges or directly between parties. The gross
positive fair values of derivative assets are recorded as a component of the
other assets line item on the

balance sheet. The gross
negative fair values of derivative liabilities are recorded as a component of
the other liabilities line item on the balance sheet.

The
total notional or contractual amounts, credit risk amount and estimated net

Fair Value Hedges

Derivative instruments that we hold as a part of our
interest rate risk management program include interest rate swaps and forward
contracts. On October 30, 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap
agreement with a notional amount of $50.0 million. This agreement hedges
against the risk of changes in fair values associated with the majority of our
7.0% fixed rate, junior subordinated debentures, which management evaluates for
effectiveness using the statistical regression analysis approach for each
reporting period. For information on our junior subordinated debentures, see
Note 12. Borrowings.

The terms of the interest
rate swap agreement provide for a swap of our 7.0% fixed rate payment for a
variable rate based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a
spread. This interest rate swap agreement provided a cash benefit of $0.3
million, $1.2 million and $2.2 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
related to interest expense that would have been incurred under a 7% fixed
interest rate; which was recognized in the consolidated statements of income as
a reduction in interest expense. The swap agreement largely mirrors the terms
of the junior subordinated debentures and therefore is callable by the
counterparty anytime on or after October 30, 2008. All components of the swap’s
gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Changes in
fair value of the fair value hedge agreement, which is primarily dependent on
changes in market interest rates, are recognized in net income as gains or
losses on derivative instruments. We recorded a non-cash decrease in fair value
of the fair value hedge agreement of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2006, which is comprised of a decrease in fair value of $3.3 million for the
interest rate swap agreement prior to its designation as a fair value hedge and
a $0.3 million loss for the fair value hedge agreement implemented in April
2006, which were reflected in gains on derivative instruments, net.

Derivatives—Other

We enter into various derivative contracts primarily
to provide derivative products or services to customers. These derivatives are
not linked to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to
forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge relationship and, therefore, do
not qualify for hedge accounting. All of these contracts are carried at fair
value with changes in fair value recorded on the line item gains (losses) on
derivatives, net as part of our noninterest income, a component of consolidated
net income.

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and
non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts with clients involved in
international trade finance activities, either as the purchaser or seller of
foreign currency at a future date, depending upon the clients’ need. For each
of the foreign exchange forward contracts and non-deliverable foreign exchange
forward contracts entered into with our clients, we enter into an opposite way
foreign exchange forward contract and non-deliverable foreign exchange forward
contract with a correspondent bank, which mitigates the risk of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are short-term in nature,
typically expiring within one year. We have not experienced nonperformance by
counterparties and therefore have not incurred related losses. Further, we
anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements.

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with
correspondent banks to economically hedge foreign exchange exposure risk
related to certain foreign currency denominated loans. Revaluations of foreign
currency denominated loans are recorded on the line item “Other” as part of
noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. These contracts are
short term in nature, typically expiring within one year. We have not
experienced nonperformance by counterparties and therefore have not incurred
related losses. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to
such foreign exchange forward contracts.

We enter into foreign currency option contracts with
clients involved in international trade finance activities, either as the
purchaser or seller of foreign currency options, depending upon the client’s
need. For each of the currency option contracts entered into with our clients,
we enter into an opposite way foreign currency option contract with a
correspondent bank, which mitigates the risk of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates. These contracts typically expire in less than one
year. We have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties and therefore
have not incurred related losses. Further, we anticipate performance by all
counterparties.

We obtain equity warrant
assets to purchase an equity position in a client company’s stock in
consideration for providing credit facilities and less frequently for providing
other services. The purpose of obtaining warrants from client companies is
intended to increase future revenue.

The change in fair value of equity warrant assets is recorded as gains on
derivative instruments, net, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated
net income. The change in fair value of the equity warrant assets
resulted in a net gain of $10.3 million, a net loss of $5.7 million and a net
loss of $1.5 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Derivative Fair Value Instruments Indexed to, and
Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock

Concurrent with the issuance of the $150.0 million
principal amount of contingently convertible notes, we entered into a
convertible note hedge (purchased call option) at a cost of $39.3 million and a
warrant transaction providing proceeds of $17.4 million with respect to our
common stock, with the objective of decreasing our exposure to potential
dilution from conversion of the contingently convertible notes.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

At issuance, under the terms of the convertible note
hedge, upon the occurrence of conversion events, we acquired the right to
purchase up to approximately 4,460,610 shares of our common stock from the
counterparty at a price of $33.6277 per common share. The convertible note
hedge agreement will expire on June 15, 2008. We have the option to settle
any amounts due under the convertible hedge either in cash or net shares of our
common stock. The cost of the convertible note hedge is included in
stockholders’ equity in accordance with the guidance in EITF 00-19. In
2006, we exercised our right to purchase 3,093 shares under the terms of the
convertible bond hedge.

At issuance, under the
warrant agreement, the counterparty could purchase up to approximately 4,460,608
shares of our common stock at $51.34 per share, upon the occurrence of
conversion events defined above. The warrant transaction will expire on June 15,
2008. The proceeds of the warrant transaction were included in stockholders’
equity in accordance with the guidance in EITF 00-19. Due to conversion
events in 2006, the counterparty’s right to purchase our stock under warrant
has been decreased by 3,093 shares. Also see Note 3. Earnings Per Share.

Employee
Benefit Plans

We have the following
employee benefit plans:  (i) Equity Incentive Plans; (ii) Employee
Stock Purchase Plan; (iii) Incentive Compensation Plans; (iv) Direct
Drive Incentive Compensation Plan; (v) Retention Plan; (vi) Warrant
Incentive Plan; (vii) SVB Financial Group 401(k) and Employee Stock
Ownership Plan; (viii) Employee Home Ownership Plan; (ix) SVB
Qualified Investors Fund LLC; (x) SVB Qualified Investors Fund II, LLC;
and (xi) Deferred Compensation Plan. The Equity Incentive Plans and the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan are described in Note 4. Share-Based Compensation.

Incentive Compensation Plans

Incentive Compensation
Plans (“ICP”) are bonus programs paid based on the financial results of our
various business units. Awards are distributed based on management’s assessment
of individual employee performance. Our total contributions to the ICP were $24.5
million, $26.6 million and $28.6 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan

Direct Drive Incentive
Compensation Plan (“Direct Drive”) is a semiannual sales incentive program.
Payments are based on sales teams’ performance to predetermined financial
targets. Actual awards for each sales team member under Direct Drive is based
on: (i) the actual results and financial performance with respect to the
gross profit targets; (ii) the sales team payout targets; and (iii) the
sales team member’s sales position and team payout allocation. We define gross
profit targets as the revenue goals for total interest income after funds
transfer pricing and noninterest income. Income associated with equity warrant
assets is not included in the gross profit targets. Additionally, sales team
members may receive a discretionary award based on management’s assessment of
such member’s contributions and performance during the applicable fiscal year,
regardless of achievement of team gross profit targets. Direct Drive expenses
were $5.7 million, $6.0 million and $5.1 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Retention Program

The Retention Program
("RP") is a long-term incentive plan that allows executives to share
directly in the Company's investment success. Under the RP, a separate plan is
adopted and plan participants are designated for each fiscal year. Plan
participants are granted an interest in the distributions made on certain
designated investments made by the Company, as well as certain fees received by
the Company (or its affiliates), during the applicable year. Specifically,
participants share in: (i) returns from designated investments made by the
Company and its affiliates, including investments in certain private equity
funds, venture debt funds, and direct equity investments in companies; (ii) income
realized from the exercise of, and the subsequent sale of shares obtained
through the exercise of, warrants held by the Company; (iii) SVB Alliant
revenues; and (iv) other designated amounts as determined by the Company.
The Company determines individual allocations in the RP based on individual
performance, the individual's role and the total number of plan participants.
Each allocation gives the participant a stated percentage or dollar interest in
the future returns on the designated investments and fees in the pool. The
interests are not in the underlying investments themselves, but rather in
future distributions or returns to the Company on such investments.
Distributions received by the Company are paid to the participants over the
term of the applicable plan, which is generally ten years. RP expenses were $1.5 million,
$1.1 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Warrant Incentive Plan

The Warrant Incentive Plan
provides individual and team awards to those employees who negotiate warrants
on the behalf of the Company. Designated participants share in the income
realized from the exercise of, and the subsequent sale of shares obtained
through the exercise of, warrants held by the Company. The WIN Pool Program, a
component of the Warrant Incentive Plan, provides a pooled opportunity to
employees across the Company who are not otherwise eligible for the Warrant
Incentive Plan or RP to share in income realized from the exercise and sale of
warrants. Warrant Incentive Plan (including the WIN Pool Program) expenses were
$1.2 million, $1.3 million and $1.0 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

SVB
Financial Group 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The SVB Financial Group 401(k) (the “401(k) Plan”)
and Employee Stock Ownership (“ESOP”) Plan (collectively referred to as the “Plan”)
is a combined 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan and employee stock
ownership plan in which all regular employees are eligible to participate.

Employees participating in the 401(k) Plan are
allowed to contribute up to 75% of their pre-tax compensation as defined in the
Plan, up to the maximum amount allowable under federal income tax regulations
of $15,000 and $14,000 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. We match the employee’s contributions dollar-for-dollar, up to 5%
of the employee’s pre-tax compensation as defined in the Plan. Our matching
contributions vest immediately. Our matching 401(k) Plan contributions
totaled $4.1 million, $4.5 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of salary deferred, up to the
allowed maximum, is not subject to federal or state income taxes at the time of
deferral.

Discretionary ESOP contributions, based on our
consolidated net income, are made by us to all eligible individuals employed by
us on the last day of the fiscal year. We may elect to contribute cash, or our
common stock, in an amount not exceeding 10.0% of the employee’s eligible
compensation earned in the fiscal year. The ESOP contributions vest in equal
annual increments over five years. Forfeited balances of terminated
participants’ nonvested accounts are used first to restore previously forfeited
amounts of rehired participants’ accounts and are then used to pay
administrative expenses and to reduce our future contributions to the Plan.
Forfeited nonvested accounts totaled $0.7 million and $0.4 million at December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2006, Company contributions to the Plan
were reduced by $0.4 million from forfeited nonvested accounts, and
administrative expenses totaling $0.2 million were paid from the forfeited
nonvested accounts.

Our contributions to the ESOP totaled $5.4 million,
$6.3 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2006, the ESOP owned 629,092
shares of our common stock. All shares held by the ESOP are treated as outstanding
shares in both our basic and diluted earnings per share computations. At December 31,
2006, we had not committed any additional shares to the ESOP program.

We amended the Plan in
2004 and added a Profit Sharing Account, which is employee directed. Discretionary
Profit Sharing Contributions, subject to our determination will be made to all
eligible individuals who are employed on the last day of the fiscal year.

Employee Home Ownership Plan

The Employee Home Ownership Plan (“EHOP”) is a benefit
plan that provides for the issuance of mortgage loans at favorable interest
rates to eligible employees. Eligible employees may apply for a fixed-rate
mortgage, which is due and payable in either five or seven years on their
primary residence and is amortized over a 30 year period. Applicants must
qualify for a loan through the usual mortgage review and approval process,
which is typical of industry standards. The maximum loan amount cannot be
greater than 80.0% of the lesser of the purchase price or the appraised value.
The interest rate on the note is written at the then market rate for five year
(5/1) or seven year (7/1) mortgage loans as determined by us. However, provided
that the applicant continues to meet all the eligibility requirements,
including employment, the actual rate charged to the borrower shall be 2.0%
below the market rate. The loan rate shall not be less than the greater of
either the five-year Treasury Note plus 25 basis points (for the five year
loan) or the average of the five year and 10 year Treasury Note plus 25 basis
points (for the seven year loan) or the monthly Applicable Federal Rate for
medium-term loans as published by the Internal Revenue Service. The loan rate
will be fixed at the time of approval and locked in for 30 days. We recognize
as compensation expense the aggregate dollar amount by which interest charged
to an employee under the EHOP is less than the market rate of interest that
would be charged for a comparable loan. Compensation expense attributable to
loans issued under the EHOP for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004 was $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

SVB Qualified Investors Fund, LLC  and SVB Qualified Investors Fund II, LLC

SVB Qualified Investor
Fund LLC (“QIF”) was formed on behalf of certain eligible employees. QIF was
initially fully capitalized by equity contributions by employees. QIF’s
principal purpose is to invest in a select number of private equity funds
managed primarily by SVB Financial or its affiliates. The fund will continue
until December 12, 2013, unless terminated sooner or extended in
accordance with the fund operating agreement. In 2005, we formed SVB Qualified
Investors Fund II, LLC (“QIF II”), which is structured similarly as QIF. QIF II
will continue until April 8, 2018, unless terminated sooner or extended in
accordance with the fund operating agreement. For the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005, we incurred fund administration costs of approximately $0.1
million and $0.2 million, respectively for both QIF and QIF II. For the year
ended December 31, 2004, we incurred costs of $0.1 million for QIF.

Deferred Compensation Plan

In October 2004, we
established the Silicon Valley Bank Deferred Compensation Plan (the “DC Plan”).
The DC Plan became effective on January 1, 2005. Under the DC Plan,
eligible employees may elect to defer up to 25% of their base salary and/or up
to 100% of any bonus payment to which they are entitled, for a period of 12
consecutive months, beginning January 1 and ending December 31.
Executive officers and certain senior managers are eligible to participate in
the DC Plan, and any amounts deferred under the DC Plan will be invested and
administered by us (or such person we designate). Deferrals under the DC Plan
were $1.1 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006
and 2005, respectively. Gains on the DC Plan investments for the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $129.4 thousand and $19.8 thousand,
respectively.

Loan Transactions

SVB Financial Group (the Parent) has a commitment
under a revolving line of credit facility to Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP,
a venture debt fund (“Gold Hill”), and its affiliated funds. SVB Financial
Group has a 9.3% effective ownership interest in Gold Hill, as well as a 90.7%
majority interest in its general partner, Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners
03, LLC. The line of credit bears an interest rate of prime plus one percent.
During the year ended December 31, 2006, SVB Financial Group renewed the
line of credit for an additional year until August 2007 and increased the
commitment amount to $40.0 million. The highest aggregate balance outstanding
during 2006 was $40.0 million.

In August 2000, SVB Financial Group made an
unsecured interest-free loan in the amount of $0.5 million to Marc Verissimo, our
Chief Strategy Officer. The largest principal amount outstanding during 2006
was $0.5 million. The loan was repaid in full in February 2006.

During 2006, the Bank made
loans to related parties, including certain companies in which certain of our
directors or venture funds with which some of our directors are affiliated, are
beneficial owners of ten percent or more of the equity securities of such
companies. Such loans: (a) were made in the ordinary course of business,
(b) were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates
and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions
with other persons, and (c) did not involve more than the normal risk of
collectibility or present other unfavorable features. The following are some of
such loans, which have previously been disclosed in our prior periodic reports:


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Bank renewed a line of credit in the amount of
$1.0 million to Skalli Corporation (dba St. Supery Vineyards and Winery) in
October 2006. Michaela Rodeno, one of our directors, is the Chief
Executive Officer of St. Supery. The loan expires in October 2008, with
interest payable monthly. The interest rate for this loan is 30-day LIBOR plus
225 basis points. The largest principal amount outstanding during 2006 was
$300,000.

In May 2006, the Bank extended a revolving line
of credit in the aggregate amount of $60.0 million to NEA XII, LP. Amounts
outstanding under the line of credit are secured by the right to receive
proceeds of capital calls from the borrower’s limited partners. C. Richard
Kramlich, one of our directors, is a partner of NEA Partners 12, LP, which acts
as the General Partner for NEA XII, LP. The line of credit has an interest
rate of prime or 30-day LIBOR plus 275 basis points, at the borrower’s
option. The maturity date of the line of credit is May 11, 2007. The
largest principal amount outstanding during 2006 was $45.5 million.

In April 2006, the Bank issued a letter of credit
in the amount of $0.2 million on behalf of SurgRx, Inc. The initial
maturity date of the letter of credit is April 4, 2007, but the letter of
credit will be automatically renewed unless affirmatively terminated by SurgRx
until its final expiry on May 10, 2010. The letter of credit is secured by
a certificate of deposit pledged by SurgRx, Inc. and held by the Bank. David
Clapper, one of our directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of
SurgRx, Inc. The largest principal amount outstanding under the line of
credit during 2006 was $0.2 million.

In December 2004, the
Bank extended a line of credit in the amount of $1.3 million to Deer
VI & Co, LLC, with which Felda Hardymon, one of our directors, is a
member with a non-voting interest. The loan was unsecured and was fully
guaranteed by Deer Management Co., LLC, with which Mr. Hardymon is also a
member with a non-voting interest. The original line expired in
September 2005, and was extended and increased to $2.0 million in
November 2005. The increased line expires in September 2007, with
interest payable quarterly. The interest rate for the loan was the Bank’s prime
rate minus one half of one percent. The largest principal amount outstanding
during 2006 was $1.7 million.

Fund Investments

In 2000, we formed two venture investment funds: SVB
Strategic Investors Fund, LP (“SIF I”) and Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP
(“SVBV”). SIF I is a $121.8 million fund that primarily invests in private
equity funds and SVBV is a $56.1 million direct equity investment fund that
invests in privately-held companies. Both funds are managed by their respective
general partners, which are wholly-owned subsidiaries and hold a minority
interest in the respective funds. Certain of our directors have also invested
in the funds and hold a minority interest: Messrs. Hardymon (through his
family limited partnership) ($0.9 million) and Porter ($0.5 million) are
limited partners of SIF I, and Messrs. Hardymon (through his family
limited partnership) ($1.5 million) and Kramlich ($1.0 million) are limited
partners of SVBV. Mr. H.A. Schupf, a principal stockholder, is also a
limited partner of SVBV ($0.5 million).

In 2004, we created SVB Strategic Investors Fund II,
LP (“SIF II”). SIF II is a $175.0 million fund-of-funds that invests primarily
in private equity funds. SIF II is managed by its general partner, which is a
wholly-owned subsidiary and holds a minority interest in the fund. Certain of
our directors have invested in SIF II and hold a minority interest as a limited
partner: Messrs. Hardymon (through his family limited partnership) ($1.0
million) and Porter ($0.1 million).

In 2006, we created SVB India Capital Partners I, LP
(“SICP”), a $33.9 million direct equity investment fund that invests in
privately-held companies in India. SICP is managed by its general partner,

which is a wholly-owned
subsidiary and holds a minority interest in the fund. Certain of our directors
have invested in SICP and hold a minority interest as a limited partner:
Messrs. Benhamou (through Benhamou Global Ventures) ($0.3 million),
Ms. Rodeno ($0.3 million) and Friedman (through his family trust) ($0.1
million. Mr. H.A. Schupf, a principal stockholder, is also a limited
partner of SICP ($0.5 million).

In 2000, we created SVB Qualified Investors Fund, LLC
(“QIF”), a $7.6 million investment fund for employees that met certain
eligibility requirements. To be eligible to participate in QIF, an employee
must be of a certain grade level and must be an “accredited investor,” as such
term is defined by the SEC. QIF was initially capitalized by commitments and
contributions from certain eligible employees including our senior management.
All employee participants are required to invest in this fund with their own
money, but we manage the fund and pay all administrative costs associated with
the fund. QIF’s principal purpose is to invest in a select number of private
equity funds managed primarily by us or our affiliates. The following individuals
who were executive officers in 2006 participated in QIF, each with individual
commitment amounts ranging between $0.1 million and $0.5 million: Messrs. Wilcox,
Becker, Jenkins-Stark, Kellogg, and Verissimo.

In 2005, we formed SVB Qualified Investors Fund II,
LLC (“QIF II”), a $5.1 million investment fund for employees that met certain
eligibility requirements similar to those of QIF. All employee participants are
required to invest in this fund with their own money, but we manage the fund
and pay all administrative costs associated with the fund. QIF II’s principal
purpose is to invest in a select number of private equity funds managed
primarily by us or our affiliates. The following individuals who were executive
officers in 2006 participated in QIF II, each with individual commitment
amounts ranging between $0.1 million and $0.3 million:  Messrs. Wilcox, Becker, Jenkins-Stark,
Kellogg, and Verissimo, and Ms. Ward Pierce.

In 2003, Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP, a venture
debt fund, and certain affiliated funds (the “Gold Hill Funds”) were created.
The total size of the Gold Hill Funds is approximately $214.1 million. We have
a majority interest in the general partner of the Gold Hill Funds, in addition
to being a limited partner in one of the Gold Hill Funds. Our combined
commitment total in the general partner and the Gold Hill Funds is $20.0
million. Certain of our directors are also limited partners of the Gold Hill
Funds and hold a minority interest: Mr. Hardymon (through his family
limited partnership) ($2.5 million) and Ms. Rodeno ($0.2 million).

In 2005, Partners for
Growth II, LP, a special situation debt fund (“PFG II”), was created. The total
size of PFG II is approximately $62.0 million. The general partner of PFG II is
not owned or controlled by us. Certain of our directors are also limited
partners in PFG II and hold a minority interest: Mr. Hardymon ($1.0
million) and Ms. Rodeno ($0.3 million).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,
Guarantees, and Other Commitments

In the normal course of
business, we use financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the
financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include
commitments to extend credit and commercial and standby letters of credit.
These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. Credit
risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties
to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the
contract.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Commitments to Extend Credit

A commitment to extend
credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no
violation of any condition established in the agreement. Such commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates, or other termination clauses, and
usually require a fee paid by the client upon us issuing the commitment.
Commitments which are available for funding, due to clients meeting all
collateral, compliance, and financial covenants required under loan commitment
agreements, totaled $4.1 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively. Out of these available commitment balances, fixed interest
rate commitments were $611.7 million and $325.5 million at December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. Commitments which are unavailable for funding, due
to clients not meeting all collateral, compliance, and financial covenants
required under loan commitment agreements, totaled $0.6 billion and $0.9
billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our potential
exposure to credit loss, in the event of nonperformance by the other party to
the financial instrument, is the contractual amount of the available unused
loan commitment. We use the same credit approval and monitoring process in
extending loan commitments as we do in making loans. The actual liquidity needs
or the credit risk that we have experienced have historically been lower than
the contractual amount of commitments to extend credit because a significant
portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. We evaluate each
potential borrower and the necessary collateral on an individual basis. The
type of collateral varies, but may include real property, intellectual
property, bank deposits, or business and personal assets. The potential credit
risk associated with these commitments is considered in management’s evaluation
of the adequacy of the liability for unfunded credit commitments. Additionally,
we had aggregate maximum lending limits of $468.1 million and $472.7
million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to our accounts
receivable factoring arrangements. We extend credit under accounts receivable
factoring arrangements when our clients’ sales invoices are deemed credit
worthy under existing underwriting practices.

Commercial and Standby Letters of Credits

Commercial and standby letters of credit represent
conditional commitments issued by us on behalf of a client to guarantee the
performance of the client to a third party when certain specified future events
have occurred. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily for inventory
purchases by a client and are typically short-term in nature. We provide two
types of standby letters of credit: performance and financial standby letters
of credit. Performance standby letters of credit are issued to guarantee the performance
of a client to a third party when certain specified future events have occurred
and are primarily used to support performance instruments such as bid bonds,
performance bonds, lease obligations, repayment of loans, and past due notices.
Financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to
guarantee the payment by a client to a third party (beneficiary) and are
primarily used to support many types of domestic and international payments.
These standby letters of credit have fixed expiration dates and generally
require a fee to be paid by the client at the time we issue the commitment.
Fees generated from these standby letters of credit are recognized in
noninterest income over the commitment period using the straight-line method.

The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit
is essentially the same as that involved with extending loan commitments to
clients, and accordingly, we use a credit evaluation process and collateral
requirements similar to those for loan commitments. Our standby letters of
credit often are cash secured by our clients. The actual liquidity needs or the
credit risk that we have experienced historically have been


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

lower than the contractual
amount of letters of credit issued because a significant portion of these
conditional commitments expire without being drawn upon.

The
table below summarizes our commercial and standby letters of credit at December 31,
2006. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the amount
that could be remitted under letters of credit if there were a total default by
the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under
recourse provisions or from the collateral held or pledged.

2006, collateral in the form of cash and investment securities available to us
to reimburse losses, if any, under financial and performance standby letters of
credits was $267.4 million.

Credit Card Guarantees

The Bank, as a financial
provider, routinely guarantees credit cards for some of our customers that have
been provided by an unaffiliated financial institution. The Bank has recourse
against the customer for any amount it is required to pay to a third party in
the event of default under these arrangements. These guarantees are subject to
the same credit policies, underwriting standards and approval process as loans
made by the Bank. Certain of these amounts are secured by certificates of
deposit and other assets, which the Bank has rights to in the event of
nonperformance by customers. The total amount of this guarantee was $72.6
million at December 31, 2006. It is not considered probable that material
losses would be incurred by the Bank as a result of these arrangements. Credit
card fees totaled $4.6 million, $3.7 million and $0.2 million for the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Commitments to Invest in Private Equity Funds

We
make commitments to invest in private equity funds, which in turn make investments
in privately held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally
made up to a ten-year period from the inception of the fund. The timing of
future cash requirements to fund such commitments is generally dependent upon
the investment cycle, overall market conditions, and the nature and type of
industry in which the privately held companies operate. The following table

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

SFAS No. 107,

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

(“SFAS
No. 107”), requires that we disclose estimated fair values for our
financial instruments. Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth
below for our financial instruments, are made solely to comply with the
requirements of SFAS No. 107.

Fair values are based on
estimates or calculations at the transaction level using present value
techniques in instances where quoted market prices are not available. Because
broadly traded markets do not exist for many of our financial instruments, the
fair value calculations attempt to incorporate the effect of current market
conditions at a specific time. Fair valuations are management’s estimates of
the values, and they are calculated based on current pricing policies, the
economic and competitive environment, the characteristics of the financial
instruments, expected losses, and other such factors. These calculations are
subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant
judgment, and do not include tax ramifications; therefore, the results cannot
be determined with precision or substantiated by comparison to independent
markets, and they may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement
of the instruments. There may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation
technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount
rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the
results. For all of these reasons, the aggregation of the fair value
calculations presented herein does not represent, and should not be construed
to represent, the underlying value of the Company.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The
following describes the methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair
values of financial instruments.

Short-term Financial Assets

Short-term financial
assets include cash on hand, cash balances due from banks, interest-earning
deposits, securities purchased under agreement to resell and other short-term
investment securities. The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair
value because of the insignificant risk of changes in value due to original or
purchased maturity dates of generally 90 days or less.

Investment Securities—Marketable

Marketable investment
securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, which is
based on quoted market prices provided by known and reputable pricing services
or dealer quotes.

Investment Securities—Non-Marketable

We record our wholly owned
non-marketable private equity fund investments and other private equity
investments on a cost basis less any identified other than temporary
impairment. For our direct equity venture funds, our funds of funds and our
consolidated venture debt fund, we record the non-marketable investments using
investment company fair value accounting rules.

Loans

The fair value of fixed
and variable rate loans is estimated by discounting contractual cash flows
using discount rates that reflect our current pricing for loans and the forward
yield curve.

Derivatives Financial Instruments

The fair values of
derivatives are presented in Note 14. Derivative Financial Instruments.

Other Assets and Other Liabilities

Other assets include foreign currency exchange contracts
purchased and other liabilities include foreign currency exchange contracts
sold, which are carried at fair value based on current currency exchange rates.

Deposits

The fair value of deposits
with no stated maturity, such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits,
interest-bearing checking accounts and money market accounts is equal to the
amount payable on demand at the measurement date. The fair value of time
deposits is estimated by discounting the balances using our cost of borrowings
and the forward yield curve over their remaining contractual term.

Short-term Borrowings

Short-term borrowings
include federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements
and FHLB advances. The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value
because of the relatively short time between the origination of the instrument
and its contractual maturity.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Long-term Borrowings

Long-term borrowings
include our contingently convertible debt, junior subordinated debentures and
other long-term debt (see Note 12. Borrowings). The fair value of long-term
borrowings is estimated based on quoted market prices for the issues for which
there is a market. Otherwise, the fair value of long-term borrowings is
calculated by discounting the contractual cash flows using the forward yield
curve over their remaining contractual term or a calculation based on the
market value of the underlying instrument, whichever is deemed more relevant.

Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments

The fair value of unfunded commitments to extend
credit is estimated based on the average amount we would receive or pay to
execute a new agreement with identical terms, considering current interest
rates and taking into account the remaining terms of the agreement and
counterparties’ credit standing.

Letters of credit are
carried at their fair value, which is equivalent to the residual premium or fee
at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Commitments to extend credit and letters of
credit typically result in loans with a market interest rate if funded.

Limitations

The information presented herein is based on pertinent
information available to us as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Although
management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the
estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively
revalued since the most recent year end, and the estimated fair values of these
financial instruments may have changed significantly since that point in time.

The
following table is a summary of the estimated fair values of our financial
instruments, excluding short-term financial assets and short-term borrowings,
for which carrying amounts approximate fair value, and for foreign currency
exchange contracts purchased and sold, marketable investment securities,
non-marketable investment securities accounted for under investment company
fair value accounting guidelines and derivative financial instruments, which
are carried at fair value at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Regulatory Matters

The Company and the Bank are subject to various
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the Federal Reserve
Board and the California Department of Financial Institutions (“DFI”). The
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”)
required that the federal regulatory agencies adopt regulations defining five
capital tiers for banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized,
undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically
undercapitalized. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate
certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators
that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our consolidated
financial statements.

Quantitative measures, established by the regulators
to ensure capital adequacy, require that the Company and the Bank maintain
minimum ratios (set forth in the table below) of capital to risk-weighted
assets. There are three categories of capital under the guidelines. Tier 1
capital includes common stockholders’ equity, qualifying preferred stock and
trust preferred securities, less goodwill and certain other deductions
(including the unrealized net gains and losses, after applicable taxes, on
securities available-for-sale carried at fair value). Tier 1 capital must
comprise at least half of total capital. Tier 2 capital includes preferred
stock not qualifying as Tier 1 capital, subordinated debt, the allowance for
credit losses and net unrealized gains on marketable equity securities, subject
to limitations by the guidelines. Tier 3 capital includes certain qualifying
unsecured subordinated debt.

Under these capital guidelines, the minimum total
risk-based capital ratio and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirements are ten
percent and six percent, respectively, of risk-weighted assets and certain
off-balance sheet items for a well-capitalized depository institution.

The Federal Reserve Board has also established minimum
capital leverage ratio guidelines for state member banks. The ratio is
determined using Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets. The
guidelines require a minimum of five percent for a well-capitalized depository

The most recent joint notification from the DFI and
the Federal Reserve Board categorized the Bank as well-capitalized, under the
FDICIA prompt corrective action provisions applicable to banks. There are no
conditions or events since that notification that management believes have
changed the Bank’s category.

Stockholders’ Rights Plan

Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) has approved and
adopted a stockholders’ rights plan to, among other things, protect our
stockholders from coercive takeover tactics. The current stockholders’ rights
plan in effect through January 31, 2008 (the “Rights Plan”) is attached as
Exhibits 4.20 and 4.13 to our amended and restated registration statement on Form 8-A/A,
filed with the SEC on February 27, 2004 and August 3, 2004,
respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

Under the Rights Plan, each stockholder of record on November 9,
1998 received a dividend of one right (a “Right”) for each outstanding share of
common stock of the Company. The Rights are attached to, and presently only
traded with, shares of the Company’s common stock and are not currently
exercisable. Except as specified below, upon becoming exercisable, each Right
will entitle the holder to purchase from us 1/1000th of a share of the Company’s
Series A Participating Preferred Stock at a price of $100.00 per share.

The Rights will be exercisable on the tenth (10

th

) business day (or such later
date as is determined by our Board) following the announcement that a person or
group (other than the Company, its subsidiaries or their employee benefit
plans) has acquired or announces a tender or exchange offer to acquire


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

beneficial ownership of
15% or more of the Company’s common stock. If a person or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company’s common stock, each Right
will then be exercisable for shares of common stock having a value equal to two
times the exercise price of the Right. Similarly, in the event the Company is
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more
of our consolidated assets or earning power are sold following such time as a
person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company’s
common stock, the rights will be exercisable for shares of the acquirer or its
parent having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right.

At any time on or prior to
the close of business on the earlier of (i) the fifth day following a
public announcement that a person or group (other than the Company, its
subsidiaries or their employee benefit plans) has acquired beneficial ownership
of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding common shares (or such later date
as may be determined by action of the Board and publicly announced) and (ii) January 31,
2008, we may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001
per Right, subject to adjustment.

Segment Reporting

SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information

(“SFAS No. 131”),
requires that we report certain financial and descriptive information about our
reportable operating segments, as well as related disclosures about products
and services, geographic areas and major customers. Our reportable operating
segments results are regularly reviewed internally by our chief operating
decision maker (“CODM”) when evaluating segment performance and deciding how to
allocate resources and in assessing performance.   Our
CODM is our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”).

For management reporting purposes, we offer clients
financial products and services through four primary strategic operating
groups:  Commercial Banking, SVB Capital,
SVB Alliant, and Other Business Services. Our Other Business Services group
includes SVB Global, SVB Private Client Services, SVB Analytics and certain
other business service units. Unlike financial reporting, which benefits from
the comprehensive structure provided by GAAP, the internal profitability
reporting process is highly subjective, as there is no comprehensive,
authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our management reporting
process measures the performance of our operating segments based on our
internal operating structure and is not necessarily comparable with similar
information for other financial services companies. In addition, changes in an
individual client’s primary relationship designation have resulted, and may in
the future result, in the inclusion of certain clients in different segments in
different periods. We have reclassified certain prior-period amounts to conform
to the current period’s presentation.

An operating segment is separately reportable if it
exceeds any one of several quantitative thresholds specified in SFAS
No. 131. Of our operating segments, only Commercial Banking, SVB Capital
and SVB Alliant were determined to be reportable segments as of
December 31, 2006. SVB Global, SVB Private Client Services, SVB Analytics
and certain other business service units did not meet the separate reporting
thresholds and as a result, in the table below, have been aggregated in a
column labeled “Other Business Services” for segment reporting purposes. The
Other Business Services column also reflects other business service units and
those adjustments necessary to reconcile the results of the operating segments
based on our internal profitability reporting process to the consolidated
financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP.

Our CODM allocates resources to and assesses the
performance of each operating segment based on net interest income, noninterest
income and noninterest expense, which are presented as components of


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

segment operating profit
or loss before income taxes. Net interest income, our primary source of
revenue, is reported, net of funds transfer pricing (“FTP”). FTP is an internal
measurement framework designed to assess the financial impact of a financial
institution’s sources and uses of funds. It is the mechanism by which an
earnings credit is given for deposits raised and an earnings charge is made for
funded loans. In addition, we evaluate assets based on average balances;
therefore, period-end asset balances are not presented for segment reporting
purposes. We have not reached reportable levels of revenue, net income or
assets outside the United States and as such we do not present geographic
segment information.

Our
Commercial Banking Business Group

,

referred to as SVB
Silicon Valley Bank, includes the Bank and its subsidiaries. Through this segment,
we serve clients in all stages of maturity ranging from emerging-growth
companies to established, private and public companies in the technology, life
sciences and premium wine industries. We define “emerging-growth” clients as
companies in the start-up or early stages of their life cycles. These companies
tend to be privately held and backed by venture capital; they generally have
few employees, are primarily engaged in research and development, have brought
relatively few products or services to market and have little or no revenues.
By contrast, we define “established” or “middle-market” clients as companies
that tend to be more mature. These companies may be publicly traded and are
more established in the markets in which they participate.

SVB Capital

focuses on the
business needs of our private equity clients, with whom we have established and
maintain relationships domestically and internationally. Through this segment,
we provide banking services and financial solutions, including traditional deposit
and checking accounts, loans, letters of credit and cash management services to
private equity clients. SVB Capital also makes investments in private equity
firms and in companies in the niches we serve. The group manages five private
equity funds and oversees investments, including our investments in several
sponsored limited partnerships. These limited partnerships include Gold Hill
Venture Lending 03, LP and its parallel funds, which primarily provide secured
debt, typically to emerging-growth clients in their earliest stages; and the
Partners for Growth funds, which are special situation debt funds that provide
secured debt primarily to higher-risk, more established middle-market clients
in their later stages.

SVB
Alliant,

our investment banking subsidiary,
principally provides merger and acquisition advisory services (“M&A”),
private placement advisory services and fairness opinions. SVB Alliant is a
broker-dealer registered with the SEC and a member of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD”). In 2005, we established SVB Alliant
Europe Limited, a subsidiary of SVB Financial Group based in London, England,
in order to provide investment advisory services to companies in Europe. SVB
Alliant Europe Limited commenced full operations on May 2, 2006, when it
received its license from the Financial Services Authority, an independent body
that regulates the financial services industry in the United Kingdom.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Other Business Services

includes
SVB Global, SVB Private Client Services, SVB Analytics and other business
service units that are not part of one of the three business groups described
above. SVB Global includes three foreign subsidiaries, which facilitate our
clients’ global expansion into major technology centers around the world. SVB
Global provides a variety of services, including consulting and business
services, referrals, and knowledge sharing, as well as identifying business
opportunities for us. SVB Private Client Services provides a wide range of
credit services to high-net-worth individuals using both long-term secured and
short-term unsecured lines of credit. SVB Private Client Services helps our
clients meet their cash management needs by providing deposit account products
and services, including checking accounts, deposit accounts, money market
accounts, and certificates of deposit. SVB Analytics, a new entity formed in
2006, provides solutions to address the valuation needs of private emerging-growth
technology and life sciences companies. SVB Analytics includes eProsper, a
company that provides equity ownership data management services. SVB Analytics
acquired a controlling interest in eProsper in August 2006.

a $5.0 million and $0.6 million net


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

loan charge-off for the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively, and a $12.4 million net loan recovery for the year
ended December 31, 2004,  which
represents the difference between net loan charge-offs and the provision for
loan losses.

(2)

Noninterest
income presented in the Commercial Banking segment includes warrant income of
$10.5 million, $11.6 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

(3)

The
Commercial Banking segment includes direct depreciation and amortization of
$3.2 million, $2.0 million, and $1.6 million for the years ended 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. Due to the complexity of our cost allocation model, it is
not feasible to determine the exact amount of the remaining depreciation and
amortization expense allocated to the various business segments (totaling
approximately $6.2 million, $5.7 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively).

The
internal reporting model used by management to assess segment performance does
not calculate tax expense by segment. Our effective tax rate is a reasonable
approximation of the segment rates.

equals the greater of total loans or the sum of total deposits and total

stock in connection with providing credit facilities and less frequently for
certain other business services. The parent purchases all equity warrant assets
from the Bank at grant date fair value (See Note 2. Summary of Significant

SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)

27.

Legal
Matters

Certain lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary
course of business have been filed or are pending against us or our affiliates.
Based upon information available to us, our review of such claims to date and
consultation with our outside legal counsel, management believes the liability
relating to these actions, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on
our liquidity, consolidated financial position, or results of operations. Where
appropriate, as we determine, reserves have been established in accordance with
SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

. The
outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently
uncertain, however, and it is possible that one or more of the legal or
regulatory matters currently pending or threatened could have a material
adverse effect.

On May 24, 2001, Gateway
Communications, Inc. (Gateway) filed a lawsuit in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Western Division) naming
the Bank as a defendant. Gateway (the debtor in the bankruptcy case) alleged
that the Bank’s actions in connection with a loan resulted in Gateway’s
bankruptcy, and sought $20 million in compensatory damages, punitive damages,
interest and attorneys’ fees. On June 24, 2003, the Court dismissed four
of the five counts in the complaint, including the claim for punitive damages,
leaving one breach of contract claim. The matter was settled in its entirety in
October 2006 for an amount previously accrued for in our financial
statements.


Item 9.

Changes
in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A.

Controls and
Procedures

(a)

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls
and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, among
other processes, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

The Company carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2006 pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15b.
Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of December 31, 2006.

(b)

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting at the Company.
Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the
supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable
detail, transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets, (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of
management and the directors of the company, and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect
on the company’s financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving
financial reporting objectives. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company carried out
an assessment, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15(c), as adopted by the SEC under
the Exchange Act. In evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting, management used the framework established in “Internal
Control—Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this assessment,
management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective.


KPMG LLP, the independent
registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the consolidated
financial statements of the Company, has issued a report on management’s
assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006. The report expresses unqualified opinions on management’s
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006.

(c)

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Except as described below,
there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
identified in management’s evaluation during the fourth quarter of the period
covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

(d)

Remediation of Material Weaknesses

Management assessed our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. As previously disclosed in
the 2005 Form 10-K report, filed on March 27, 2006, as a result
of this assessment, management concluded that the Company did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005.

A material weakness
is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results
in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The material weaknesses
identified by management as of December 31, 2005 included the following:

·

The
Company did not have adequately designed internal controls in its financial
reporting process related to the selection and application of GAAP.
Specifically, accounting policies, procedures and practices were not
consistently developed, maintained or updated in a manner ensuring that
financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Also, policies and
procedures were not designed to consistently ensure the preparation and
retention of adequate documentation to support key judgments made in connection
with the selection and application of significant accounting policies within
the Company’s financial reporting process. Finally, the Company’s policies and
procedures did not consistently provide for effective analysis, implementation,
and documentation of new accounting pronouncements.

·

The
Company did not maintain sufficient levels of appropriately qualified and
trained personnel in its financial reporting processes. As a result, the
Company did not establish effective internal control over financial reporting
policies and procedures related to (a) the timely preparation of
comprehensive documentation supporting management’s analysis of the appropriate
accounting treatment for equity warrant assets or other non-routine or complex
transactions, and (b) the review of such documentation by qualified
internal staff, assisted by external advisors as deemed necessary, to determine
its completeness and the propriety of the Company’s conclusions.

For additional information relating to the control
deficiencies that resulted in the material weaknesses described above, please
see the discussion under “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures” and “Item 4.
Controls and Procedures” contained in our reports on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2005 and Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2006, respectively.

During 2006, we
implemented a number of remediation measures to address the material weaknesses
described above. The corrective measures implemented during 2006 are as
follows:

·

Redesigned
and expanded the Accounting & Financial Reporting Department’s
organizational structure to ensure focused expertise, manageable workloads and
adequate communication;


·

Hiring
additional accounting personnel to ensure that accounting personnel with
adequate experience, skills and knowledge, particularly in relation to complex
or non-routine transactions, are directly involved in the review and accounting
evaluation of such transactions;

·

Established
a derivatives team, which focuses on the tracking and accounting of derivative
instruments, particularly equity warrant assets;

·

Involving
internal personnel assisted by external advisors, as deemed necessary, early in
the process, particularly in complex or non-routine transactions, to obtain
additional guidance as to the application of GAAP to any such proposed
transactions;

·

Ensuring
comprehensive documentation supporting management’s analysis of the appropriate
accounting treatment for equity warrant assets or other non-routine or complex
transactions and the related review thereof are completed to standards
established by senior accounting personnel and the principal accounting
officer;

·

Requiring
senior accounting personnel and the principal accounting officer to review all
complex or non-routine transactions to evaluate and approve the accounting
treatment for such transactions;

·

Established
process and procedure to track, evaluate and communicate new and proposed
changes in GAAP and SEC pronouncements;

·

Requiring
regular periodic review of critical and significant accounting policies and
their adoption, application, and impact by senior accounting personnel and the
principal accounting officer; and

·

Documenting
processes and procedures, along with appropriate training, to ensure that the
Company’s accounting policies, which have been corrected to conform with GAAP,
are consistently applied going forward.

Based on the above and the
hiring of additional accounting staff with the required depths, skills and
technical expertise to prepare the Company’s financial statements and
disclosures in accordance with GAAP, along with enhancements to its processes
for accounting for equity warrant assets and other non-routine or complex
transactions, developing and maintaining comprehensive accounting policies and
improved processes for the documentation and review of significant accounting
entries, management has concluded that the material weaknesses described in the
2005 Form 10-K report no longer existed as of December 31,
2006.
