ITEM 1.   B

USINESS

General

Silicon Valley Bancshares is a bank holding company
and a financial holding company that was incorporated in the state of Delaware
in March 1999. Our principal subsidiary, Silicon Valley Bank, is a
California state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve
System. Silicon Valley Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. Our corporate headquarters is located at 3003 Tasman
Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054 and our telephone number is 408.654.7400.
When we refer to “Silicon Valley Bancshares” or “we” or use similar words, we
intend to include Silicon Valley Bancshares and all of its subsidiaries
collectively, including Silicon Valley Bank. When we refer to “Bancshares,” we
are referring only to the parent company, Silicon Valley Bancshares.

For over 20 years, we have been dedicated to helping
entrepreneurs succeed, specifically focusing on industries where we have deep
knowledge and relationships. Our focus is on the technology, life science,
private equity, and premium wine industries. We continue to diversify our
products and services to support our clients throughout their life cycles,
regardless of their age or size. We offer a range of financial services that
generate three distinct sources of income.

In part, our income is generated from interest rate
differentials. The difference between the interest rates paid by us on
interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the
interest rates received on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to
clients and securities held in our investment portfolio, accounts for the major
portion of our earnings. Our deposits are largely obtained from commercial
clients within our technology, life science, private equity, and premium wine
industry sectors, and, to a lesser extent, from individuals served by our
Private Client Services group. We do not obtain deposits from conventional
retail sources and have no brokered deposits. As part of negotiated credit
facilities and certain other services, we frequently obtain rights to acquire
stock in the form of warrants in certain client companies.

Fee-based services also generate income for our
business. We market our full range of financial services to all of our
commercial and private equity firm clients. In addition to commercial banking
and private client services, we offer fee-based merger and acquisition
services, private placements, and investment and advisory services. Our ability
to integrate and cross-sell our diverse financial services to our clients is a
strength of our business model.

In addition, we seek to obtain equity returns through
investments in direct equity and venture capital fund investments. We manage
three limited partnerships: a venture capital fund that invests directly in
privately-held companies and two funds that invest in other venture capital
funds.

We are able to offer our
clients financial products and services through four lines of banking and
financial services, as discussed in further detail below: Commercial Banking,
SVB Capital, SVB Alliant, and Private Client Services and Other Services. These
operating segments are strategic units that offer different services to
different clients. They are managed separately because each segment appeals to
different markets and, accordingly, require different strategies.


Business Overview

Silicon Valley Bancshares
is organized into groups, which manage the diverse financial services we offer:

Commercial Banking

We provide solutions to the needs of our commercial
clients in the technology, life science, private equity and premium wine
industries through our lending, deposit account and cash management, and global
banking and trade products and services.

Through our lending
products and services, we extend loans and other credit facilities to our
commercial clients, most often secured by the assets of our clients. Lending
products and services include traditional term loans, equipment loans,
revolving lines of credit, accounts-receivable based lines of credit, asset-based
loans, real estate loans, vineyard development loans, and financing of
affordable housing projects. We often obtain warrants to purchase an equity
position in a client company’s stock in consideration for making loans, or for
providing other services.

Our deposit account and
cash management products and services provide commercial clients with short and
long-term cash management solutions. Deposit account products and services
include traditional deposit and checking accounts, certificates of deposit, and
money market accounts. In connection with deposit accounts, we also provide
lockbox and merchant services that facilitate quicker depositing of checks and
other payments to clients’ accounts. Cash management products and services
include wire transfer and Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment services to
enable clients to transfer funds quickly from their deposit accounts.
Additionally, the cash management services unit provides collection services,
disbursement services, electronic funds transfers, and online banking through
SVBeConnect.

Our global banking and
trade products and services facilitate our clients’ global finance and business
needs. These products and services include foreign exchange services that allow
commercial clients to manage their foreign currency risks through the purchase
and sale of currencies on the global inter-bank market. To facilitate our
clients’ international trade, we offer a variety of loans and credit facilities
guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States. We also offer
letters of credit, including export, import, and standby letters of credit, to
enable clients to ship and receive goods globally.

In 2004, Silicon Valley
Bank established SVB Europe Advisors, Limited, a subsidiary in the United
Kingdom that provides consulting and business services and access to financial
services of Silicon Valley Bank to Europe based clients and prospects in the
niches Silicon Valley Bank serves. In 2004, Silicon Valley Bank also
established SVB India Advisors Pvt. Ltd., a subsidiary in Bangalore, India that
provides consulting and business services to facilitate U.S.-based and Indian
technology companies and private equity firms pursuing international business. SVB
India Advisors provides services such as educational information, introductions
to recommended service providers (lawyers, accountants, real estate brokers,
etc.), networking events, and technical and concierge services for commercial
and venture fund clients visiting India.

The Commercial Banking
group also provides investment and advisory services to our clients through our
broker-dealer subsidiary, SVB Securities (formerly known as SVB Securities, Inc.).
These services, which include mutual funds, fixed income securities and
repurchase agreements enable our clients to better manage their assets. We also
offer investment advisory services through SVB Asset Management, one of our
registered investment advisor subsidiaries. SVB Asset Management specializes in
outsourced treasury management, customized cash portfolio management and
reporting and monitoring for corporations.


SVB Capital

SVB Capital (formerly referred to as our Merchant
Banking group) focuses on the business needs of our venture capital and private
equity clients, establishing and maintaining relationships with those firms
domestically and internationally. Through this segment, we provide banking
services and financial solutions, including traditional deposit and checking
accounts, loans, letters of credit, and cash management services.

SVB Capital also makes investments in venture capital
and other private equity firms and in companies in the niches we serve. The
segment also manages three venture funds that are consolidated into our
financial statements: SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP and SVB Strategic
Investors Fund II, LP, which are funds of funds that invest in other venture
funds, and Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP, a direct equity venture fund that
invests in privately held technology and life-science companies. This segment
also includes 2004 investments in Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners 03, LP and
its parallel funds (collectively known as Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners
03. LP), which  provide secured debt to
emerging growth clients in their earliest stages, and Partners for Growth, LP,
a fund that provides secured debt to higher risk, emerging growth clients in
their later stages. We define “emerging-growth” clients as companies in the
start-up or early stages of their lifecycle. These companies tend to be
privately held and backed by venture capital; they generally have few
employees, have brought relatively few products or services to market, and have
no or little revenue. By contrast, “middle market companies” tend to be more
mature; they may be publicly traded and more established in the markets in
which they participate, although not necessarily the leading players in the
largest industries.

SVB Capital, through
Private Equities Services (a division of SVB Securities), also assists private
equity firms, and the partners of such firms, with liquidating securities
following initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions, including
in-kind stock transactions, restricted stock sales, block trading, and special
situations trading such as liquidation of foreign securities.

SVB Alliant

Through SVB Alliant
(formerly known as Alliant Partners), our investment banking subsidiary, we
provide merger and acquisition advisory services (M&A), strategic alliance
services, and specialized financial studies such as valuations and fairness opinions.
In October 2003, we enhanced our investment banking product set by
launching a Private Capital Group that provides advisory services for the
private placement of securities. SVB Alliant is a broker-dealer registered with
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD).

Private Client Services and Other

Our Private Client
Services and Other group is principally comprised of our Private Client
Services group and other business services units. Private Client Services
(formerly Private Banking) provides a wide range of credit services to
high-net-worth individuals using both long-term secured and short-term
unsecured lines of credit. Those products and services include home equity
lines of credit, secured lines of credit, restricted stock purchase loans,
airplane loans, and capital call lines of credit. We also help our clients meet
their cash management needs by providing deposit account products and services,
including checking accounts, deposit accounts, money market accounts, and
certificates of deposit. Through our subsidiary, Woodside Asset Management, Inc.,
we provide individual clients with personal investment advisory services,
assisting clients in establishing and implementing investment strategies to
meet their individual needs and goals.

Industry Niches

In each of the industry
niches we serve, we have developed services to meet the needs of our clients
throughout their life cycles, from early stage through maturity.


Technology and Life
Science

We serve a variety of clients in the technology and
life science industries. A key component of our technology and life science
business strategy is to develop relationships with clients at an early stage
and offer them banking services that will continue to meet their needs as they
mature and expand.

Our early stage clients generally keep large cash
balances in their deposit accounts and usually do not borrow large amounts
under their credit facilities. The primary source of funding for most early
stage clients is equity from venture capitalists and public markets. Lending to
this market typically involves working capital lines of credit, equipment
financing, asset acquisition loans, and bridge financing between funding
rounds.

With an extended suite of financial services, we have
expanded our business to more mature companies. Our corporate technology
practice is a network of senior lenders focused primarily on the specific
financial needs of more mature private and public clients. When we refer to “corporate
technology,” we are referring to companies that tend to be more mature, better
capitalized, possibly publicly traded and more established in the markets in
which they participate. Today, we can comfortably address the financial needs
of all companies in our niches, whether they are entrepreneurs with innovative
ideas or multinational corporations with hundreds of millions of dollars in
sales.

Our technology and
life science clients generally fall into the following industries:

·

Hardware:
Semiconductors, Communications, and Electronics

·

Software:
Software and Services

·

Biotechnology

·

Drug
Discovery

·

Medical
Devices

·

Specialty Pharmaceuticals

Private Equity

Through our SVB Capital
group, we have cultivated strong relationships with venture capital firms
worldwide, many of which are also clients. SVB Capital provides financial
services to a significant portion of the venture capital firms in the United
States as well as to other private equity firms, facilitating deal flow to and
from these private equity firms and participating in direct investments in
their portfolio companies.

Premium Wine

Our premium wine practice
has become one of the leading providers of financial services to the U.S.
premium wine industry. We focus on vineyards and wineries that produce grapes
and wines of the highest quality.

Industry Niches
Exited

In keeping with our strategic focus on the technology,
life science, private equity, and premium wine industries, we exited three
niches in late 2002: real estate, media, and religious lending. While we will
continue to service our existing real estate, media, and religious niche loans
until they are paid-off, we expect our refined strategic focus on more
profitable aspects of our core business will help improve overall
profitability.


For further information on
our business segments, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 24 Segment Reporting.

Business Combinations

On October 1, 2002, we acquired substantially all
of the assets of Woodside Asset Management, Inc., an investment advisor
firm, which had approximately $200 million under management for 70 clients. We
offer Woodside Asset Management’s services as part of our Private Client
Services. Additionally, as part of this acquisition, Silicon Valley Bancshares
obtained the general partner interests in two limited partnerships: Taurus
Growth Partners, LP and Libra Partners, LP. Both of these funds were liquidated
and funds were fully disbursed to the limited partners by December 31,
2004. We had less than a 1% ownership interest in each of these funds. The
remaining ownership interest represented limited partners’ funds invested on
their behalf by the general partner in certain fixed income and marketable
equity securities. However, due to our ability to control the investing
activities of these limited partnerships, we were required to consolidate the
related results of operations and financial condition into our consolidated
financial statements for all periods presented.

On September 28,
2001, SVB Securities, a subsidiary of Silicon Valley Bank, completed the
acquisition of SVB Alliant, an investment banking firm providing merger and
acquisition and corporate partnering services. Our investment banking business
continues to do business under the name “SVB Alliant.” See Item 8.
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 3 Business
Combinations. On October 1, 2002, SVB Alliant was sold from our Silicon
Valley Bank subsidiary to the Silicon Valley Bancshares parent company. This
transfer allowed SVB Alliant (formerly Alliant Partners) to operate under less
restrictive bank holding company regulations and increased our capital ratios
at Silicon Valley Bank.

Competition

The banking and financial
services industry is highly competitive, and evolves as a result of changes in
regulation, technology, product delivery systems, and the general market and
economic climate. Our current competitors include other banks and specialty and
diversified financial services companies that offer lending, leasing, other
financial products, and advisory services to our target client base. The
principal competitive factors in our markets include product offerings,
service, and pricing. Given our established market position with the client
segments that we serve, we believe we compete favorably in all our markets in
these areas.

Employees

As of December 31,
2004, we employed approximately 1,028 full-time equivalent employees. To
our knowledge, none of our employees are represented by a labor union. Competition
for qualified personnel in our industry is significant, particularly for client
relationship manager positions, officers, and employees with strong
relationships with the venture capital community. Our future success will
depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified
personnel.

Supervision and Regulation

General

Our operations are subject
to extensive regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies. As a bank
holding company, Silicon Valley Bancshares is subject to the Federal Reserve
Board’s supervision, regulation, examination and reporting requirements under
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act). Silicon Valley Bancshares has
also qualified and elected to be treated as a financial holding company under
the BHC Act. Silicon Valley Bank, as a California-chartered bank and a
member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to primary supervision and
examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of San


Francisco
and the California Department of Financial Institutions. Both Silicon Valley
Bancshares and Silicon Valley Bank are required to file periodic reports with
these regulators and provide any additional information that they may require.
The following summary describes some of the more significant laws, regulations,
and policies that affect our operations and is not intended to be a complete
listing of all laws that apply to us. Any change in the statutes, regulations,
or policies that apply to our operations may have a material effect on our
business.

Regulation of
Holding Company

The Federal Reserve Board requires Silicon Valley
Bancshares to maintain minimum capital ratios, as discussed below in Regulatory
Capital. Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is also
required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its
subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound
manner. In addition, it is the Federal Reserve Board’s policy that in serving
as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should
stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its
subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should
maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain
additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company’s
failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its
subsidiary banks or to observe established guidelines with respect to the
payment of dividends by bank holding companies will generally be considered by
the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice, a
violation of the Federal Reserve Board’s regulations, or both.

Prior to becoming a financial holding company,
Bancshares was required under the BHC Act to seek the prior approval of the
Federal Reserve Board before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control
of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities, or
substantially all of the assets, of any bank, bank holding company, or nonbank
company. In addition, prior to becoming a financial holding company, Bancshares
was generally limited under the BHC Act to engaging, directly or indirectly,
only in the business of banking or managing or controlling banks and other
activities that were deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely
related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB
Act) amended the BHC Act to permit a qualifying bank holding company, called a
financial holding company, to engage in a broader range of activities than
those traditionally permissible for bank holding companies. A financial holding
company may conduct activities that are “financial in nature,” including
insurance, securities underwriting and dealing and market-making, and merchant
banking activities, as well as additional activities that the Federal Reserve
Board determines (in the case of incidental activities, in conjunction with the
Treasury Department) are incidental or complementary to financial activities,
without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. The GLB Act also
permits financial holding companies to acquire companies engaged in activities
that are financial in nature or that are incidental or complementary to
financial activities without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
The GLB Act also repealed the provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act that
restricted banks and securities firms from affiliating. On November 14,
2000, Silicon Valley Bancshares became a financial holding company. As a
financial holding company, Silicon Valley Bancshares no longer requires the
prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to conduct, or to acquire ownership
or control of entities engaged in, activities that are financial in nature or
activities that are determined to be incidental or complementary to financial
activities, although the requirement in the BHC Act for prior Federal Reserve
Board approval for the acquisition by a bank holding company of more than 5% of
any class of the voting shares of a bank or savings association (or the holding
company of either) is still applicable. Additionally, under the merchant
banking authority added by the GLB Act, Bancshares may invest in companies that
engage in activities that are not otherwise permissible, subject to certain limitations,
including that Bancshares make the investment with the intention of limiting
the investment in duration and does not manage the company on a day-to-day
basis.


To qualify as a financial holding company, a bank
holding company’s subsidiary depository institutions must be well capitalized
(as discussed below in “Regulatory Capital”) and have at least “satisfactory”
composite, managerial and Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) examination
ratings. A bank holding company that does not satisfy the criteria for
financial holding company status is limited to activities that were permissible
under the BHC Act prior to the enactment of the GLB Act. A financial holding
company that does not continue to meet all of the requirements for financial
holding company status will, depending upon which requirements it fails to
meet, lose the ability to undertake new activities or acquisitions that are not
generally permissible for bank holding companies or to continue such
activities.

Silicon Valley Bancshares
is also treated as a bank holding company under the California Financial Code.
As such, Silicon Valley Bancshares and its subsidiaries are subject to periodic
examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the California
Department of Financial Institutions.

Regulatory Capital

The federal banking agencies have adopted minimum risk-based
capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks intended to provide a
measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking
organization’s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet
as assets and those recorded as off-balance sheet items. These
off-balance sheet items include transactions such as commitments, letters of
credit, and recourse arrangements. Under these guidelines, dollar amounts of
assets and credit-equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are
adjusted by one of several conversion factors and/or risk adjustment
percentages. The Federal Reserve Board requires bank holding companies and
state member banks generally to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total
capital to risk-adjusted assets of 8% (10% to be well capitalized). At
least half of total capital must consist of items such as common stock,
retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, minority interests
(including trust preferred securities) and, for bank holding companies, a
limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less most
intangibles including goodwill (“Tier 1 capital”). The remainder (“Tier 2
capital”) may consist of other preferred stock, certain other instruments, and
limited amounts of subordinated debt and the loan and lease allowance. Not more
than 25% of qualifying Tier 1 capital may consist of trust preferred
securities. In order to be well capitalized, a bank holding company must have a
minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets of 6%. The
Federal Reserve Board also requires Bancshares and Silicon Valley Bank to
maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to total average assets, referred
to as the Tier 1 leverage ratio. For a bank holding company or a bank that
meets certain specified criteria, including those in the highest of the five
categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations, the minimum
Tier 1 leverage ratio is 3%. All other institutions are required to
maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 3% plus an additional cushion of
100 to 200 basis points (or at least 5% to be well capitalized). In addition to
these requirements, the Federal Reserve Board may set individual minimum
capital requirements for specific institutions at rates substantially above the
minimum guidelines and ratios. Under certain circumstances, Silicon Valley
Bancshares must file written notice with, and obtain approval from, the Federal
Reserve Board prior to purchasing or redeeming its equity securities. See
Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Prompt Corrective Action and
Other Enforcement Mechanisms for additional discussion of capital ratios.

The ability of Silicon Valley Bancshares, like other
bank holding companies, to continue to include its outstanding trust preferred
securities in Tier 1 capital has been made the subject of some doubt due to the
issuance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in January 2003
of Interpretation No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
(VIE),” and in May 2003 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,” although the Federal Reserve
Board announced in July 2003 that qualifying trust preferred securities
will continue to be treated as Tier 1 capital until notice is given to the
contrary.


Silicon Valley Bancshares and Silicon Valley Bank are
also subject to rules that govern the regulatory capital treatment of
equity investments in nonfinancial companies made on or after March 13,
2000 and held under certain specified legal authorities by a bank or bank
holding company. Silicon Valley Bank does not currently hold any such equity
investments. Under the rules, these equity investments will be subject to a
separate capital charge that will reduce a bank holding company’s Tier 1
capital and, correspondingly, will remove these assets from being taken into
consideration in establishing a bank holding company’s required capital ratios
discussed above.

The rules provide for the following incremental
Tier 1 capital charges: 8% of the adjusted carrying value of the portion
of such aggregate investments that are up to 15% of Tier 1 capital; 12% of
the adjusted carrying value of the portion of such aggregate investments that
are between 15% and 25% of Tier 1 capital; and 25% of the adjusted
carrying value of the portion of such aggregate investments that exceed 25% of
Tier 1 capital. The rules normally do not apply to unexercised
warrants acquired by a bank for making a loan or to equity securities that are
acquired in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted and that are held and
divested in accordance with applicable law.

The federal banking agencies have also adopted a joint
agency policy statement which provides that the adequacy and effectiveness of a
bank’s interest rate risk management process and the level of its interest rate
exposures are critical factors in the evaluation of the bank’s capital
adequacy. A bank with material weaknesses in its interest rate risk management
process or high levels of interest rate exposure relative to its capital will
be directed by the federal banking agencies to take corrective actions.
Financial institutions that have substantial amounts of their assets
concentrated in high-risk loans or nontraditional banking activities and
who fail to adequately manage these risks may be required to set aside capital
in excess of the regulatory minimums.

The capital ratios of
Silicon Valley Bancshares and Silicon Valley Bank, respectively, exceeded the
well-capitalized requirements, as defined above, at December 31,
2004. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data—Note 22. Regulatory Matters for the capital ratios of Silicon Valley
Bancshares and Silicon Valley Bank as of December 31, 2004.

Regulation of
Silicon Valley Bank

Silicon Valley Bank is a California-chartered bank and
a member of the Federal Reserve System. Silicon Valley Bank is subject to
primary supervision, periodic examination and regulation by the California
Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Board. If, as a
result of an examination of Silicon Valley Bank, the Federal Reserve Board should
determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality,
earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of Silicon Valley
Bank’s operations are unsatisfactory or that Silicon Valley Bank or its
management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, various remedies
are available to the Federal Reserve Board. Such remedies include the power to
enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative action to correct
any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an
administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in
capital, to restrict the growth of Silicon Valley Bank, to assess civil
monetary penalties, to remove officers and directors, and ultimately to
terminate Silicon Valley Bank’s deposit insurance, which for a
California-chartered bank would result in a revocation of Silicon Valley Bank’s
charter. The California Department of Financial Institutions has many of the
same remedial powers. Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of
the State of California and the United States affect the operations of Silicon
Valley Bank. State and federal statues and regulations relate to many aspects
of Silicon Valley Bank’s operations, including reserves against deposits,
ownership of deposit accounts, interest rates payable on deposits, loans,
investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends, locations of
branch offices, and capital requirements. Further, Silicon Valley Bank is
required to maintain certain levels of capital. See Regulatory Capital above.


The GLB Act changed the
powers of national banks and their subsidiaries, and made similar changes in
the powers of state bank subsidiaries. The GLB Act permits a national bank to
underwrite, deal in, and purchase state and local revenue bonds. It also allows
a subsidiary of a national bank to engage in financial activities that the bank
cannot, except for general insurance underwriting and real estate development
and investment. In order for a subsidiary to engage in new financial
activities, the national bank and its depository institution affiliates must be
well capitalized; have at least “satisfactory” general, managerial, and CRA
examination ratings; and meet other qualification requirements relating to
total assets, subordinated debt, capital, risk management, and affiliate
transactions. Subsidiaries of state banks can exercise the same powers as
national bank subsidiaries if they satisfy the same qualifying rules that
apply to national banks. For state banks that are members of the Federal
Reserve System like Silicon Valley Bank, prior approval of the Federal Reserve
Board is required before a bank can create a subsidiary to capitalize on the
additional financial activities empowered by the GLB Act.

Restrictions on
Dividends

Bancshares’ ability to pay
cash dividends is limited by generally applicable Delaware corporation law
limits. In addition, Bancshares is a legal entity separate and distinct from
Silicon Valley Bank, and there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the
amount of dividends that may be paid to Bancshares by Silicon Valley Bank. During
2004, 2003, and 2002, Silicon Valley Bank paid dividends of $25.0 million,
$51.0 million, and $80.0 million, respectively, to Bancshares. However, a part
of the dividend paid in 2003 and the dividend paid in 2004 were in excess of
the amount permitted under the California State Department of Financial
Institutions (“DFI”) guidelines. Therefore Bancshares has been required by the
DFI to return to Silicon Valley Bank a portion the 2003 dividend and the 2004
dividend—the total amount returned totaled $28.4 million. At this time, Silicon
Valley Bank must obtain prior approval from the DFI before paying any further
dividends to Bancshares. The Federal Reserve Board and the California
Commissioner of Financial Institutions (the Commissioner) have the authority to
prohibit Silicon Valley Bank from engaging in activities that, in their
opinion, constitute unsafe or unsound practices in conducting its business.
Depending upon the financial condition of Silicon Valley Bank and other
factors, the regulators could assert that the payment of dividends or other
payments might, under some circumstances, be an unsafe or unsound practice. If
Silicon Valley Bank fails to comply with its minimum capital requirements, its
regulators could restrict its ability to pay dividends using prompt corrective
action or other enforcement powers. The Commissioner may impose similar
limitations on the conduct of California-chartered banks. See
Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data—Note 22. Regulatory Matters for further discussion on dividend
restrictions.

Transactions with
Affiliates

Transactions between
Silicon Valley Bank and its operating subsidiaries, on the one hand, and their
affiliates, on the other, are subject to restrictions imposed by federal and
state law. These restrictions prevent Bancshares and other affiliates from
borrowing from, or entering into other credit transactions with, Silicon Valley
Bank or its operating subsidiaries unless the loans or other credit
transactions are secured by specified amounts of collateral. All such loans and
credit transactions and other “covered transactions” by Silicon Valley Bank and
its operating subsidiaries with any one affiliate are limited, in the
aggregate, to 10% of Silicon Valley Bank’s capital and surplus; and all such
loans and credit transactions and other “covered transactions” by Silicon
Valley Bank and its operating subsidiaries with all affiliates are limited, in
the aggregate, to 20% of Silicon Valley Bank’s capital and surplus. For this
purpose, a “covered transaction” generally includes, among other things, a loan
or extension of credit to an affiliate, a purchase of or investment in
securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets from an affiliate, the
acceptance of a security issued by an affiliate as collateral for an extension
of credit to any borrower, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or
letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. A company that is a direct or
indirect subsidiary of Silicon Valley Bank would not be considered to be an “affiliate”
of Silicon Valley Bank or its


operating
subsidiaries unless it fell into one of certain categories, such as a “financial
subsidiary” authorized under the GLB Act. In addition, Silicon Valley Bank and
its operating subsidiaries generally may not purchase a low-quality asset from
an affiliate, and covered transactions and other specified transactions by
Silicon Valley Bank and its operating subsidiaries with an affiliate must be on
terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
Also, Silicon Valley Bank and its operating subsidiaries generally may engage
in transactions with affiliates only on terms and under circumstances,
including credit standards, that are substantially the same, or at least as
favorable to the Bank or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.

Prompt Corrective
Action and Other Enforcement Mechanisms

Federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take
corrective and other supervisory action on an insured bank and its holding
company. Federal laws require each federal banking agency to take prompt
corrective action to resolve the problems of insured banks. Each federal banking
agency has issued regulations defining five categories in which an insured
depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital
ratios: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,
significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.

Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is
classified as well capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may
be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the
appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing,
determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound
practice, warrants such treatment. At each successive lower-capital
category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions, including
restrictions on the bank’s activities, operational practices or the ability to
pay dividends. However, the federal banking agencies may not treat an
institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratios actually
warrant such treatment.

In addition to measures
taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, bank holding companies and
insured banks may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal
regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for
violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the
agency or term of a written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may
include the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank; the issuance
of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the termination of
the bank’s deposit insurance; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the
issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal
agreements; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers,
directors, and other institution-affiliated parties; and the enforcement
of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial
determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not
granted.

Safety and
Soundness Guidelines

The federal banking
agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing
potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired. The
guidelines establish operational and managerial standards relating to: (1) internal
controls, information systems, and internal audit systems; (2) loan
documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest-rate exposure; (5) asset
growth and asset quality; and (6) compensation, fees, and benefits. In
addition, the federal banking agencies have adopted safety and soundness
guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to
ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and
reserves.


Premiums for
Deposit Insurance

Silicon Valley Bank’s deposit accounts are insured by
the Bank Insurance Fund, as administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, up to the maximum permitted by law. The FDIC may assess premiums
to maintain a sufficient fund balance. The amount charged is based on the
capital level of an institution and on a supervisory assessment based upon the
results of examination findings by the institution’s primary federal regulator
and other information deemed relevant by the FDIC to the institution’s
financial condition and the risk posed to the Bank Insurance Fund. As of December 31,
2004, the FDIC’s semi-annual assessment for the insurance of BIF deposits
ranged from zero (0) to twenty seven (27) cents per $100 of insured deposits.
The FDIC may increase or decrease the premium rate on a semi-annual
basis. As of December 31, 2004, Silicon Valley Bank’s assessment rate was
zero.

Silicon Valley Bank is
also required to pay an annual assessment of approximately six (6) cents
per $100 of insured deposits toward the retirement of U.S. government-issued
financing corporation bonds.

Community
Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending

Silicon Valley Bank is
subject to a variety of fair lending laws and reporting obligations, including
the CRA. The CRA generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate
the record of a bank in meeting the credit needs of its local communities,
including low- to moderate-income neighborhoods. In November 2003,
the Federal Reserve Board rated Silicon Valley Bank “satisfactory” in complying
with its CRA obligations. A bank can become subject to substantial penalties
and corrective measures for any violation of fair lending laws. When regulating
and supervising other activities or assessing whether to approve certain
applications, the federal banking agencies may consider a bank’s record of
compliance with such laws and CRA obligations.

Privacy

The GLB Act imposed customer privacy requirements on
any company engaged in financial activities. Under these requirements, a
financial company is required to protect the security and confidentiality of
customer nonpublic personal information. Also, for customers who obtain a
financial product such as a loan for personal, family, or household purposes, a
financial company is required to disclose its privacy policy to the customer at
the time the relationship is established and annually thereafter. The financial
company must also disclose its policies concerning the sharing of the customer’s
nonpublic personal information with affiliates and third parties. If an
exemption is not available, a financial company must provide consumers with a
notice of its information-sharing practices that allows the consumer to
reject the disclosure of its nonpublic personal information to third parties.
Third parties that receive such information are subject to the same
restrictions as the financial company on the re-use of the information.
Finally, a financial company is prohibited from disclosing an account number or
similar item to a third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing,
or marketing through electronic mail. Financial companies were required to be
in compliance with these consumer privacy requirements no later than July 1,
2001.

The California Financial
Information Privacy Act (SB1) became effective on July 1, 2004, and
applies to financial institutions doing business in the State of California. SB1
tightens existing federal restrictions on the sharing of consumer nonpublic
personal information with affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties.

Silicon
Valley Bank has written policies with regard to the sharing of consumer
nonpublic personal information. Our policies comply with both federal and
California rules applicable to the security and confidentiality of
consumer nonpublic personal information.


USA Patriot Act of

As part of the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the USA Patriot Act), Congress adopted the
International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act
of 2001 (“IMLAFATA”). IMLAFATA amended the Bank Secrecy Act and adopted certain
additional measures that established or increased already existing obligations
of financial institutions, including Silicon Valley Bank, to identify their
customers, watch for and report upon suspicious transactions, respond to
requests for information by federal banking regulatory authorities and law
enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial institutions.
The Secretary of the Treasury has adopted several regulations to implement
these provisions. Pursuant to certain of
these regulations, Silicon Valley Bank may not establish, maintain, administer,
or manage a correspondent account in the United States for, or on behalf of, a
foreign shell bank. In addition, IMLAFATA expands the circumstances
under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited. IMLAFATA also amended the
BHC Act and the Bank Merger Act to require the federal banking regulatory
authorities to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money
laundering activities when reviewing an application to expand operations.
Silicon Valley Bank has in place a Bank Secrecy Act compliance program.

Regulation of
Certain Subsidiaries

Two of our subsidiaries, SVB Alliant and SVB
Securities, are registered as broker-dealers with the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) and as such are subject to
regulation by the NASD and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our
investment advisory subsidiaries, Woodside Asset Management, Inc., and SVB
Asset Management, are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940, as amended, and are subject to that act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to Rule 15c3-1
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), which is designed
to measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer.
Under this rule, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain the
minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet broker-dealers’ continuing
commitments to customers and others. Under certain circumstances, this rule could
limit the ability of Bancshares to withdraw capital from SVB Alliant and limit
the ability of Silicon Valley Bank to withdraw capital from SVB Securities.

As broker-dealers, SVB
Alliant and SVB Securities are also subject to other regulations covering the
operations of their respective businesses, including sales and trading
practices; use of client funds and securities; and conduct of directors,
officers, and employees. Broker-dealers are also subject to regulation by state
securities administrators in the states where they do business. Violations of
the stringent regulations governing the actions of a broker-dealer can result
in the revocation of broker-dealer licenses; the imposition of censures or
fines; the issuance of cease and desist orders; and the suspension or expulsion
from the securities business of a firm, its officers, or its employees. The SEC
and the NASD, in particular, emphasize the need for supervision and control by
broker-dealers of their employees.

Item 2.   Properties

Our corporate
headquarters facility consists of three buildings and is located at 3003 Tasman
Drive, Santa Clara, California.

On September 15, 2004, we
renegotiated the lease related to our corporate headquarters facility, which
replaced the original lease, dated March 8, 1995. The new lease covers two
buildings, comprising approximately 157,000 square feet of space, which we
occupied under the previous lease, as well as a third building, comprising
approximately 56,500 square fee of space, within the same facility complex. The
total square footage of the premises leased under the new lease arrangement is
approximately 213,500 square feet, which is approximately the same square
footage of our corporate headquarters under its previous leases. The term of
the new corporate headquarters lease began retroactively on August 1,
2004, and will end on September 30, 2014, unless terminated earlier.

In 2002, we exited leased premises, located in Santa
Clara, California, totaling approximating 18,000 square feet. The lease on
that building will expire in August 2005. Our management determined that
the premises would have no future economic value to our operations, except for
any potential future sublease arrangement. Therefore, during 2002, we incurred
charge-offs of approximately $2.5 million related to the exit of these premises.

We currently operate 25
regional offices. We operate throughout the Silicon Valley with offices in
Fremont, Santa Clara, Palo Alto and on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park. Other
regional offices in California include Irvine, Los Angeles, Napa Valley, San Diego,
San Francisco, and Sonoma. Office locations outside of California include:
Phoenix, Arizona; Boulder, Colorado; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois;
Boston, Massachusetts; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York, New York; Durham,
North Carolina; Portland, Oregon; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Austin, Texas;
Dallas, Texas; Vienna, Northern Virginia; and Seattle, Washington. All of our
properties are occupied under leases, which expire at various dates through
2014, and in most instances include options to renew or extend at market rates
and terms. We also own leasehold improvements, equipment, furniture, and
fixtures at our offices, all of which are used in our business activities.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are subject to legal claims and
proceedings that are in the normal course of our business. While the outcome of
these matters is currently not determinable, based on information available to
the Company, its review of such claims to date and consultation with its
outside counsel, we do not currently expect that the ultimate costs to resolve
these matters, if any, will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Market Information

Our
common stock is traded over the counter on the National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) national market under the
symbol SIVB. The per share range of high and low sale prices for our common
stock as reported on the NASDAQ national market, as applicable, for each three
month period over the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, are as
follows:

Stockholders

There were 689 registered
holders of our stock as of December 31, 2004. Additionally, we believe
there were approximately 7,027 beneficial holders of common stock whose shares
are held in the name of brokerage firms or other financial institutions. We are
not provided with the number or identities of all of these stockholders, but we
have estimated the number of such stockholders from the number of stockholder
documents requested by these brokerage firms for distribution to their
customers.

Dividends

We have not paid cash dividends on our common stock
since 1992. Currently, we have no plan to pay cash dividends on our common
stock. Periodically, we evaluate the decision of paying cash dividends in the
context of our performance, general economic performance, and relevant tax and
financial parameters. Our ability to pay cash dividends is limited by generally
applicable corporate and banking laws and regulations. See Item 1.

Item 6.   Selected Consolidated Financial Data

The following selected
consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and supplementary data as presented in Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications have been made to
our prior years’ results to conform to 2004 presentations. Such
reclassifications had no effect on the results of operations or stockholders’
equity. In addition, the common stock summary information has been restated to
reflect a two-for-one stock split on May 15, 2000.


(1)

Adoption
of FIN No. 46 and SFAS No. 150 in the latter half of 2003 resulted in
a change of classification of trust preferred securities distribution expense
from noninterest expense to interest expense on a prospective basis. Additionally,
the adoption of FIN No. 46 and SFAS No. 150 resulted in a change of
classification of trust preferred securities from noninterest bearing funding
sources to interest-bearing liabilities on a prospective basis. Prior to
adoption of FIN No. 46 and SFAS No. 150, in accordance with accounting
rules in effect at that time, we recorded trust preferred securities
distribution expense as noninterest expense. On October 30, 2003, $50.0
million in cumulative 7.0% trust preferred securities were issued through a
newly formed special purpose trust, SVB Capital II. We received $51.5 million
in proceeds from the issuance of 7.0% junior subordinated debentures to SVB
Capital II. A portion of the net proceeds were used to redeem the existing
$40.0 million of 8.25% Trust Preferred Securities. Approximately $1.3 million
of deferred issuance costs related to redemption of the $40.0 million 8.25%
trust preferred securities were included in interest expense in the fourth
quarter of 2003.

Historically,
we aggregated our allowance for loan losses and allowance for loan loss
contingency and reflected the aggregate allowance in our allowance for loan and
lease losses (ALLL) balance. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2004, we
reflected our allowance for loan and lease losses in our ALLL balance and allowance
for loan loss contingency in other liabilities. These reclassifications were
also made to prior periods’ balance sheets to conform to current period’s
presentations. Additionally, we reclassified expense from the provision for
loan losses related to changes in the allowance for loan loss contingency into
noninterest expense for all periods presented. Such reclassifications had no
effect on our results of operations or stockholders’ equity but have had the
effect of lowering our ALLL to total gross loans. See Credit Quality table
included under Credit Quality and the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses under
Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations—Financial Condition.


Item
7.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Management’s discussion and analysis contains
forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations
and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results
could differ materially because of factors discussed in “Item 7A. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Factors
That May Affect Future Results”.

The following discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data
as presented in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain
reclassifications have been made to our prior years’ results to conform to 2004
presentations. Such reclassifications had no effect on our results of
operations or stockholders’ equity.

Overview of Company Operations

Silicon Valley Bancshares is a bank holding company
and a financial holding company that was incorporated in the state of Delaware
in March 1999. Our principal subsidiary, Silicon Valley Bank, is a
California state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve
System. Silicon Valley Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. Our corporate headquarters is located at 3003 Tasman
Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054, and our telephone number is 408.654.7400.
When we refer to “Silicon Valley Bancshares,” or “we” or use similar words, we
intend to include Silicon Valley Bancshares and all of its subsidiaries
collectively, including Silicon Valley Bank. When we refer to “Bancshares,” we
are referring only to the parent company, Silicon Valley Bancshares.

For over 20 years, we have been dedicated to helping
entrepreneurs succeed, specifically focusing on industries where we have deep
knowledge and relationships. Our focus is on the technology, life science,
private equity, and premium wine industries. We continue to diversify our
products and services to support our clients throughout their life cycles,
regardless of their age or size. We offer a range of financial services that
generate three distinct sources of income.

In part, our income is generated from interest rate
differentials. The difference between the interest rates paid by us on
interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the
interest rates received on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to
clients and securities held in our investment portfolio, accounts for the major
portion of our earnings. Our deposits are largely obtained from commercial
clients within our technology, life science, private equity, and premium wine
industry sectors, and, to a lesser extent, from individuals served by our
Private Client Services group. We do not obtain deposits from conventional
retail sources and have no brokered deposits. As part of negotiated credit
facilities and certain other services, we frequently obtain rights to acquire
stock in the form of warrants in certain client companies.

Fee-based services also generate income for our
business. We market our full range of financial services to all of our
commercial and private equity firm clients. In addition to commercial banking
and private client services, we offer fee-based merger and acquisition
services, private placements, and investment and advisory services. Our ability
to integrate and cross-sell our diverse financial services to our clients is a
strength of our business model.

In addition, we seek to
obtain returns through investments in private equity and venture capital fund
investments. We manage three limited partnerships: a venture capital fund that
invests directly in privately held companies and two funds that invest in other
venture capital funds.

Critical Accounting Policies

The accompanying management’s discussion and analysis
of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance


with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management evaluates
estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical
experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the accounting policies and estimates
discussed below are the most critical to our audited consolidated financial
statements because their application places the most significant demands on our
management regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. The financial
impact of each estimate, to the extent significant to financial results, is
discussed in the applicable sections of the management’s discussion and
analysis. As of December 31, 2004, there have been no material changes to
these policies since the last reporting period.

Our senior management
discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these critical
accounting policies with our audit committee on January 26, 2005.

Marketable Equity Securities

Our investments in marketable equity securities
include:

·

By
receipt of warrants for shares of publicly traded companies.

·

Investments
in shares of publicly traded companies. Equity securities in our warrant,
direct equity, and venture capital fund portfolios generally become marketable
when a portfolio company completes an initial public offering on a publicly
reported market or is acquired by a publicly traded company.

Unrealized gains on
warrants and unrealized gains or losses on equity investment securities are
recorded upon the establishment of a readily determinable fair value of the
underlying security, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Instruments.”

·

Unrealized
gains or losses after applicable taxes, on available-for-sale marketable equity
securities that result from initial public offerings are excluded from earnings
and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. We are often contractually restricted from
selling equity securities for a certain period of time subsequent to the
portfolio company’s initial public offering. Often equity securities held by us
for sale are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities
Act). In such cases, we often seek exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act by effecting sales of equity securities of the portfolio
company in compliance with the current public information, holding period,
volume limitation and manner of sale requirements of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act. In addition, as an inducement to the underwriter(s) to
underwrite such an offering, security holders, including us, typically enter
into an agreement with the underwriter(s) and/or the portfolio company,
pursuant to which the security holder agrees to refrain from selling the
securities held by such holder for a period of time, often 180 days, after the
initial public offering. As a result of such regulatory and contractual requirements,
we are frequently restricted for some period of time in our ability to
liquidate portfolio securities even after a portfolio company has completed an
initial public offering. Gains or losses on these marketable equity instruments
are recorded in our consolidated net income in the period the underlying
securities are sold to a third party.


·

If
we possess a warrant that can be settled with a net cash payment to us, the
warrant meets the definition of a derivative instrument. Changes in fair value
of such derivative instruments are recognized as securities gains or losses in
our consolidated net income.

Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair
value, which initially is the purchase cost of the securities. However, a
decline in the fair value of any of these securities that is considered
other-than-temporary is recorded in our consolidated net income in the period
the impairment occurs. The cost basis of the underlying security is written
down to fair value as a new cost basis.

Marketable equity securities held through our venture
capital fund, Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP, are recorded at fair value,
which initially is the purchase cost of the securities. Holdings that are
saleable without restriction are valued at the most recent stock exchange
closing price prior to the valuation. In addition, holdings that are subject to
limitations under Rule 144 and/or Rule 145 or underwriter lock-ups,
or in cases where Bancshares and its affiliates could be considered an
affiliate of the issuer are discounted to allow for possible price reduction
due to restrictions on liquidity. Discounts will range dependent upon many
factors, including but not limited to co-investor discount(s), trading volume,
and price volatility.

We consider our marketable
equity securities accounting policies to be critical, as the timing and amount
of income, if any, from these instruments typically depend upon factors beyond
our control. These factors include the general condition of the public equity
markets, levels of mergers and acquisitions activity, fluctuations in the
market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies, and legal and
contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities

We invest in
non-marketable equity securities in several ways:

·

By
receipt of warrants for shares of privately held companies.

·

By
direct purchases of preferred or common stock in privately held companies.

·

By
capital contributions to venture capital funds, which in turn make investments
in preferred or common stock of privately held companies.

·

Through
our venture capital fund, Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP, which makes
investments in preferred or common stock of privately held companies.

·

Through
our funds of funds, SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP and SVB Strategic
Investors Fund II, LP, which make investments in venture capital funds, which
in turn, invest in privately held companies.

·

Through
our investments in Partners for Growth, LP and Gold Hill Venture Lending 03,
LP, which provide financing to privately held companies in the form of loans
and equity.

Unexercised warrant securities in private companies
are initially recorded at a nominal value on our consolidated balance sheets. They
are carried at this value until they become marketable or expire, except in the
following circumstance:

Gains on warrant and gains or losses on equity
investment securities that result from a portfolio company being acquired by a
publicly traded company are marked-to-market when the acquisition occurs. The
resulting gains or losses are recognized into consolidated net income on that
date, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, Issue No. 91-5, “Nonmonetary
Exchange of Cost—Method
Investments.” Further fluctuations in the market value of these marketable
equity securities are excluded from consolidated net income and are reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of
stockholders’ equity. Upon the sale of these equity securities to a third
party, gains and losses, which are measured from the adjusted cost basis, are
recognized in our consolidated net income.


We account for non-marketable equity investment
securities, including warrants, other than those held by the SVB Strategic
Investors Fund, LP, SVB Strategic Investors Fund II, LP, Silicon Valley
BancVentures, LP, Partners for Growth, LP, and Gold Hill Venture Lending 03,
LP, on a cost basis. In the event of a stock-based acquisition of a
non-publicly traded issuer by a publicly traded company, we will realize gains
or losses on these securities in our consolidated net income when the
transaction occurs.

A summary of our
accounting policies for other non-marketable equity securities is presented in
the following table. A complete description of the accounting policies follows
the table.

cost basis as our interests are considered minor because we own less than 5.0%
of the company and have no influence over the company’s operating and financial
policies. Our cost basis in each investment is reduced by returns until the
cost basis of the individual investment is fully recovered. Returns in excess
of the cost basis are recorded as investment gains in noninterest income.

The values of the investments are reviewed at least
quarterly, giving consideration to the facts and circumstances of each
individual investment. Management’s review of private equity investments
typically includes the relevant market conditions, offering prices, operating
results, financial conditions, and exit strategies. A decline in the fair value
that is considered other-than-temporary is recorded in our consolidated net
income in the period the impairment occurs. Any estimated loss is recorded in
noninterest income as investment losses.

Investments held by Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP
are recorded at fair value using investment accounting rules. The investments
consist principally of stock in private companies that are not traded on a
public market and are subject to restrictions on resale. These investments are
carried at estimated fair value as determined by the general partner. The
valuation generally remains at cost until such time that there is significant evidence
of a change in value based upon consideration of the relevant market
conditions, offering prices, operating results, financial conditions, exit
strategies, and other pertinent information. The general partner, Silicon
Valley BancVentures, Inc. is owned and controlled by Bancshares and has an
ownership interest of 10.7% in Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP. The limited
partners do not have substantive participating rights. Therefore, Silicon
Valley BancVentures, LP is consolidated and any gains or losses resulting from
changes in the estimated fair value of the investments are recorded as
investment gains or losses in our consolidated net income. The portion of any
gains or losses belonging to the limited partners is reflected in minority
interest in net gains or losses of consolidated affiliates and adjusts
Bancshares’ consolidated net income to reflect its percentage ownership.

The SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP and SVB Strategic
Investors Fund II, LP (SIF I and II) portfolios consist primarily of investments
in venture capital funds, which are recorded at fair value using investment
company accounting rules. The carrying value of the investments is determined
by the general partners based on the percentage of SIF I and II’s interest in
the total fair market value as provided by each venture capital fund investment.
SVB Strategic Investors, LLC and SVB Strategic Investors II, LLC generally
utilize the fair values assigned to the underlying respective portfolio
investments by the


management of the venture
capital funds. The estimated fair value of the investments is determined after
giving consideration to the relevant market conditions, offering prices,
operating results, financial conditions, exit strategy, and other pertinent
information. The general partner of SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP, SVB
Strategic Investors, LLC, is owned and controlled by Bancshares and has an
ownership interest of 11.1%. The general partner of SVB Strategic Investors
Fund II, LP, SVB Strategic Investors II, LLC, is owned and controlled by
Bancshares and has an ownership interest of 14.4%. The limited partners of
these funds do not have substantive participating rights. Therefore, SIF I and
II are consolidated and any gains or losses resulting from changes in the
estimated fair value of the venture capital fund investments are recorded as
investment gains or losses in our consolidated net income. The other limited
partners share of any gains or losses is reflected in minority interest in net
gains or losses of consolidated affiliates and adjusts Bancshares’ consolidated
net income to reflect its percentage ownership.

Investments held by Partners for Growth, LP and Gold
Hill Venture Lending 03, LP are recorded at fair value using investment
accounting rules. The investments consist principally of loans and equity
investments in private companies that are not traded on a public market and are
subject to restrictions on resale. These investments are carried at estimated
fair value as determined by the general partner. The general partner of
Partners for Growth, LP, Partners for Growth GP, L.L.C, is not owned by
Bancshares. Bancshares has an ownership interest of 53.2% in Partners for
Growth, LP and therefore, the fund is consolidated and any gains or losses
resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the investments are
recorded as investment gains or losses in our consolidated net income. The
portion of any gains or losses belonging to the limited partners is reflected
in minority interest in net gains or losses of consolidated affiliates and
adjusts Bancshares’ consolidated net income to reflect its percentage ownership.
Bancshares has a 90.7% ownership interest in the general partner of Gold Hill
Venture Lending 03, LP, Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners 03, LLC. Both Bancshares
and Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners 03, LLC have an ownership interest of
5.0% and 4.8%, respectively, in Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP. The limited
partners of the fund have the substantive ability to remove the general partner
without cause. Therefore, Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP is not consolidated
and Bancshares carries the investments in the fund at estimated fair value as
determined by the general partner. Changes in the estimated fair value of the
investment are recorded as investment gains or losses in our consolidated net
income.

We consider our marketable
and non-marketable equity securities accounting policies to be critical, as the
timing and amount of gain or losses, if any, from these instruments depend upon
factors beyond our control. These factors include the general condition of the
public equity markets, levels of mergers and acquisitions activity, and legal
and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities. Therefore,
we cannot predict future gains or losses with any degree of accuracy and any
gains or losses are likely to vary materially from period to period. In
addition, the valuation of non-marketable equity securities included in our
financial statements represents our best interpretation of the underlying
equity securities performance at this time. Because of the inherent uncertainty
of valuations, the estimated values of these securities may differ
significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for
the securities existed, and the differences could be material. Future adverse
changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying
investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying
value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment’s carrying
value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. For
further information related to non-marketable equity securities for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, please refer to the table under Part II—Item
8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7.
Investment Securities.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

We consider our accounting policy relating to the
estimation of the allowance for loan and lease losses to be critical as
estimation of the allowance involves material estimates by our management and
is


particularly susceptible
to significant changes in the near term. Our loan loss reserve methodology is
applied to the funded debt as a contra-asset and to our unfunded loan
commitments as a reserve to Other Liabilities. Except as described herein, the
methodology for the determination of an appropriate reserve for funded and
unfunded loan commitments is the same.

We define credit risk as the probability of sustaining
a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in
accordance with the terms of the contract. Through the administration of loan
policies and monitoring of the loan portfolio, our management seeks to reduce
such credit risks. While we follow underwriting and credit monitoring
procedures, which we believe are appropriate in growing and managing the loan
portfolio, in the event of nonperformance by these other parties, our potential
exposure to credit losses could significantly affect our consolidated results
of operations and financial condition.

The allowance for loan and lease losses is established
through a provision for loan losses charged to expense to provide for credit
risk. Our allowance for loan and lease losses is established for loan losses
that are probable but not yet realized. The process of anticipating loan losses
is imprecise. Our management applies the following evaluation process to our
loan portfolio to estimate the required allowance for loan and lease losses:

We maintain a systematic process for the evaluation of
individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses. On a
quarterly basis, each loan in our portfolio is assigned a credit risk rating. Credit
risk-ratings are assigned on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing loans with
a low risk of nonpayment, 9 representing loans with the highest risk of
nonpayment, and 10 representing loans, which have been charged-off. This credit
risk-rating evaluation process includes, but is not limited to, consideration
of such factors as payment status, the financial condition of the borrower,
borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral values,
potential loan concentrations, and general economic conditions. Our policies
require a committee of senior management to review at least quarterly, credit
relationships that exceed specific dollar values. Our review process evaluates
the appropriateness of the credit risk rating and allocation of allowance for
loan and lease losses, as well as other account management functions. Our
Enterprise Risk Management department through a co-sourced relationship,
reviews a selection of credit relationships. In addition, our management
receives and approves an analysis for all impaired loans, as defined by the
SFAS No. 114, “Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.” The
allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated based on a formula allocation
for similarly risk-rated loans, or for specific risk issues, which suggest a
probable loss factor exceeding the formula allocation for a specific loan, or
for individual impaired loans as determined by SFAS No. 114.

Our evaluation process was
designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We
assess the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio by utilizing modeling
techniques. For this purpose, we have developed a statistical model based on
historical loan loss migration to estimate an appropriate allowance for
outstanding loan balances. In addition, we apply a macro allocation to the
results of the aforementioned model to ascertain the total allowance for loan
and lease losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other
objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of the
allowance for loan and lease losses, relies, to a great extent, on the judgment
and experience of our management.

Historical Loan Loss Migration Model

We use the historical loan loss migration model as a
basis for determining expected loan loss factors by credit risk-rating category.
The effectiveness of the historical loan loss migration model is predicated on
the theory that historical trends are predictive of future experience. Specifically,
the model calculates the likelihood and rate of a loan in one risk-rating
category moving one category lower using loan data from our portfolio.


We analyze the historical
loan loss migration trend by compiling gross loan loss data and by credit risk
rating for the rolling twelve-month periods as of the end of each quarter. Each
of the loans charged-off over the twelve-month period is assigned a credit risk
rating at the period end of each of the preceding four quarters. On an annual
basis, the model calculates charged-off loans as a percentage of current period
end loans by credit risk-rating category. The percentages are averaged and are
aggregated to estimate our loan loss factors. The annual periods are reviewed
and averaged to form the loan loss factors for several quarters of history. The
current period-end client loan balances are aggregated by risk-rating category.
Loan loss factors for each risk-rating category are ultimately applied to the
respective period-end client loan balances for each corresponding risk-rating
category to provide an estimation of the allowance for loan and lease losses.

Macro Allocations

A macro allocation
is calculated each quarter based upon an assessment of the risks that may lead
to a loan loss experience different from our historical results. These risks
are aggregated to become our macro allocation. Based on management’s prediction
or estimate of changing risks in the lending environment, the macro allocation
may vary significantly from period to period and includes but is not limited to
consideration of the following factors:

·

Changes
in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and
collections, and charge-off and recovery practices.

·

Changes
in national and local economic business conditions, including the market and
economic condition of our clients’ industry sectors.

·

Changes
in the nature of our loan portfolio.

·

Changes
in experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff.

·

Changes
in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans.

·

Changes
in the trend of the volume of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings,
and other loan modifications.

Finally, we compute
several modified versions of the model, which provide additional assurance that
the statistical results of the historical loan loss migration model are
reasonable. Our Chief Credit Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluate the
adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the results of our
analysis.

Allowance for Loan Loss Contingency

We reserve for the
possibility of an unfunded loan commitment being funded and subsequently being
charged-off. Each quarter, every unfunded client credit commitment is allocated
to a credit risk-rating category in accordance with each client’s credit risk
rating. We use the historical loan loss factors described above to calculate
the possible loan loss experience if unfunded credit commitments are funded. Separately,
we use historical trends to calculate the probability of an unfunded credit
commitment being funded by us. We apply the loan funding probability factor to
risk-factor adjusted unfunded commitments by credit risk-rating to derive the
reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The loan loss contingency reserve may
also include certain macro allocations as deemed appropriate by our management.


Goodwill

Please see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies, for a description of our process for evaluating goodwill. Goodwill,
which arises from the purchase price exceeding the assigned value of the net
assets of an acquired business, represents the value attributable to
unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired. Our goodwill at December 31,
2004, related to the acquisition of SVB Alliant (Alliant Partners) a mergers
and acquisitions firm. The value of this goodwill is supported by the free cash
flows from the acquired businesses. A decline in earnings as a result of a
decline in mergers and acquisitions transaction volume or a decline in the
valuations of mergers and acquisitions clients could lead to impairment, which
would be recorded as a write-down in our consolidated net income.

On an annual basis or as circumstances dictate, our
management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may
indicate impairment in the carrying amount. The evaluation methodology for
potential impairments is inherently complex and involves significant management
judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions. We evaluate impairment using
a two-step process. First, we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting
unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the
carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting
unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare the “implied” fair value, defined
below, of the reporting unit’s goodwill with its carrying amount. If the
carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then writing
goodwill down to the implied fair value recognizes goodwill impairment.

We primarily use a discounted future cash flows
approach to value the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment. These
estimates involve many assumptions, including expected results of operations,
assumed discounts rates, and assumed growth rates for the reporting units. The
discount rate used is based on standard industry practice, taking into account
the expected equity risk premium, the size of the business, and the probability
of the reporting unit achieving its financial forecasts. The implied fair value
is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the
assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the unit had been acquired in a
business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price.

Events that may indicate
goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in results of
operations of the business, economic or political climate, an adverse action or
assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, and a
more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or disposed
of. More information about goodwill is included in Item 8-Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Factors
That May Affect Future Results.

Results of Operations

Earnings Summary

We reported consolidated
net income of $65.4 million in 2004, as compared to consolidated net income of
$12.0 million in 2003 and $53.4 million in 2002. Diluted earnings per common
share totaled $1.74 for 2004, as compared to $0.32 for 2003 and $1.18 for 2002.

Dilutive Effect of
Contingently Convertible Debt on our Diluted Earnings per Share Calculation

We included the dilutive
effect of the $150.0 million zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes due June 15,
2008 in our fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculation using the
treasury stock method, in accordance with the provisions of Emerging Issue Task
Force (EITF) issue No. 90-19, “Convertible Bonds With Issuer Option to
Settle in Cash Upon Conversion” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(SFAS) No. 128, “Earnings Per Share”. The exposure draft of SFAS No. 128R,
if adopted in its proposed form, will require us to change our accounting for
the calculation of EPS on our contingently convertible


debt to
the if converted method. If converted treatment of the contingently convertible
debt would have decreased EPS by $0.17 per diluted common share, or 10 percent
for 2004.

2004 Compared
to 2003

Increase in Consolidated
Net Income

—Increase in Net Interest Income, Decrease
in Impairment of Goodwill Expense

Consolidated net income increased by $53.4 million
between 2004 and 2003:

·

Impairment
of goodwill expense decreased by $61.1 million. In 2003, we incurred charges
aggregating $63.0 million related to our investment banking business unit, SVB
Alliant;

·

Net
interest income increased by $45.9 million, primarily due to increased interest
income from both investment securities and loans; and

·

Noninterest
income increased by $31.0 million, largely due to increases in corporate
finance fees, client investments fees and foreign exchange fees.

These improvements to
consolidated net income were partially offset by increases in certain
noninterest expense categories, particularly compensation and benefits expense,
which was higher in 2004 primarily due to variable compensation, attributable
to our improved financial performance. Additionally, we experienced an increase
in professional services expense primarily due to expenses associated with
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. Finally, our effective tax rate increased to 37.8%
in 2004 from 21.0% in 2003.

2003 Compared
to 2002

Decrease in Consolidated Net Income

—Decrease
in Net Interest Income, Impairment of Goodwill Expense

The decrease in consolidated net income between 2003
and 2002 primarily resulted from an increase of $82.2 million in noninterest
expense. The increase in noninterest expense was principally due to the
following factors:

·

Impairment
of goodwill charges aggregating $63.0 million related to SVB Alliant, and

·

Increase
in expense associated with our incentive compensation program, which we believe
was necessary to retain our professional talent in an improving economic
environment.

Additionally, due to a decrease in the
weighted-average prime rate of 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2003,
from 4.7% for the year ended December 31, 2002, we earned lower interest
income from our investment securities and loan portfolios, which resulted in a
decline in net interest income. However, our provision for loan loss expense
decreased by $10.1 million for 2003, as compared to 2002, largely due to a
significant loan loss recovery, and our improved credit quality.


The
major components of net income and changes in these components are summarized
in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, and are discussed in more detail on the following pages.

Net Interest Income
and Margin

Net interest income is defined as the difference
between interest earned (primarily on loans, investment securities and federal
funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell) and interest
paid on funding sources (such as deposits and borrowings). Net interest income
is our principal source of revenue. Net interest margin is defined as the
amount of net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, expressed
as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The average yield earned on
interest-earning assets is the amount of taxable-equivalent interest income
expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The average rate
paid on funding sources is defined as interest expense as a percentage of
average interest-earning assets.


The
following table sets forth average assets, liabilities, minority interest and
stockholders’ equity, interest income and interest expense, average yields and
rates, and the composition of our net interest margin for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002.

(1)

Includes average interest-yielding deposits in other
financial institutions of $10,559, $783, and $609 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

(2)

Average noninterest-earning investment securities,
primarily marketable and non-marketable equity securities, are excluded from
the totals of investment securities and are included in other assets. Average
noninterest-earning investment securities amounted to $108,458, $102,742 and
$97,143 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

(3)

Interest income on nontaxable investments is presented
on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%
for all years presented. These adjustments were $2,694, $3,365, and $3,712 for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

(4)

Average loans include average nonaccrual loans of
$14,533, $16,089, and $19,602 in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

(5)

Average loans are net of average unearned income of
$13,448, $12,573, and $11,651 in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

(6)

Loan interest income includes loan fees of $36,399,
$36,348, and $36,701 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(7)

Adoption of

FIN No. 46 and SFAS No. 150 in
the latter half of 2003 resulted in a change of classification of trust
preferred securities distribution expense from noninterest expense to interest
expense on a prospective basis. Additionally, the adoption of FIN No. 46
and SFAS No. 150 resulted in a change of classification of trust preferred
securities from noninterest-bearing funding sources to interest-bearing
liabilities on a prospective basis. Prior to adoption of FIN No. 46 and
SFAS No. 150, in accordance with accounting rules in effect at that
time, the company recorded trust preferred securities distribution expense as
noninterest expense. On October 30, 2003, $50.0 million in cumulative 7.0%
trust preferred securities were issued through a newly formed special purpose
trust, SVB Capital II. We received $51.5 million in proceeds from the issuance
of 7.0% junior subordinated debentures to SVB Capital II. A portion of the net
proceeds were used to redeem the existing $40.0 million of 8.25% trust
preferred securities. Approximately $1.3 million of deferred issuance costs
related to redemption of the $40.0 million 8.25% trust preferred securities
were included in interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2003.


Net
interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “volume
change.” Net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on
interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities,
referred to as “rate change”. The following table sets forth changes in
interest income for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest
expense for each major category of interest-bearing liabilities. The table also
reflects the amount of simultaneous changes attributable to both volume and
rate for the years indicated. For this table, changes that are not solely due
to either volume or rate are allocated in proportion to the percentage changes
in average volume and average rate. Changes relating to investments in
non-taxable municipal securities are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent
basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 35% for all years presented.

2004 Compared to

Net Interest Income

Net interest income, on a
fully taxable-equivalent basis, totaled $237.4 million for 2004, an increase of
$45.2 million, or 23.5%, from 2003. The increase in net interest income was the
result of a $43.1 million increase in interest income and a $2.1 million decrease
in interest expense.

Interest Income—Net Increase in Interest-Earning
Assets (Volume Variance)

The $43.1 million increase in interest income for
2004, as compared to 2003, was primarily the result of a $31.8 million
favorable volume variance. The favorable volume variance resulted from a $708.9
million, or 19.6% increase, in average interest-earning assets. We believe
increases in our sources of funding, largely deposits, were the main
contributors to the increase in average interest-earning assets. We believe
deposits increased due to an improved venture capital funding environment and
general improvements in business conditions for many of our clients. This
increase in interest-earning assets was primarily centered in investment
securities, which increased $502.6 million, and loans, which increased $154.4
million.


Average investment securities increased by $502.6
million, resulting in an $18.4 million favorable volume variance. Throughout
2004, we continued our investment strategy of changing the investment portfolio
mix by increasing the portion of the portfolio invested in relatively
higher-yielding mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations. Our average investments in mortgage-backed securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations collectively increased by $564.8 million
for 2004 as compared to 2003, largely funded by increases in client deposits. We
estimated the duration of our investment portfolio increased to 2.1 at December 31,
2004, from 1.7 at December 31, 2003. The increase in duration was
primarily due to the increase in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized
mortgage obligations whose average duration is typically in the 2 to 5 year
range.

In addition, average loans increased by $154.4
million, or 8.6% in 2004 as compared to 2003, resulting in a $12.8 million
favorable volume variance. The volume variance is largely driven by growth in
our commercial loan category, which increased by $107.5 million. In particular,
the average balances of higher-yielding loan products such as asset-based loans
and accounts receivable factoring increased by $39.4 million and $68.6 million,
respectively. In addition, we also grew our average real estate and consumer
loan portfolios. The increase in average loans reflects an improvement in
economic activity and in the markets served by us. These new loans continue to
be subject to our existing underwriting practices. Our strategy is to grow
average loans modestly during 2005 as our corporate technology efforts continue
to develop.

Average federal funds sold
and securities purchased under agreement to resell for 2004 increased by $51.9
million, or 13.5%, resulting in a $0.7 million favorable volume variance. The
increase was mainly due to the growth in funding sources, primarily noninterest-bearing
demand deposits.

Interest Income—Shift in the Composition of Average
Interest-Earning Assets (Rate Variance)

Favorable rate variances associated with each
component of interest earning assets caused an $11.3 million increase in
interest income in 2004 as compared to 2003. Although the yields on

federal funds sold and securities purchased under
agreement to resell and investment securities increased and the yield on loans
remained unchanged, t

he yield on total average interest-earning assets
remained unchanged.

T

he overall yield
remained unchanged due to a change in the mix of our total average
interest-earning assets. In 2004, investment securities represented 44.8% of
our total average interest-earning assets and loans represented 45.1% of our total
average interest-earning assets. In 2003, investment securities represented
39.7% of our total average interest-earning assets, and loans represented 49.6%
of our total average interest-earning assets. Thus, the increase in yields
on

federal funds sold and securities
purchased under agreement to resell and investment securities in 2004 as
compared to 2003 was offset by the change in overall composition of our
interest-earning assets.

We increased our prime lending rate by 25 basis points
on five occasions in the latter half of 2004, increasing it from 4.00% to
5.25%. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 81.3%, or $1.9 billion, of
our outstanding loans were variable rate loans, which would re-price with any
further increase or any decrease in our prime lending rate, unless restricted
by the terms of any such loans.

The yield on investment securities increased by 51
basis points to 4.1% in 2004 from 3.6% for 2003, causing a $9.8 million
favorable rate variance. This was primarily due to a shift in the composition
of a portion of the investment portfolio to relatively higher-yielding
mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.

We also realized a $1.0
million favorable rate variance associated with our

federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell

,
which is largely driven by higher short-term market interest rates in 2004 as
compared to 2003. We expect to continue the trend of managing federal funds
sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell at appropriate levels
for our liquidity needs.


Interest Expense

Total interest expense for 2004 decreased by $2.1
million from 2003, despite a $166.8 million, or 10.1% increase in our
interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in interest expense was primarily the
result of a $4.0 million favorable rate variance, partially offset by a $1.9
million unfavorable volume variance.

We experienced a favorable rate variance of $4.0
million primarily due to lower interest expense related to borrowing. In the
fourth quarter of 2003, we recognized $1.3 million in deferred issuance costs
associated with the early redemption of the $40.0 million, 8.25% trust
preferred securities.

Also, in the fourth quarter of 2003, we issued $51.5
million in 7.0% junior subordinated debentures and simultaneously entered into
an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $50.0 million. This
interest rate swap agreement hedges against the risk of changes in fair value
associated with our 7.0% junior subordinated debentures. The terms of this fair
value hedge agreement provide for a swap of our 7.0% fixed rate payment for a
variable rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. For 2004, we paid interest expense
of $3.5 million on the 7.0% junior subordinated debentures. However, the fair
value hedge agreement provided income of $2.2 million, resulting in net
interest expense of $1.3 million for 2004.

There were significant fluctuations in several line
items of the total interest expense volume variance, which largely offset each
other. In particular, the implementation SFAS No. 150 and FIN No. 46
in mid 2003 required us to reclassify our trust preferred securities to the
long-term debt category during 2003. Additionally, these accounting
pronouncements also required us to classify the trust preferred securities
distribution expense as interest expense, on a prospective basis. The trust
preferred distribution expense had previously been classified as noninterest
expense.

Increases in regular money market and bonus money
market deposits contributed a $1.3 million unfavorable variance to the total
interest expense volume variance. This unfavorable volume variance was largely
offset by lower time deposits, which provided a $1.0 million favorable volume
variance. Due to the general improvement in the venture capital funding
environment, highly-liquid money market deposits have increased by $247.1
million, while longer-term time deposits have decreased by $155.9 million. Our
clients may use time deposits as collateral for letters of credit issued by
Silicon Valley Bank on their behalf, to certain third parties such as real
estate lessors. We believe time deposits have decreased partly because of a
softer real estate market, which generally reduces the frequency of these types
of arrangements. Moreover, due to the general improvement in the economic
environment, borrowings secured by time deposits have decreased.

A shift of client funds from time deposits to more
liquid money market deposits also contributed to the favorable rate variance.

The average cost of funds
of 0.3% for 2004 represented a slight decrease from 0.4% in 2003. The decrease
was largely attributable to a decrease in the cost of borrowings and to a
relative increase in noninterest-bearing funding sources as a percentage of
total funding sources.

2003 Compared to

Net Interest Income

Net interest income on a
fully taxable-equivalent basis totaled $192.2 million in 2003, a decrease of
$6.2 million, or 3.1%, from $198.4 million in 2002. The decrease in net
interest income was due to a $10.6 million, or 4.9%, decline in interest
income, offset by a $4.4 million, or 24.7%, decrease in interest expense over
the comparable prior-year period. Interest expense in 2003 included $3.0
million relating to the SFAS No. 150 and FIN No. 46-mandated
classification of trust preferred securities distribution expense as interest
expense for the latter half of 2003. For periods prior to June 30, 2003,
trust preferred securities


distribution
expense was classified as noninterest expense and therefore did not impact the
net interest margin.

Interest Income—Impact
of Declining Market Interest Rates on Interest-Earning Asset (Rate Variance)

Throughout the decreasing market interest rate
environment, we implemented numerous measures to minimize the impact to our net
interest margin. These measures included diversifying the product mix in the
investment portfolio to higher yielding, high-quality assets and reducing rates
paid on interest-bearing deposits. Additionally, we increased the duration of
our investment securities portfolio by replacing certain short-term, lower
yielding securities with longer-term, higher-yielding securities such as
collateralized mortgage obligations, thereby taking advantage of a steeper
interest rate curve. Overall, the duration of our investment securities
portfolio increased to approximately 1.7 years in 2003, from approximately 1.5
years in 2002.

The $10.6 million decrease
in interest income for 2003, as compared to 2002, was the result of a $12.4
million unfavorable rate variance associated with each component of
interest-earning assets, partially offset by a $1.8 million favorable volume
variance. Market interest rates decreased slightly during 2003, which caused
the weighted average prime rate to decline by 55 basis points from 4.7% in 2002.
Consequently, the yield on loans decreased by 60 basis points in 2003 to 8.3%
from 8.9% in 2002. In 2003, we incurred a $10.9 million unfavorable rate
variance associated with our loan portfolio. Floating rate loans, which
represent approximately 81.2% of our total loan portfolio, produced lower
interest income due to a lower average prime rate in 2003 compared to 2002. The
average yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to
resell also decreased due to the decline in market interest rates from 1.9% in
2002 to 1.2% in 2003, which caused a $1.4 million unfavorable rate variance.

Interest Income—Net
Increase in Interest-Earning Assets (Volume Variance)

Total average interest-earning assets in 2003
increased $156.2 million, or 4.5% as compared to the prior year. The increase
in total average interest-earning assets was principally funded by an increase
in average noninterest-bearing deposits of $246.0 million, or 16.2%, and an
increase in average long-term debt of $81.7 million, or 343.8%, offset by a
decrease in average stockholders’ equity of $136.0 million, or 21.6%. The
increase in average long-term debt was principally due to the issuance of
$150.0 million of zero coupon convertible debt in May 2003. The net
proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debt were largely used to
repurchase our common stock, which resulted in the aforementioned decrease in
average stockholders’ equity.

Average loans increased $37.7 million, or 2.1%, in
2003, as compared to 2002, resulting in a $3.4 million favorable volume
variance. In 2003, we grew our average loan portfolio to a record level by
continuing to focus on attracting corporate technology clients, which we
believed were under-served by our competitors. We experienced loan growth across
most of the industry sectors we serve.

Average investment securities for 2003 decreased
$113.5 million, or 7.3%, as compared to 2002, resulting in a $4.7 million
unfavorable volume variance. The decrease in average investment securities was
primarily concentrated in short-term investments, partially offset by an
increase in longer-term collateralized mortgage obligations.

Average federal funds sold and securities purchased
under agreement to resell increased $232.0 million, or 151.4%, in 2003, as
compared to the prior year, resulting in a $3.1 million favorable volume
variance. This increase was primarily due to a change in the investment
portfolio mix.

The yield on average
interest-earning assets decreased 60 basis points in 2003 from the prior year. This
decrease primarily resulted from a decline in short-term market interest rates;
thus, we earned lower yields on each component of our interest-earning assets.


Interest Expense

Total interest expense in 2003 decreased $4.4 million
from 2002. This decrease was due to a favorable rate variance of $7.4 million,
partially offset by an unfavorable volume variance of $3.0 million. The
favorable rate variance between 2003 and 2002 primarily resulted from a
reduction in the average rates paid on all of our interest-bearing deposits,
particularly those rates paid on our time deposit and bonus money market
deposit products.

The unfavorable volume variance was due in large part
to the SFAS No. 150-mandated classification of trust preferred
securities distribution expense of $3.0 million as interest expense for the
latter half of 2003. Trust preferred securities distribution expense was
previously classified as noninterest expense. Of the $3.0 million in trust
preferred securities distribution expense, approximately $1.3 million related
to the recognition of deferred issuance costs in the fourth quarter of 2003,
due to the early redemption of our 8.25% trust preferred securities. In the
fourth quarter of 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to swap
our 7.0% fixed payment on junior subordinated debentures for a variable rate
based on the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread.

Additionally, we experienced an unfavorable volume
variance related to long-term debt of $1.0 million. In the second quarter of
2003, we issued $150.0 million of zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes,
with a maturity of June 15, 2008. Although no interest was paid on the
notes, we experienced an increase in interest expense due to amortization of
the contingently convertible debt issuance costs. The overall unfavorable
volume variance caused primarily by long-term debt and trust preferred
securities was partially offset by average time deposits, which decreased from
$611.0 million in 2002 to $485.1 million in 2003, causing a $1.3 million
favorable volume variance.

The average cost of funds
paid on average interest-bearing liabilities in 2003 was 0.8% down from 1.1% in
2002. This decrease in the average cost of funds was largely due to a decrease
of 50 basis points on the average rates paid on both our money market deposit
and time deposit products.

Provision for Loan
Losses

The provision for loan
losses is based on our evaluation of the adequacy of the existing allowance for
loan and lease losses in relation to total loans and on our periodic assessment
of the inherent and identified risk dynamics of the loan portfolio resulting
from reviews of selected individual loans and loan commitments. For a more
detailed discussion of credit quality and the allowance for loan and lease
losses, see Item 7. Critical Accounting Policies and Item 7. Financial
Condition—Credit Quality and the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.

2004 Compared to 2003—Continued Improved Credit
Quality Prompts Further Recovery of Provision for Loan Losses

We realized a recovery of
provision for loan losses of $9.9 million in 2004 compared to a recovery of
provision for loan losses of $8.7 million in 2003. In 2003, our loan loss
recoveries exceeded loan charge offs by $0.2 million. We incurred net charge-offs
of approximately $2.3 million in 2004 and credit quality remained strong with
nonperforming loans at 0.6% of gross loans. We realized a slight net recovery
of loan losses in 2003. We believe the improvement in the recovery of loan
losses was primarily attributable to our improved credit risk management and to
improved economic conditions.

2003 Compared to
2002—Improved Credit Quality Leads to Recovery of Provision for Loan Losses

We realized a recovery of provision for loan losses of
$8.7 million in 2003, as compared to provision for loan losses of $7.2 million
in 2002. We realized a slight net recovery of loan losses in 2003, compared to


net charge-offs of
$5.8 million in 2002. The change in provision for loan losses for 2003, as
compared to 2002, resulted from the improvement in our loan portfolio’s credit
quality position.

A large part of the loan
recoveries in 2003 related to a settlement in August 2003 of litigation
commenced by us relating to a charged-off film loan. This was reflected in the
provision for loan losses for both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30,
2003. In October 2000, we filed a civil lawsuit for approximately $8.3
million (plus attorneys’ fees and interest) in the United States District Court
for the Central District of California, against certain insurance companies for
various causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of the duty of
good faith, and fair dealing and fraud. The lawsuit concerned our claim for
insurance coverage under an insurance policy issued to us by these insurance
companies related to a loan made by us to finance production of a film. In the
third quarter of 2003, the parties entered into a confidential and mutually
agreeable settlement agreement, after which we dismissed the lawsuit. As a
result of the settlement, we recorded significant recovery related to a
previously charged-off film loan.

Noninterest Income

The
following table summarizes the components of noninterest income and the percent
change from year to year:

2004 Compared to
2003—Increases in Most Components Drive 41.3% Increase

(1)

Client funds invested
through Silicon Valley Bancshares, maintained at third party financial
institutions.

We offer investment products and services that include
mutual funds and other investments, sweep products, and asset management
services to our clients.

Our fees, calculated on clients’ average balances,
ranged from 9 to 70 basis points (fixed income securities and Federated Sweep,
respectively) as of December 31, 2004, compared to a range of 10 to 100
basis points as of December 31, 2003.


Total client investment funds were $11.3 billion at December 31,
2004, compared to $9.3 billion at December 31, 2003, an increase of $2.0
billion, or 20.8%. As of December 31, 2004, client investment funds under
management accounted for $2.7 billion, or 23.7%, of total client investment
funds. Mutual fund products were $6.2 billion at December 31, 2004, and
$6.4 billion at December 31, 2003.

Client investment fee income increased by $2.9 million
from 2003 to 2004. Client investment fee for 2004 was $26.9 million. The
increased income was largely attributable to the growth in client investment
funds.

The increase in corporate finance fees in 2004 over
2003 was in large part due to a single large investment banking transaction,
which generated $6.1 million in fees. SVB Alliant’s business is highly variable
so we expect to see significant changes in corporate finance fees from year to
year.

The increase in letter of credit and foreign exchange
income was primarily due to a higher volume of client foreign exchange
transactions, which resulted from increased global economic activity associated
with our clients’ markets.

In 2004, we recognized income from client warrants of
$9.2 million, as compared to $7.5 million in 2003. We have historically
obtained rights to acquire stock, in the form of warrants, in certain clients,
primarily as part of negotiated credit facilities. The receipt of warrants does
not change the loan pricing, covenants, or other collateral control techniques
we employ to mitigate the risk of a loan becoming nonperforming. The collateral
requirements on loans with warrants are similar to lending arrangements where
warrants are not obtained. The timing and amount of income from the disposition
of client warrants typically depends on factors beyond our control, including
the general condition of the public equity markets as well as the merger and
acquisition environment. We therefore cannot predict the timing and amount of
warrant-related income with any degree of accuracy, and it is likely to vary
materially from period to period.

We recognized net
investment gains in 2004, as compared to net investment losses in 2003.
Investment gains for 2004 were concentrated in our managed funds of funds, our
managed venture capital fund, and direct equity investments. Losses on our
equity investments, excluding the impact of minority interest, were $1.0 for
2004 compared to $2.8 million for 2003. We expect continued variability in the
performance of our equity portfolio.

2003 Compared to
2002—Decreases in Client Investment Fees and Foreign Exchange Income, Partially
Offset by an Increase in Deposit Service Charges.

Client investment fees decreased in 2003 from 2002. Fees
on clients’ average balances ranged from 10 to 100 basis points in 2003 and
12.5 to 107 basis points in 2002. At December 31, 2003, $9.3 billion in
client funds were invested in these products, compared to $8.5 billion in 2002.
Of these funds, $6.4 billion and $8.5 billion were invested in mutual fund
products as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total invested
client funds have increased between 2003 and 2002, however the decrease in
client investment fees from year to year was due to a shift in client
investment mix. The sustained low interest rate environment has caused lower
priced investment products to become a more attractive investment strategy for
many of our clients.

In the first quarter of 2003, we established a
registered investment advisor (SVB Asset Management) to meet the demand for
active management of client investment portfolios. This action will allow us to
provide a more expansive and competitive array of investment products and
services to our clients. While the fees earned per dollar managed has been reduced,
our strategy is to make up for the lower fees through greater volume. At December 31,
2003, SVB Asset Management had $591.6 million of assets under management.


Deposit service charges increased in 2003 over 2002 as
we have expanded and enhanced our suite of fee-based financial (depository)
services and client usage has increased overall. Clients compensate us for
depository services, either through earnings credits computed on their demand
deposit balances or via explicit payments that we recognize as deposit service
charges income. Earnings credits are calculated using client average daily
deposit balances less a reserve requirement and a discounted U.S. Treasury bill
interest rate. Clients received lower earnings credits in 2003 compared to 2002
due to lower short-term market interest rates, resulting in fewer earnings
credits to offset deposit service charges.

Corporate finance fees increased slightly in 2003 from
2002. Corporate finance fees totaled $12.1 million in 2002. In 2002, SVB
Alliant, our investment-banking subsidiary, generated the entire balance of
$12.1 million. SVB Alliant’s revenues are typically a function of the valuation
of its clients’ mergers and acquisitions transactions. Economic events
depressed valuations of high technology and life science corporations in 2002
and 2003. Thus, SVB Alliant has not achieved its merger and acquisition revenue
goals. Consequently, we incurred aggregate impairment of goodwill charges of
$63.0 million in 2003; see the discussion under the heading Noninterest Expense
contained later in this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations section.

Letter of credit fees, foreign exchange fees, and
other trade finance income decreased between 2002 and 2003 as a result of
increased competition and increased availability of these product types from
other financial institutions.

Due to an increase in client initial public offering
and mergers and acquisition activities, the income from client warrants
increased between 2002 and 2003.

Credit card fees have continued to increase year over
year as a result of our increased efforts to market a full range of fee-based
financial services to our clients. In 2003, client usage of this product has
increased, as well has fees charged for this line of service.

We experienced improvements in investment securities
losses from year to year. The 2003 and 2002 losses primarily related to the
write-downs of certain venture capital fund and direct equity investments. Excluding
the impact of minority interest, the net write-downs of our equity securities
totaled approximately $2.8 million in 2003 and $4.1 million in 2002.

Other noninterest income
largely consisted of service-based fee income associated with our deposit and
loan services as well as fund management fees.


Noninterest Expense

The
following table presents the detail of noninterest expense and the percent
change, year over year:

2004 Compared to
2003—Decrease in Impairment of Goodwill, Increases in Compensation and Benefits
and Professional Services Expense

The increase in compensation and benefits expense of
$32.1 million was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation
expense of $17.5 million, or 108.1%, to $33.7 million during 2004, compared to
$16.2 million during 2003. Incentive compensation at SVB Alliant increased $6.9
million and was driven by a 66.7% increase in investment banking revenues from
$13.1 million to $21.9 million. The remaining increase in incentive
compensation is largely attributable to improved financial performance of
Silicon Valley Bank.

The remainder of the increase in compensation and
benefit expense during 2004 was largely due to increases in salaries and wages
expense, employee stock ownership plan expense, and equity-based compensation
expense. Salaries and wages expense increased by $3.6 million, or 4.6%, to $82.6
million during 2004, compared to $78.9 million during 2003. The increase was
primarily attributable to higher rates of employee salaries and wages. Average
full-time equivalent (FTE) personnel was 999 during 2004, a slight increase
from 994 FTE personnel during 2003.

Employee stock ownership plan expense increased by
$3.0 million, or 78.7%, to $6.8 million during 2004, compared to $3.8 million
during 2003. The increase was attributable to our improved consolidated
financial performance. See Item 8.—Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 18.
Employee Benefit Plans for further discussion of the employee stock ownership
plan.

Lastly, equity-based compensation increased by $1.6
million, or 155.3%, to $2.6 million in 2004, compared to $1.0 million in 2003.
This increase reflects our increased use of restricted stock and restricted
stock units, in lieu of stock options, as components of our employee
compensation structure, as we transition our equity-based compensation
programs.

Net occupancy expense remained relatively unchanged
between 2004 and 2003. However, on September 15, 2004, we renegotiated the
lease related to our corporate headquarters facility in Santa Clara,
California, which replaced the original lease, dated as of March 8, 1995.
The new lease covers two


buildings, comprising
approximately 157,000 square feet of space, which we occupied under the
previous lease, as well as a third building, comprising approximately 56,500
square feet of space, within the same facility complex. The total square feet
of the premises leased under the new lease arrangement is approximately 213,500
square feet, which is approximately the same square footage of our corporate
headquarters under its previous leases. The term of the new corporate
headquarters lease began retroactively on August 1, 2004, and will end on September 30,
2014, unless terminated on an earlier date. Based on the new lease terms, our
corporate headquarters lease expense will be lower under the new lease
arrangement. The landlord for these premises is contributing approximately $7.0
million towards the cost of these renovations, improvements, and alterations.
We expect to incur renovation, improvement, and alteration costs in excess of
this amount.

Professional services expenses consist of costs
associated with corporate legal services, litigation settlements, accounting
and auditing services, information technology and other consulting, and our
board of directors. The increase in professional services was primarily due to
three significant factors:

Firstly, in 2003, we settled the remaining aspects of
a film loan litigation and were able to recover significant legal expenses
pertaining to those proceedings. The recovery of legal costs was recorded, upon
receipt of the funds, as a reduction of legal expense in 2003.

Secondly, in 2004 we incurred an increase in
professional services fees associated with commitment of resources to document
and enhance controls required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
independent audit thereof. In particular, these costs were substantially higher
in the fourth quarter of 2004.

Lastly, we incurred approximately $1.4 million in
professional fees related to fund raising activities associated with the Gold
Hill Venture Lending 03, limited partnership which are venture debt fund
entities. These venture debt funds raised approximately $214.1 million in
capital commitments. Silicon Valley Bancshares initiated the formation of these
funds and agreed to pay a portion of the related fund raising fees.

Over the past few years, we have continued to
emphasize stringent controls over the use of external consulting services.

The increase in furniture and equipment expense is
primarily due to the consolidation of two of our offices in southern California
and the cost of furnishings for a newly opened Silicon Valley office. Also, see
data processing below.

The increase in business development and travel was
primarily due to costs related to our sponsorship of the inaugural SVB Tech
Investors Forum in September 2004. At this event, which was held in San
Francisco, California, at which 76 public and private technology companies
presented to over 500 investors. There were also additional incremental travel
expenses associated with the opening of our international subsidiaries in
London, England., and Bangalore, India in September 2004.

Correspondent bank fees increased from year to year. Many
of our correspondent banks provide earnings credits to offset bank fees we
incur when using their services. Earnings credits are generally calculated
using average daily deposit balances  less
a reserve requirement and a short-term market interest rate. We received lower
earnings credits in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to our maintaining lower
average balances with our correspondent banks and lower average short-term
market interest rates. As such, we had fewer earnings credits to offset bank
fees charges incurred by us. Thus, we incurred higher recognizable bank fees in
2004 as compared to 2003. Management made the decision to lower the average
balances with correspondent banks because we were able to earn more on our
funds by investing them than we would have benefited from lower correspondent
bank fees by maintaining larger balances with our correspondent banks.


The decrease in data processing expense was primarily
due to the renegotiation, in late 2003, of the terms of an agreement with one
of our more significant outsourced data processing providers from a data
processing arrangement to a short-term software licensing arrangement. The
change in the agreement was executed to facilitate the transition of this data
processing from the external provider to our internal resources. Hence the
expenses associated with this vendor, which were classified as data processing
in the first six months of 2003, were classified as expensed software under the
caption furniture and equipment through August 2004. We commenced the
in-sourcing of this data processing application in late 2004.

The decrease in impairment
of goodwill expense can be attributed to charges of $63.0 million incurred in
2003 related to our investment banking business unit, SVB Alliant (see further
discussion below under the

2003 Compared to 2002

analysis). In 2004, we recognized an impairment charge in the third quarter
related to our private client services business unit Woodside Asset Management
(see further discussion under Financial Condition—Goodwill below).

2003 Compared to
2002—Goodwill Impairment Charges, Increase in Variable Compensation, Decrease
in Professional Services Expense

The increase in compensation and benefits expense of $18.7
million was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation expense of
$10.1 million, or 164.1%, to $16.2 million during 2003, compared to $6.1
million during 2002. We believed the increase in incentive compensation was
necessary to retain our professional talent in an improving economic
environment.

The remainder of the increase in compensation and
benefit expense during 2003 was due to an increase in salaries and wages
expense, an increase in 401(k) benefits expense, and a residual net increase
in other employee benefits.

Salaries and wages expense increased by $4.4 million,
or 5.8%, to $79.0 million during 2003, compared to $74.6 million during 2002. The
increase was primarily attributable to higher rates of employee salaries and
wages. Average full-time equivalent (FTE) personnel of 994 during 2003 was
slightly lower from 1,000 during 2002.

401(k) benefit expense increased by $2.1 million,
or 238.7%, to $3.0 million during 2003, compared to $0.9 million during 2002. The
increase was attributable to additional matching contributions made by us to
this Plan during 2003 resulting from changes to the 401(k) plan, which
became effective as of January 1, 2003. See Item 8.—Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 18. Employee Benefit Plans for further
discussion of the changes to the 401(k) plan.

In 2003, we incurred aggregate impairment of goodwill
charges related to the SVB Alliant (formerly Alliant Partners) reporting unit
of $63.0 million ($38.7 million net of tax, or $1.04 per diluted common share
in 2003). We acquired SVB Alliant on September 28, 2001. In recent times,
economic events depressed valuations of technology and life science
corporations. Thus, SVB Alliant did not achieve its originally forecasted
results of operations. Consequently, we incurred these aggregate impairment
charges; see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Note 9. Goodwill for further information. For a discussion of our goodwill
accounting policies, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies—Goodwill.

Occupancy expense decreased by $2.8 million between
2003 and 2002. In 2002, we exited leased premises in Santa Clara, California,
approximating 18,000 square feet. The lease on the building expires in August 2005.
Our management determined that the premises would have no future economic value
to our operations, except for any potential future sub-lease arrangement. Therefore,
during 2002, we incurred charge-offs of approximately $2.5 million related
to the exit of these premises. We incurred no such charge-offs in 2003.


Professional services expenses, which consist of costs
associated with corporate legal services, litigation settlements, accounting
and auditing services, consulting, and our board of directors, has decreased
year to year. In 2003, we settled the remaining aspects of a film loan
litigation and were able to recover significant legal expenses pertaining to
those proceedings. Additionally, over the past few years, we implemented
stringent measures to control the use of external consulting services.

Furniture and equipment expenses increased in 2003
compared to 2002, mainly due to an increase in information technology
maintenance costs related to new business initiatives.

Correspondent bank fees increased from year to year. Many
of our correspondent banks provide earnings credits to offset bank fees we
incur when using their services. Earnings credits are generally calculated
using average daily deposit balances less a reserve requirement and a
short-term market interest rate. We received lower earnings credits in 2003 as
compared to 2002, due to our maintaining lower average balances with our
correspondent banks and lower market interest rates. As such, we had fewer
earnings credits to offset bank fees charges incurred by us. Thus, we incurred
higher recognizable bank fees in 2003 as compared to 2002. Management made the
decision to lower the average balances with correspondent banks because we were
able to earn more on our funds by investing them than we would have benefited
from lower correspondent bank fees by maintaining larger balances with our
correspondent banks.

Beginning July 1, 2003, trust preferred
securities distribution expense was required to be classified as interest
expense on a prospective basis, pursuant to adoption of SFAS No. 150. Therefore,
noninterest expense does not reflect trust preferred securities distribution
expense for the latter half of 2003. The 8.25% trust preferred securities,
originally issued during the second quarter of 1998, paid a fixed-rate
quarterly distribution and had a maximum maturity of 30 years. We completed the
early redemptions of the $40.0 million of 8.25% trust preferred securities in
the fourth quarter of 2003.

On June 3, 2002, we entered into a derivative
agreement with a notional amount of $40.0 million. The agreement hedged against
the risk of changes in fair value associated with our $40.0 million of 8.25%
trust preferred securities. The derivative agreement provided a $1.0 million
and $1.1 million decrease in trust preferred security distribution expense for
2003 and 2002, respectively. This interest rate swap was terminated effective June 23,
2003.

Other noninterest expense increased by $1.1 million,
or 16.4%, to $7.7 million during 2003, compared to $6.6 million during 2002. This
increase was substantially attributable to increase in operational losses,
client services expense, advertising and promotion expense, and insurance and
protection expense.

Operational losses increased by $0.9 million, or 116.3%,
to $1.6 million during 2003, compared to $0.7 million during 2002,
primarily due to bad debt expense at SVB Alliant.

Client services expense related to loans and deposits
increased overall by $0.5 million, or 24.5%, to $2.7 million during 2003,
compared to $2.2 million during 2002.

Advertising and promotion expense increased by $0.4
million, or 32.3%, to $1.4 million during 2003, compared to $1.0 million during
2002, primarily due to additional marketing collateral related to new business
initiatives.

Insurance and protection
expense increased by $0.3 million, or 42.5%, to $1.2 million during 2003,
compared to $0.9 million during 2002, primarily due to higher market premiums
for the Company’s insurance coverage.


Minority Interest
in Net Gains (Losses) of Consolidated Affiliates

Investment gains or losses related to our managed
funds (see Part II, Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note
7. Investments Securities) are included in our consolidated noninterest income.
Minority interest in the net gains or losses of these consolidated managed
funds primarily represent net investment gains or losses and management fees
expense attributable to the minority interest holders in these managed funds.

The
change from net minority interest losses in 2003 to net minority gains in 2004
is primarily attributable to the improved investment returns from two of our
managed funds SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP and Silicon Valley BancVentures,
LP.

Income Taxes

2004 Compared to

Our effective income tax
rate was 37.8% in 2004, compared to 21.0% in 2003. The increase in our
effective tax rate between 2004 and 2003 was primarily attributable to higher
pre-tax income. The lower tax rate in 2003 was primarily attributable to a
higher impact of our federally tax-exempt municipal bond and tax credit funds
on overall pre-tax income.

2003 Compared to

Our effective income tax rate was 21.0% in 2003,
compared to 33.4% in 2002. The decrease in our effective tax rate from 2002 to
2003 was primarily due to a higher impact of our tax-advantaged investments on
our lower overall earnings, partially offset by the exclusion of REIT tax
benefits.

In the third quarter of 2002, we implemented
California Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) to serve as a future-funding
vehicle. In 2002 we obtained $0.8 million in tax benefits from the REIT
structure. In 2003, we did not take any REIT tax benefits in response to a
California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) announcement on December 31, 2003,
which related to new tax shelter regulations. We believe we are appropriately
reserved for prior year benefits that were previously recognized. We will not
reflect REIT tax benefits in our future financial statements until this matter
has been resolved with the California FTB. We believe that our position with
regard to the REIT has merit, and we plan to pursue our tax claims and defend
our use of this entity. For further information on our effective tax rate, see
Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 17.
Income Taxes.

On September 11, 2002,
California enacted a law requiring large banks (those with average assets in
excess of $500 million) to conform to federal law with respect to accounting
for bad debts. Prior to the law change, all banks, regardless of size, were
eligible to use the reserve method of accounting for bad debts which enabled
them to take deductions for anticipated bad debt losses prior to the losses
being incurred for California tax purposes. With the change, large banks may
now only deduct actual charge-offs net of recoveries in determining their
California taxable income. Banks that are required to conform to the new law
must include in taxable income 50 percent of their existing bad debt reserves
as of the end of the prior tax year. As a concession for requiring large banks
to comply with the new law, recapture of the remaining 50 percent of the
reserve is waived thereby creating a permanent tax benefit. Our one-time tax
benefit resulting from the law change was $0.8 million and was reflected in our
income tax expense for 2002. This change, while reducing income tax expense,
also resulted in accelerated tax payments.


Operating Segment Results

In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, we report segment
information based on the “management” approach. The management approach
designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and
assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Please refer to
the discussion of our segment organization in the Business Overview in Item 1.

Our primary source of
revenue is from net interest income. Accordingly, our segments are reported
using net interest income. We also evaluate performance based on noninterest
income and noninterest expense, which are presented as components of segment
operating profit or loss. We do not allocate income taxes to our segments. Additionally,
our management reporting model is predicated on average asset balances
therefore, it is not possible to provide period end asset balances for segment
reporting purposes. Our segment information at and for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, are as follows:

Commercial Banking

Year Ended December 31,
2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Net Income (Loss)
Before Taxes

Commercial Banking’s income before income taxes for
2004 of $67.8 million represented an increase of $1.0 million, or 1.5%, from
$66.9 million for 2003. This increase was the net result of higher revenues of
$28.6 million, comprised of higher net interest income of $18.3 million and
higher noninterest income of $10.3 million, offset by higher noninterest
expenses of $24.9 million.

Net interest income of $170.1 million for 2004
increased $18.3 million, or 12.0%, from $151.8 million for 2003. Higher loans and
deposit volumes along with higher interest rates drove this increase.

Recovery of provision for loan losses of $2.4 million
for 2004 represented a net change of approximately $2.7 million from $(0.4)
million for 2003.

Noninterest income of $66.1 million for 2004 increased
$10.3 million, or 18.5%, from $55.8 million for 2003. The increase was
primarily driven by letter of credit and foreign exchange income, which
increased $4.6 million; collateral monitoring fees of $2.3 million, which in
2003 was not reported as part of Commercial Bank; and cash management sweep
fees, which increased $2.2 million. Higher volume of client exchange
transactions resulted from increased global economic activity associated with
our clients’ markets.

Noninterest expense of $166.0
million for 2004 increased $24.9 million, or 17.6%, from $141.1 million for
2003. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily driven by expense
related to compensation and benefits and business development. Specifically,
incentive compensation increased $4.1 million, base compensation increased $2.1
million, and other employee-related expenses increased $2.1 million. Business
development and travel expense increased by $1.2 million related to strategic
initiatives such as the sponsorship of the SVB Tech Forum in San Francisco in
the third quarter of 2004 and the global expansion initiatives. Noninterest
expenses related to units supporting Commercial Bank activities were also
allocated to Commercial Bank. Increases in incentive compensation expenses
related to the support units also contributed to the expense increase.


Financial Condition

Commercial Banking had an
increase in average deposits of $622.8 million, or 23.9%, and an increase in
average loans of $128.2 million, or 8.5%, during 2004 compared to 2003. The
loan products with the largest growth were accounts receivable factoring, which
increased by $68.1 million, and asset-based lending, which grew by $41.4
million. The increase in average deposits and average loans reflect an improved
funding environment for our venture capital-backed commercial clients and other
market factors. Additionally, we are engaged in various marketing initiatives
to attract and retain commercial clients at all stages of growth.

Year Ended December 31,
2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002

Net Income (Loss)
Before Taxes

Commercial Banking’s income before income taxes for
2003 of $66.9 million represented a decrease of $3.9 million, or 5.5%, from
$70.8 million for 2002. This decrease was the result of lower revenues of $7.0 million
higher expense of $2.8 million partially offset by lower charge-offs of $5.9
million. The lower revenues were comprised of lower net interest income of $2.1
million and lower noninterest income of $4.9 million.

Net interest income of $151.8 million for 2003
decreased $2.1 million, or 1.4%, from $154.0 million for 2002. The transfer
rates on deposits drove the decrease in net interest income, partially offset
by an increase in deposit balances.

Recovery of provision for loan losses of $(0.4)
million for 2003 represented a net change of approximately $5.9 million, from
$5.6 million for 2002. Commercial Banking benefited from a large recovery
related to entertainment loan litigation settlements in the third quarter of
2003.

Noninterest income of $55.8 million for 2003 decreased
$4.9 million, or 8.1%, from $60.7 million for 2002. Client investment fees,
which decreased $6.5 million, and letter of credit and foreign exchange income,
which decreased $4.4 million, primarily drove the decrease. These decreases
were offset by cash management account fees, which increased by $3.6 million,
and other noninterest income, which increased by $2.1 million.

Noninterest expense of
$141.1 million for 2003 increased $2.8 million, or 2.0%, from $138.3 million for
2002. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily driven by compensation
and benefits expense. Incentive compensation expense increased at Commercial
Bank as did the cost of the support units supporting growing business
activities with Commercial Banking.

Financial Condition

Commercial Banking had an
increase in average deposits of $162.1 million, or 6.6%. The increase in
average deposits reflected an improved funding environment for our venture
capital-backed commercial clients and other market factors. Additionally, we
engaged in various marketing initiatives to attract and retain commercial
clients at all stages of growth.

SVB Capital

Year Ended December 31,
2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Net Income (Loss)
Before Taxes

SVB Capital’s income before taxes for 2004 of $7.3
million represented a $1.2 million, or 19.1% increase, compared to $6.1 million
for 2003. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in interest
income and noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest
expense.


Net interest income for 2004 of $12.5 million
represented a $0.7 million increase, or 5.6%, from $11.8 million for 2003.
The increase was primarily attributable to a favorable $1.3 million volume
variance related to loans and deposit balances. The increase was partially
offset by an unfavorable rate variance of $0.6 million. The rate variance
represents the impact of the interest rate on loans and deposits, net of the
transfer pricing.

Noninterest income for 2004 of $14.8 million represented
a $5.1 million, or 52.7% increase, from $9.7 million for 2003. The
increase was primarily a result of gains on securities and increased income
from warrants. The timing and amount of income from the disposition of client
warrants typically depends on factors beyond our control, including the general
condition of the public equity markets as well as the merger and acquisition
environment. We therefore cannot predict the timing and amount of warrant
related income with any degree of accuracy, and it is likely to vary materially
from period to period.

Investment
gains or losses related to our managed funds, (see Part II, Item 8,
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 7. Investments
Securities), are included in our consolidated noninterest income. Minority
interest in the net gains or losses of these consolidated managed funds
primarily represent net investment gains or losses and management fees expense
attributable to the minority interest holders in these managed funds.

The change from net minority interest losses in 2003
to net minority gains in 2004 is primarily attributable to the improved
investment returns from two of our managed funds SVB Strategic Investors Fund,
LP and Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP.

Noninterest expense for
2004 of $22.5 million represented a $5.1 million, or 29.5% increase from $17.4
million for 2003. The increase in noninterest expense is primarily attributed
to professional fees and compensation and benefits. Professional fees,
primarily related to fund management, increased by $2.3 million.
Compensation and benefits expense increased by $2.0 million resulting from
higher salary expense. We also incurred approximately $1.4 million in
professional fees related to fund raising activities associated with the Gold
Hill Venture Lending 03 Limited Partnership venture debt fund entities.

Financial Condition

SVB Capital had an
increase in average deposits of $46.8 million, or 9.1%, and average loans of
$10.4 million, or 15.5%, during 2004 compared to 2003. The growth in average
deposits and average loans was due to various market factors, including an
improved funds flow environment for SVB Capital’s client base, venture capital,
and private equity firms, as well as our initiatives to serve clients at all
states of growth.

Year Ended December 31,
2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002

Net Income (Loss)
Before Taxes

SVB Capital’s income before income taxes of $6.1
million for 2003 represented an increase of $4.5 million, or 284.1%, from
$1.6 million for 2002. This increase was the net result of higher revenues of
$21.5 million, comprised of higher net interest income of $11.8 million and
higher noninterest income of $9.7 million, offset by higher noninterest
expenses of $17.4 million.

Net interest income of $11.8 million for 2003
increased $1.2 million, or 10.9%, from $10.6 million for 2002. The increase was
primarily attributable to a favorable $0.9 million favorable volume variance
related to loans and deposit balances

,

and $0.3 million favorable rate variance. The rate variance represents the
impact of the interest rate on loans and deposits, net of the transfer pricing.

Noninterest income of $9.7 million for 2003 increased
$7.0 million, or 256.9%, from $2.7 million for 2002.  The increase primarily related to warrant
income gains of $7.5 million compared to $1.7 million for the same period in
2002.


Noninterest expense of
$17.4 million for 2003 increased $3.6 million, or 26.0%, from $13.8 million for
2002. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily driven by allocated
expense from units supporting business expansion within SVB Capital. Higher
incentive compensation expenses at the support units were a prime contributor
to the increased allocated costs.

Financial Condition

SVB Capital had an increase
in average deposits of $53.5 million, or 11.6%, and an increase in average
loans of $4.5 million, or 7.2%, during 2004 compared to 2003. The growth in
average deposits and average loans was due to various market factors, including
an improved funds flow environment for SVB Capital’s client base, venture
capital, and private equity firms, as well as our initiatives to serve clients
at all states of growth.

SVB Alliant

Year Ended December 31,
2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Net Income (Loss)
Before Taxes

SVB Alliant’s loss before income taxes of $(3.0)
million for 2004 represented a $59.6 million improvement, compared to a $(62.6)
million loss for 2003. The increase was primarily a result of goodwill
impairment charges of $63.0 million in 2003.

Noninterest income of $21.9 million in 2004
represented an increase of $8.8 million, or 66.7%, compared to $13.2 million in
2003. The increase was primarily attributable to one single large transaction,
which generated $6.1 million in fees in the second quarter of 2004.

Noninterest expense of
$24.9 million in 2004 represented a decrease of $50.8 million, compared to
$75.8 million for 2003. The decrease was primarily due to impairment of
goodwill charges of $17.0 million and $46.0 million incurred during the second
and fourth quarter of 2003, respectively. This was partially offset by
increases in compensation and benefits expense of $10.9 million. Of this
increase, $6.9 million was attributable to increased incentive compensation,
$1.6 million was attributable to increased base compensation, $1.2 million was
attributable to increased employee benefits, and $0.9 million was attributable
to increased stock-based compensation expense.

Financial Condition

SVB Alliant’s average
total assets were lower for 2004 due to impairment charges of goodwill of $17.0 million
and $46.0 million recorded in the second and fourth quarter of 2003,
respectively. Please see Item 8—Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Date—Note
6. Goodwill for further discussion.

Year Ended December 31,
2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002

Net Income (Loss)
Before Taxes

SVB Alliant’s loss before tax of $(62.6) million for
2003 represented a decrease of $65.1 million, from pre-tax income of $2.4
million for 2002. This decrease was primarily a result of goodwill impairment
charges of $63.0 million in 2003.

Noninterest income of $13.2 million for 2003 increased
$1.0 million, or 8.6%, from $12.1 million for 2002.


Noninterest expense of
$75.8 million for 2003 represented an increase of $66.1 million, compared to
$9.7 million for 2002. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily driven
by expenses related to charges for impairment of goodwill of $17.0 million and
$46.0 million incurred during the second and fourth quarter of 2003,
respectively. In addition, compensation and benefits expense also increased by
$2.0 million in 2003.

Balance Sheet
Analysis

SVB Alliant’s average
total assets were lower for 2003 due to the reduction in goodwill resulting
from the $17.0 million and $46.0 million impairment of goodwill charges
recorded in the second and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively. Please see Item 8—Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Date—Note
6. Goodwill for further discussion.

Private Client
Services and Other

The private Client Services and Other segment,
principally consists of our Private Client Services group, and other business
service units that are not part of the Commercial Bank, SVB Capital or SVB
Alliant segments. The Private Client Services Group does not meet the separate
reporting thresholds as defined by SFAS No. 131 and as such has been
combined with other business service units for segment reporting purposes. The
Private Client Services group provides a wide range of credit services to high-net-worth
individuals using both long-term secured and short-term unsecured lines of
credit. Those products and services include home equity lines of credit,
secured lines of credit, restricted stock purchase loans, airplane loans, and
capital call lines of credit. We also provide our clients with deposit account
products and services to meet cash management needs, including checking
accounts, deposit accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit.
Through our subsidiary, Woodside Asset Management, Inc., we provide
individual clients with personal investment advisory services, assisting
clients in establishing and implementing investment strategies to meet their
individual needs and goals. Woodside Asset Management, Inc. incurred a
$1.9 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter ended September 30,
2004. The Private Client Services Group was known as the Private Banking Group
until its name change in January 2004.

The other business services units provide various
products and services. The Private Client Services and Other segment also
reflects those adjustments necessary to reconcile the results of operating
segments based on the Company’s internal profitability reporting process to the
interim unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with
U.S generally accepted accounting principles applicable to consolidated
financial statements.

Net interest income of
$52.2 million for 2004 increased $26.9 million, or 106.7%, from $25.2 million
for 2003. The increase in net interest income is primarily attributed to an
increase of $25.0 million related to an increased gap between the funds
transfer rates utilized for profitability reporting and the realized earnings
on the investment portfolio.

Financial Condition

Our total assets were $5.2 billion at December 31,
2004, an increase of $673.6 million, or 15.0%, compared to $4.5 billion at December 31,
2003.

The growth in our total
assets was primarily funded by an increase in client deposits, which increased
by $552.6 million, or 15.1% over the period. The increase in total assets was
largely concentrated in investment securities and loans.


Federal Funds Sold
and Securities Purchased under Agreement to Resell

Federal funds sold and
securities purchased under agreement to resell totaled a combined $166.3 million
at December 31, 2004, a decrease of $376.2 million, or 69.3% as compared
to $542.5 million outstanding at the prior year end. The lower levels of
federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell at December 31,
2004, as compared to the prior year end reflects our current strategy of
investing available funds in high quality, fixed income investment securities
while maintaining adequate sources of liquidity. Our plan is to continue the
trend of managing federal funds sold and overnight repurchase agreements at
appropriate levels.

Investment
Securities

Investment securities totaled $2.3 billion at December 31,
2004, an increase of $682.8 million, or 43.3%, from December 31, 2003. The
increase was largely attributable to collateralized-mortgage obligations and
mortgage-backed securities, which collectively increased by $500.5 million and
asset-backed securities, which increased by $63.3 million. See Item 8.
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7. Investment
Securities.

For a description of the accounting policies related
to Investment Securities, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and
Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2.
Significant Accounting Policies—Investment Securities.


The
following table details the composition of investment securities, which were
classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value, with the exception
of non-marketable securities that include Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home
Loan Bank stock, tax credit funds, venture capital fund investments, and other
private equity investments, which were reported on a cost basis less any
identified impairment or reported at fair value using investment company
accounting rules at December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002.

(1)

Available-for-sale other equity investments included $0
million, $8.6 million, and $7.1 million related to investments owned by two

Taurus Growth Partners, LP and Libra Partners, L.P funds were liquidated and
the funds were fully distributed as of December 2004. We had a controlling
interest of less than 1% in the funds.

(2)

Marketable equity securities (investment company
accounting) included $0.5 million related to Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP,
at December 31, 2004. The Company has a controlling interest of 10.7% in
the fund. Excluding the minority interest-owned portion of Silicon Valley
BancVentures, LP, the Company has marketable equity securities (investment
company accounting) of $0.1 million as of December 31, 2004.

(3)

(investment company accounting) included $45.3 million, $30.1 million, and
$22.1 million related to our fund of funds, SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP,
as of December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. We had a
controlling ownership interest of 11.1% in the fund. It also included $7.3
million and $0.0 million related to SVB Strategic Investors Fund II, LP, at December 31,
2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. We had a controlling interest of
14.4% in the fund. Excluding the minority interest owned portion of these
funds, we had non-marketable venture capital fund investments (investment
company accounting) of $6.1 million, $3.3 million, and $2.4 million as of December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(4)

Non-marketable other private equity investments
(investment company accounting) included $15.7 million, $10.1 million, and
$10.0 million related to our venture capital fund, Silicon Valley BancVentures,
LP, as of December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. We had a
controlling ownership interest of 10.7% in the fund. Excluding the minority
interest owned portion of Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP, we had
non-marketable other private equity investments (investment company accounting)
of $1.7 million as of December 31, 2004 and $1.1 million each as of December 31,
2003 and 2002.

(5)

Non-marketable other investments (investment company
accounting) included $9.0 million related to Partners for Growth, LP at December 31,
2004. We had a majority ownership interest of 53.2% in the fund. It also
included $2.4 million and $2.3 million related to Gold Hill Venture Lending
Partners 03, LLC and Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP, respectively, as of December 31,
2004. We had a majority interest of 90.7% in Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners
03, LLC. Excluding the minority interest owned portion of Partners for Growth,
LP and Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners 03, LLC, we had non-marketable other
investments (investment company accounting) of $9.2 million as of December 31,
2004.

(6)

Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and Federal Reserve
Bank (“FRB”) stock are restricted, as we are required to hold shares of FHLB
and FRB stock under the Bank’s borrowing agreement.


2004 Compared to

Available-for-Sale
Investments

Available-for-sale
investment securities totaled $2.1 billion at December 31, 2004, an
increase of $632.9 million, or 42.8%, from the December 31, 2003 balance
of $1.5 billion. This increase primarily resulted from a shift of funds from
federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell to the
available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Furthermore, excess
liquidity generated by growth in deposits in excess of loan growth was invested
in the available-for-sale investment portfolio. The increase in available for
sale securities was concentrated in higher-yielding mortgage-backed securities
and collateralized mortgage obligations. During 2004, we increased the duration
of the fixed income investment portfolio to 2.1 years at December 31, 2004
from 1.7 years at December 31, 2003, in conjunction with our active
interest rate risk management program. Commercial paper, money market mutual
funds and asset-backed securities also increased, which was partially offset by
a decrease in obligations of states and political subdivisions.

Non-Marketable
Equity Securities

The increase in the other investments category of
non-marketable securities was related to investments in two venture debt funds.
Additionally, venture capital funds and other private equity investments
increased due to increases in the market value of certain investments in our
managed funds SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP and Silicon Valley BancVentures,
LP, and further investments made into our managed funds.

Based on December 31, 2004 market valuations, we
had $5.6 million in unrealized pre-tax warrant gains. We are restricted from
exercising many of these warrants until later in 2005. As of December 31,
2004, we directly held 1,902 warrants in 1,362 companies and made investments,
through our managed investment funds, in 300 venture capital funds, 40
companies, and two venture debt funds.

Additionally, we have an investment in a specific
fund, which is being carried as a cost basis investment. The carrying value of
our cost basis investment in that fund at December 31, 2004 does not
include an unrealized gain of approximately $2.1 million based on the market
valuation of the specific fund investment.

We are typically contractually precluded from taking
steps to hedge any current unrealized gains associated with many of these
equity instruments. Hence, the amount of income realized by us from these
equity instruments in future periods might vary materially from the current
unrealized amount due to fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying
common stock of these companies.

At December 31, 2004,
except for securities issued by the U.S. Government or by U.S. government
agencies and corporations, we held no investment securities that were issued by
a single party that exceeded 10.0% of our stockholders’ equity.

2003 Compared to

Available-for-Sale
Investments

Available-for-sale
investment securities totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2003, an
increase of $35.2 million, or 2.4%, from the December 31, 2002,
balance of $1.4 billion. The increase in available-for-sale securities resulted
from growth in average client deposits in excess of loan growth. The change in
the composition of investments was the result of our continuing efforts to
diversify the product mix in our investment portfolio to higher yielding, high-
quality assets. Short-term money market mutual funds were reallocated to higher
yielding mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. We
added some duration to the portfolio due to active interest rate risk
management and increased the


average
life to 1.7 years in 2003 from 1.5 years in 2002. Other notable changes
included the reduction of short-term municipal bonds and an increase in agency
discount notes and debentures.

Non-Marketable
Securities (Investment Company Accounting)

The increase in non-marketable securities related to
an increase in venture capital fund investments of $8.1 million between 2002
and 2003, primarily due to additional investments made by our managed fund, SVB
Strategic Investors, LP during the year.

The following table
provides the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully
taxable-equivalent yields on investment securities as of December 31,
2004, except for auction rate securities that use the next reset date as the
maturity date. The weighted-average yield is computed using the amortized cost
of available-for-sale securities, which are reported at fair value. Expected
remaining maturities of callable U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed
securities, and collateralized mortgage obligations may differ significantly
from their contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay
obligations with or without penalties. This is most apparent in mortgage-backed
securities and collateralized mortgage obligations as contractual maturities
are typically 15 to 30 years whereas expected average lives of these securities
are significantly shorter. Warrant securities, venture capital fund
investments, other private equity investments, Federal Reserve Bank stock,
Federal Home Loan Bank stock, and tax credit funds were included in the table
below as maturing after 10 years.

Investment Securities—Remaining Contractual Principal
Maturities

Callable U.S. agency
securities, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage obligations
pose risks not associated with fixed maturity bonds, primarily related to the
ability of the borrower to call or prepay the debt with or without penalty. This
risk, known as call risk and prepayment risk, may result in these securities
having longer or shorter average lives than anticipated at the time of purchase.
As interest rates decline, prepayments generally tend to increase; causing the
average expected remaining maturity to


shorten.
Conversely, as interest rates rise, prepayments tend to decrease causing the
average expected remaining maturity to extend.

Loans

The
following table details the composition of the loan portfolio, net of unearned
income for each year ended December 31:


The
following table sets forth the remaining contractual maturity distribution of
our gross loans at December 31, 2004, for fixed and variable rate loans:

Upon maturity, loans satisfying our credit quality
standards may be eligible for renewal. Such renewals are subject to the normal
underwriting and credit administration practices associated with new loans. We
do not grant loans with unconditional extension terms.

A substantial percentage
of our loans are commercial in nature, and such loans are generally made to
emerging- growth or corporate technology companies in a variety of industries. As
of December 31, 2004, our software tools and applications industry
subsector represented 16.1% of total gross loans, our premium wine industry
sector represented 14.2% of total gross loans our venture capital industry
subsector represented 13.2% of total gross loans, and our private client
services sector represented 11.2% of total


gross
loans. No other industry sector represented more than 10.0% of total gross
loans at December 31, 2004.

Loan Administration

Authority over our loan policies resides with our
board of directors. This authority is managed through the approval and periodic
review of our loan policies. The board of directors delegates authority to the
directors’ loan committee to supervise our loan underwriting, approval, and
monitoring activities. The directors’ loan committee consists of outside board
of director members and our chief executive officer, who serves as an
alternate.

Subject to the oversight
of the directors’ loan committee, lending authority is delegated to the chief
credit officer and our management loan committee, which consists of the chief
executive officer, chief credit officer, chief banking officer, chief strategy
officer, and other senior members of our lending management. Requests for new
and existing credits that meet certain size and underwriting criteria may be
approved outside of our internal loan committee by designated senior lenders or
jointly with a senior credit officer.

Represents loan type as a
percentage of total loans as of year end.

The allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $37.6
million at December 31, 2004, a decrease of $12.2 million, or 24.6%,
as compared to $49.9 million at December 31, 2003. Our strong credit
quality necessitated a decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses. This
decrease was due to net charge-offs of $2.3 million and a provision for loan
and lease losses of $(9.9) million. The 2004 net charge-off amount was composed
of $16.6 million in gross charge-offs and $14.2 million in gross recoveries.

The allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $49.9
million at December 31, 2003, a decrease of $8.5 million, or 14.6%,
as compared to $58.4 million at December 31, 2002. Our improved credit
quality necessitated a decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses. This
decrease was due to net recoveries of $0.2 million and a provision for loan
losses of $(8.7) million. Our loan recoveries in 2003 included settlement of
the remaining recovery of film loan litigation. The 2003 net recovery amount
was composed of $20.1 million in gross charge-offs and $20.4 million in gross
recoveries.

The allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $58.4
million at December 31, 2002, an increase of $1.5 million, or 2.6%,
as compared to $56.9 million at December 31, 2001. This decrease was due
to net charge-offs of $5.8 million and a provision for loan losses of $7.2
million. Our loan recoveries in 2002 primarily related to film loans, which
were charge off in 2000. The 2002 net charge-off amount was composed of $27.9
million in gross charge-offs and $22.2 million in gross recoveries.

The allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $56.9
million at December 31, 2001, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 1.9%,
compared to $58.0 million at December 31, 2000. This decrease was due to
net charge-offs of $18.1 million offset by additional provisions to the
allowance for loan and lease losses of $17.0 million. The 2001 gross
charge-offs included one entertainment credit totaling $3.8 million. Of the
total 2001 gross charge-offs, $4.9 million were classified as nonperforming
loans at the end of 2000. The 2001 gross recoveries included three credits, one
from our technology industry sector and two from our discontinued entertainment
and healthcare niches, totaling $12.0 million.

The allowance for loan and
lease losses totaled  $58.0 at December 31,
2000. Gross charge-offs in 2000 included three entertainment credits totaling
$23.1 million and two commercial credits totaling $12.0 million in 2000 in our
healthcare services industry sector. Of the total 2000 gross charge-offs, $13.4
million were classified as nonperforming loans at the end of 1999.

Nonperforming
Assets

Nonperforming
assets consist of loans that are past due 90 days or more that are still
accruing interest, loans on nonaccrual status, other real estate owned (OREO),
and other foreclosed assets. We held no


OREO or other foreclosed assets at December 31,
2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, or 2000. The table below sets forth certain data and
ratios between nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets, and the allowance for
loan and lease losses. At December 31 
2003 and 2002, our nonaccrual loans represented all impaired loans. We
measure all loans placed on nonaccrual status for impairment based on the fair
value of the underlying collateral or the net present value of the expected
cash flows in accordance with SFAS No. 114, “Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan.”  For all periods
presented, nonperforming loans equaled nonperforming assets.

Nonaccrual Loans

The
detailed composition of nonaccrual loans is presented in the following table.

Nonperforming Loans

Nonperforming loans totaled $14.9 million at December 31,
2004, an increase of $2.6 million, or 21.0%, from the $12.4 million total
at December 31, 2003, however, nonperforming loans remained at 0.6% of
total gross loans. The relatively low levels of non-performing loans at December 31,
2004 and 2003 reflect an improved economic environment experienced by our
clients as well as our ability to effectively manage client credit risk through
our strategic focus on the technology, life science, premium wine, and private
equity industries. Of the total nonperforming loans at year end 2003, $1.1
million were charged off, $5.9 million remained on nonperforming status, and
$5.4 million were returned to accrual status or repaid during 2004. Additionally,
$9.0 million in loans were placed on nonperforming status during 2004 and were
still classified as nonperforming loans at December 31, 2004.

Nonperforming loans totaled $12.4 million at December 31,
2003, a decrease of $8.1 million, or 39.5%, from the $20.4 million total
at December 31, 2002. The reduction in non-performing loans reflected the
improved economic conditions experienced by our clients as well as our ability
to manage client credit risk through our strategic focus on the technology,
life science, premium wine, and private equity industries. Of the total
nonperforming loans at year end 2002, $2.3 million were charged off, $1.2
million


remained on nonperforming
status, and $16.9 million were repaid during 2003. Additionally, $11.2 million
in loans were placed on nonperforming status during 2003 and were still
classified as nonperforming loans at December 31, 2003.

Nonperforming loans totaled $20.4 million at December 31,
2002, an increase of $2.1 million, or 11.5%, from the $18.3 million total
at December 31, 2001. Of the total nonperforming loans at year end 2001,
$8.4 million were charged off, $1.6 million remained on nonperforming status,
$8.0 million were repaid during 2002, and $0.3 million were upgraded to
performing status. Additionally, $15.8 million in loans were placed on
nonperforming status during 2002 and were still classified as nonperforming
loans at the end of 2002.

If the impaired loans for 2004, 2003 and 2002 had not
been impaired, $1.1 million, $1.0 million and $1.3 million in interest income
would have been realized during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

In addition to the loans
disclosed in the foregoing analysis as of December 31, 2004, we have
identified three loans with principal amounts aggregating approximately $6.6
million, that, on the basis of information known to us, were judged to have a
higher than normal risk of becoming nonperforming. We are not aware of any
other loans where known information about possible problems of the borrower
casts serious doubts about the borrower’s ability to comply with the loan
repayment terms.

Goodwill

Goodwill totaled $35.6
million at December 31, 2004 compared to $37.5 million at December 31,
2003. The decrease in goodwill was due to an impairment of goodwill charge
incurred pertaining to the entire goodwill balance of Woodside Asset Management, Inc.
All of the Company’s goodwill at December 31, 2004 pertains to the
acquisition of SVB Alliant.

SVB Alliant

During the second and fourth quarters of 2004, we used
a consulting firm to conduct an impairment review of SVB Alliant in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, based primarily on forecasted
discounted cash flow analyses. The valuation analysis of SVB Alliant for each
review indicated no further impairment beyond that already identified and
recorded.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, it became apparent
that the operating results of SVB Alliant during the second half of 2003 were
substantially below the performance forecasted in connection with the second
quarter analysis, primarily due to decreased fees associated with weak initial
public offering (IPO) and mergers and acquisitions environments. We engaged the
same business-consulting firm that assisted us with the annual impairment
review during the second quarter of 2003 to assist us in conducting a valuation
of SVB Alliant, in compliance with the requirements of SFAS No. 142. Based
on this valuation, we recorded an impairment charge of $46.0 million during the
fourth quarter of 2003. The total impairment charge for 2003 was $63.0 million.

During
the second quarter of 2003, we conducted an annual impairment review of SVB
Alliant, which elicited an indication of possible impairment. Despite an
increase in revenues during the second quarter of 2003 compared to the first
quarter of 2003, SVB Alliant failed to achieve the revenues projected by the
financial model used to value it in connection with its original acquisition by
us. In response to these indications, we engaged an internationally reputable
business consulting firm to assist us in a valuation of SVB Alliant, in
compliance with the requirements of SFAS No. 142. Based on this valuation,
we recorded an impairment charge of $17.0 million during the second quarter of
2003.


Woodside Asset
Management, Inc.

During the third quarter
of 2004, we conducted an annual impairment review of Woodside Asset Management, Inc.,
which indicated possible impairment. Based primarily on an internal analysis of
forecasted discounted cash flows, we recorded an impairment charge for the
entire goodwill amount of $1.9 million during the third quarter of 2004. Woodside
Asset Management, Inc. failed to achieve or exceed the projected operating
results used as the basis of its valuation in connection with our original
acquisition of the business.

Deposits

Our
deposits are largely obtained from clients within our technology, life science,
private equity, and premium wine industry sectors and, to a lesser extent, from
individuals served by private client services. We do not obtain deposits from
conventional retail sources and have no brokered deposits. The following table
presents the composition of our deposits for the last five years ended December 31:

Total deposits were $4.2 billion at December 31,
2004, an increase of $552.6 million, or 15.1%, from the prior year end total of
$3.7 billion. The increase in client deposits was concentrated in noninterest
bearing demand deposits and reflects our efforts to penetrate the corporate
technology industry sector, an improved venture capital funding environment,
and our various initiatives to drive business.

Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased as a
percentage of total deposits to 62.8% at December 31, 2004 from 59.6% at December 31,
2003. At December 31, 2004, we held overdraft balances of $8.5 million,
which were included in commercial loans.

Total deposits were $3.7 billion at December 31,
2003, an increase of $230.7 million, or 6.7%, from the prior year-end total of
$3.4 billion. The increase in deposits reflected an improved funding
environment, increased venture capital fund activity, and our various
initiatives to drive business. Our noninterest-bearing demand deposits
increased $294.2 million, or 15.6%, and money market deposits increased $147.3
million or 15.8%. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in time
deposits of $210.1 million, or 35.7% from the prior year end.

Total deposits were $3.4 billion at December 31,
2002, an increase of $55.2 million, or 1.6%, from the prior year end total of
$3.4 billion. Although our total period-end client deposit balances remained
fairly consistent between 2002 and 2001, we experienced a shift in the
composition of deposit balances. Our noninterest bearing demand deposits increased
$154.5 million, or 8.9%, and money market deposits increased $38.3 million or
4.3%. These increases were largely offset by a decrease in time deposits of
$133.7 million, or 18.5% from the prior year end.

Total deposits were $3.4 billion at December 31, 2001,
a decrease of $1.5 billion, or 30.5%, from the prior year end total of $4.9
billion. A substantial portion of the decrease in deposits during 2001 was
concentrated in our noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which decreased $711.1
million, or 29.0%, and bonus money market deposits, which decreased $534.5
million or 45.9%, from the prior year end. This


decrease was explained by
a slowdown in our clients’ capital markets and venture capital funding that
reduced our clients’ liquidity levels at December 31, 2001.

The
aggregate amount of time deposit accounts individually exceeding $100,000
totaled $286.7 million at December 31, 2004, and $333.6 million at December 31,
2003. At December 31, 2004, substantially all time deposit accounts
exceeding $100,000 were scheduled to mature within one year. No material
portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss
of any one depositor would not materially affect our business.

Borrowings

Contingently
Convertible Debt

On May 20, 2003, we
issued $150.0 million of zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes at face
value, due June 15, 2008, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act of 1933 and outside the United States to non-US
persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The notes are
convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of $33.6277 per share
and are subordinated to all our present and future senior debt. Holders of the
notes may convert their notes only under certain conditions. Please see

Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 12. Borrowings for additional discussion.

Junior Subordinated
Debentures

On October 30, 2003,
we issued $51.5 million in 7.0% junior subordinated debentures. A portion of
the proceeds were used to complete an early redemption of the existing $40.0
million of 8.25% trust preferred securities. The remainder of the proceeds are
being used for general corporate purposes. For further information, see

Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 12. Borrowings.

Trust Preferred
Securities

In May 1998, we issued $40.0 million in
cumulative trust preferred securities through a newly formed special-purpose
trust, SVB Capital I. We completed the early redemption of these trust
preferred securities effective December 1, 2003. At the time of
redemption, the remaining unamortized issuance costs of $1.3 million
related to the trust preferred securities were expensed.

The trust was a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary
of Silicon Valley Bancshares and its sole assets were the junior subordinated
deferrable interest debentures. Distributions were cumulative and were payable
quarterly at a rate of 8.25% per annum of the stated liquidation amount of $25
per preferred security. We fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations
of the trust, on a subordinated basis.

On June 3, 2002, we entered
into an interest rate swap, which

hedged against the risk of changes in
fair values associated with our $40.0 million, 8.25% fixed rate trust preferred
securities. This agreement provided

a
benefit of $1.0 million and $1.1 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
swap was terminated


on June 23,
2003. For further information, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13. Derivative Financial
Instruments.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for the impact of adoption of SFAS No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both
Liabilities and Equity.”

Available Lines of
Credit

We currently have
available $304.0 million in federal funds and lines of credit, which were
unused at year end. In addition to the available federal funds lines the Bank
has reverse repurchase agreement lines available with multiple securities
dealers. Reverse repurchase lines allow the Bank to finance short term
borrowings using various fixed income securities as collateral. At December 31,
2004, the Bank had not borrowed against any of its reverse repurchase lines.

Capital Resources

Our management seeks to
maintain adequate capital to support anticipated asset growth and credit risks,
and to ensure that Bancshares and Silicon Valley Bank are in compliance with
all regulatory capital guidelines. Our primary sources of new capital include
the issuance of common stock, as well as retained earnings.

Common Stock

$160.0 million
share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors, effective May 7,

On May 7, 2003, we
announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of
up to $160.0 million. This program became effective immediately and replaced
previously announced stock repurchase programs. Under this program, we
repurchased in aggregate 0.3 million shares of common stock totaling $12.6
million in 2004. In 2003, we repurchased in aggregate 4.5 million shares of
common stock totaling $113.2 million. On May 20, 2003, we purchased 1.3
million shares of common stock for approximately $33.4 million in conjunction
with our convertible note offering. Additionally, during the second quarter of
2003, we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase (ASR) agreement for
approximately 3.2 million shares at an initial price of $79.9 million. We
completed our settlement obligations under this ASR agreement in the third
quarter of 2003. See below for terms of this agreement, which are substantially
the same as ASR agreements we entered into in January 2003 and November 2002.

$100.0 million
share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on September 16,

From its inception through
its termination on May 7, 2003, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of
common stock totaling $94.3 million in conjunction with the $100.0 million
share repurchase program. Under this program, we repurchased 3.3 million shares
of common stock totaling $59.7 million during 2002. A portion of the share
repurchases under this program was completed under an ASR agreement; see below
for terms of the agreement.

$50.0 million share
repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on March 21, 2002

During 2002, we
repurchased 2.3 million shares of common stock totaling $50.2 million in
conjunction with this program.


Accelerated Stock
Repurchase Agreements

In May 2003, January 2003, and November 2002,
we entered into ASR agreements to facilitate the repurchase of shares of our
common stock. As of December 31, 2003, we had completed all of our
settlement obligations under these ASRs. We repurchased 3.2 million,
1.7 million, and 2.3 million shares of our common stock from the
counterparties for $79.9 million, $29.9 million, and
$40.0 million under the ASR agreements of May 2003, January 2003,
and November 2002, respectively. These agreements had a five-year term. During
the term of the agreements, we had an obligation to sell shares to the
counterparty equal to the number of shares we purchased from it at the outset
of the agreement. We had the option to fulfill our obligation either by buying
shares in the open market and selling those shares to the counterparty at
forward prices specified in the agreement or by issuing new shares and
remitting them to the counterparty in exchange for the forward price. The
forward price was based on a formula that began with the price of the initial
purchase and was adjusted for fees and commissions and the length of time from
the initial purchase to when shares were sold or delivered to the counterparty.
We had complete discretion as to the timing and number of shares that we sold
to the counterparty subject to a cumulative minimum of 20.0% by the end of each
year of the agreement. Under the ASRs, if we were required to pay the
Counterparty and elected to settle our obligation in shares, the number of
shares to be issued by us was capped.

We accounted for initial
payment under the ASR agreements as a purchase of treasury stock, and we
subsequently retired those shares. Prior to June 15, 2003, the effective
date of SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,” we accounted for ASRs under
the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 99-7, “Accounting for an
Accelerated Share Repurchase Program.” 
EITF No. 99-7 provided that an entity should account for an
accelerated stock repurchase program as two separate transactions:  (a) as shares of common stock acquired
in a treasury stock transaction recorded on the acquisition date and (b) as
a forward contract indexed to its own common stock. The forward contract was to
be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of EITF No. 00-19, “Accounting
for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a
Company’s Own Stock.”  As of December 31,
2003, we had fulfilled all its obligations under the ASR agreements in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 150.

Stockholders’
Equity

Stockholders’ equity totaled $532.3 million at December 31,
2004 an increase of $85.3 million, or 19.1%, from the $447.0 million
balance at December 31, 2003. This increase in 2004, as compared to 2003,
was primarily due to the net income of $65.4 million and stock issuances under
employee stock purchase and option program, partially offset by the repurchase
of 0.3 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $12.6
million. We have not paid a cash dividend on our common stock since 1992, and
we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31,
2004. As of December 31, 2004, there are no plans for payment of
dividends.

Funds generated through
retained earnings are a significant source of capital and liquidity and are
expected to continue to be so in the future. Our management engages in ongoing
capital planning process in an effort to make effective use of the capital
available to us. The capital plan considers capital needs for the foreseeable
future and allocates capital to both existing business activities and expected
future business activities. Expected future activities for which capital is set
aside include potential product expansions and acquisitions of new business
lines.

Credit Rating

Standard & Poor’s Rating Services assigned
Silicon Valley Bancshares its BBB- long-term counterparty credit in December 2003,
and there has been no change to that rating. Standard & Poor’s


assigned its BBB
counterparty credit rating to Silicon Valley Bank. An issuer rated BBB is
defined as having an adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments,
however, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitments.
According to Standard & Poor’s, the outlook for both Silicon Valley
Bancshares and Silicon Valley Bank is stable.

Silicon Valley Bancshares’
credit rating by Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) at December 31, 2004 was
Baa for issuer rating. According to Moody’s, issuers rated Baa offer adequate
financial security. However, certain protective elements may be lacking or may
be unreliable over any great period of time. Silicon Valley Bank’s credit
rating by Moody’s at December 31, 2003 was A3 for issuer rating, A3 for
long-term deposits, P-2 for short-term deposits, and C for financial strength. Moody’s
bank deposit ratings are opinions of a bank’s ability to repay punctually its
foreign and/or domestic currency deposit obligations. According to Moody’s an A
rating for deposits represents good credit quality, however, elements may be
present that suggest a susceptibility to impairment over the long-term. Banks
rated P-2 by Moody’s for short-term deposits offer strong credit quality and a
strong capacity for timely payment of short-term deposit obligations. Financial
strength ratings represent Moody’s opinion of a bank’s intrinsic safety and
soundness and, as such, exclude certain external credit risks and credit
support elements that are addressed by Moody’s bank deposit ratings. Banks
rated C possess adequate intrinsic financial strength and are typically
institutions with more limited but still valuable business franchises, good
financial fundamentals, and a predictable and stable operating environment. According
to Moody’s, the outlook for both Silicon Valley Bancshares and Silicon Valley
Bank is stable.

Liquidity

Another important objective of the asset/liability
management committee (ALCO) is to manage liquidity. The objective of liquidity
management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet
loan demand, to meet depositors’ needs, and to service other liabilities as
they become due without causing an undue amount of cost or risk and without
causing a disruption to normal operating conditions.

We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of
projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical
deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and
economic conditions, individual client funding needs, and existing and planned
business activities. Our ALCO provides oversight to the liquidity management
process and recommends policy guidelines, subject to our board of directors’
approval, and courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity
needs.

The ability to attract a stable, low-cost base of
deposits is our primary source of liquidity. We continue to expand on
opportunities to increase our liquidity. In the third quarter of 2002, we
became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco adding to our
liquidity channels. Other sources of liquidity available to us include federal
funds purchased, reverse repurchase agreements, and other short-term borrowing
arrangements. Our liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of our
portfolio of liquid assets. Our definition of liquid assets includes cash and
cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal
business operations, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale
agreements, investment securities maturing within six months, investment
securities eligible and available for financing or pledging purposes with a
maturity in excess of six months, and anticipated near-term cash flows from investments.

Our policy guidelines provide that liquid assets as a
percentage of total deposits should not fall below 20.0%. Our ratio of liquid
assets to total deposits was 47.6% and 48.6% at December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively, both well in excess of our minimum policy guidelines. In
addition to monitoring the level of liquid assets relative to total deposits,
we also utilize other policy measures in our liquidity management activities. As
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we were in compliance with all of these
policy measures.


On a stand-alone basis, Bancshares’ primary liquidity
channels include dividends from Silicon Valley Bank, its investment portfolio
assets, and its ability to raise debt and capital. The ability of Silicon
Valley Bank to pay dividends is subject to certain regulations; see
Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Restriction on Dividends.

In analyzing our liquidity for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
reference is made to our consolidated statement of cash flows for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002; see Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplemental Data. The statement of cash flows includes separate
categories for operating, investing, and financing activities.

Cash provided by operating activities for 2004 was $92.0
million, which included net income of $65.4 million. Adjustments for noncash
items included depreciation and amortization of $8.5 million and minority
interest in gains of consolidated affiliates of $3.1 million, offset primarily
by net gains on provisions for loan losses of $9.9 million, disposition of
client warrants of $9.2 million, and net investment gains of $5.6 million. Sources
of cash from changes in other assets and liabilities included increases in
accrued retention, warrant, and other incentive plans of $21.1 million and,
deferred rent liability of $7.3 million, with a decrease from deferred income
taxes of $6.4 million. These sources of cash were offset by increases in
accounts receivable of $7.3 million, which primarily relates to sales of equity
investments, and accrued interest receivable of $3.1 million.

Cash used for investing activities was $1.0 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net cash outflow was primarily
driven by purchases of investment securities of $12.0 billion, partially offset
by $6.2 billion in proceeds from the sale of investment securities and $5.2
billion in proceeds from maturities and pay-downs of investment securities. A
net increase in loans of $341.6 million also contributed to the net cash
outflow.

Cash provided by financing activities was $573.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2004, largely, driven by net
increases in deposits of $552.6 million. Proceeds from the issuance of common
stock and capital contributions from minority interest participants also
contributed $25.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively, to the overall cash
increase from our financing activities. These sources of cash were offset by
repurchases of our common stock of $12.6 million during 2004.

Cash and cash equivalents were $445.9 million at December 31,
2004.

Operating activities for 2003 included net income of
$12.0 million, which was adjusted for certain non-cash items including
impairment of goodwill, provision for loan losses, depreciation, deferred tax
assets, and an assortment of other miscellaneous items resulting in cash
generated from operations. Investing activities consisted of transactions in
investment securities resulting in a net cash outflow of $50.7 million and
the net change in total loans, which resulted in a net cash inflow of
$76.2 million in 2003. The net cash inflow related to loans relate to
principal collections offset by loan originations. The net cash outflow from
securities transactions was the net result of purchases of investment
securities, offset by securities maturities and sales. Financing activities
reflected cash inflows of $234.1 million primarily resulting from a large
increase in deposits and inflows from the issuance of zero-coupon convertible
notes and 7.0% junior subordinated debentures. Financing cash outflows resulted
from repurchases of common stock and redemption of our 8.25% trust preferred
securities. In total, the transactions noted above resulted in a net cash
inflow of $352.4 million for 2003 and total cash and cash equivalents, as
defined in our consolidated statement of cash flows, of $795.0 million at December 31,
2003.

Operating activities for
2002 included net income of $53.4 million, which was adjusted for certain
non-cash items including the provision for loan losses, depreciation, deferred
tax assets, and an assortment of other miscellaneous items resulting in cash
generated from operations. Investing activities consisted of transactions in
investment securities resulting in a net cash inflow of $296.2 million and the
net change in total loans, which resulted in a net cash outflow of $346.8
million in 2002. The net cash outflow from


securities
transactions were the net result of investment securities maturities and sales,
offset by purchases of securities. The net cash outflow related to loans
relates to loan originations offset by principal collections. Financing
activities reflected cash outflows of $109.4 million resulting from the
repurchase of common stock. Additionally, our total deposits increased by $55.2
million during 2002, and we received net cash proceeds received from issuance
of common stock totaling $9.8 million under the provisions of our employee
benefit plans. In total, the transactions resulted in a net cash inflow of $2.1
million for 2002 and total cash and cash equivalents, as defined in our
consolidated statement of cash flows, were $442.6 million at December 31,
2002.

Financial Ratios

The
table below presents the relationship between the following significant
financial ratios:

Both
Silicon Valley Bancshares’ and Silicon Valley Bank’s capital ratios were in
excess of regulatory guidelines for a well-capitalized depository institution
as of December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002. See Item 8. Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 22. Regulatory Matters. Capital ratios for Silicon
Valley Bancshares are set forth below:

We and Silicon Valley Bank’s capital ratios remained
well above the regulatory requirements in 2004. The decrease in total capital
from 2003 to 2004 was due to the declining eligibility of our convertible bond
as it approaches maturity. Both Tier 1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios increased due
to the earnings generated by us and Silicon Valley Bank and the nominal amount
of share repurchases executed over the course of the year.

The increases in our Tier 1 risk-based capital and
Tier 1 leverage ratios from 2003 to 2004 have been caused in large part to
increase in additional paid-in capital and retain earnings due to higher net
income in 2004 as compared to 2003.

The decreases in our Tier
1 risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios from 2002 to 2003 have been
caused in large part to reductions in additional paid in capital and retained
earnings due to our stock repurchases in 2003 and 2002.


Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

In the normal course of
business, we use financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the
financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include
commitments to extend credit, commercial and standby letters of credit, foreign
exchange options, and foreign exchange forward contracts. These instruments
involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. Credit risk is defined as
the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial
instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract.

Commitments to
Extend Credit

A commitment to extend
credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no
violation of any condition established in the agreement. Such commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates, or other termination clauses, and
usually require a fee paid by the client upon us issuing the commitment. Commitments
which are available for funding, due to clients meeting all collateral,
compliance, and financial covenants required under loan commitment agreements,
totaled $2.7 billion at December 31, 2004, and $1.7 billion at December 31,
2003. Out of these available commitments balances, the fixed rate commitments
were $257.2 million at December 31, 2004, and $167.9 million at December 31, 2003.
Our exposure arising from interest rate risk associated with fixed rate loan
commitments is not considered material. Commitments which are unavailable for funding,
due to clients not meeting all collateral, compliance, and financial covenants
required under loan commitment agreements, totaled $0.7 billion at December 31,
2004, and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2003. Our potential exposure to
credit loss, in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial
instrument, is the contractual amount of the available unused loan commitment. We
use the same credit approval and monitoring process in extending loan
commitments as we do in making loans. The actual liquidity needs or the credit
risk that we have experienced have historically been lower than the contractual
amount of commitments to extend credit because a significant portions of these
commitments expire without being drawn upon. We evaluate each potential
borrower and the necessary collateral on an individual basis. The type of
collateral varies but may include intellectual property, real property, bank
deposits or business and personal assets. The potential credit risk associated
with these commitments is considered in our evaluation of the adequacy of our
allowance for loan and lease losses. Additionally, we have aggregate maximum
lending limits of $478.7 million as of December 31, 2004 related to our
accounts receivable factoring arrangements. We extend credit under accounts
receivable factoring arrangements when our clients’ sales invoices are deemed
credit worthy under existing underwriting practices.

Commercial and
Standby Letters of Credits

Commercial and standby letters of credit represent
conditional commitments issued by us on behalf of a client to support the
performance of a client to a third party when certain specified future events
have yet to occur. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily for
inventory purchases by clients and are typically short term in nature. We
provide two types of standby letter of credit, performance and financial
standby letter of credits. Performance standby letters of credit are issued in
connection with the performance of a client to a third party when certain
specified future events have yet to occur. Performance standby letters of
credit are primarily used to support performance instruments such as bid bonds,
performance bonds, lease obligations, repayment of loans, and past due notices.
Financial standby letters of credit are conditional undertakings issued by us
in connection with the payment by a client to a third party (beneficiary).
Financial standby letters of credit are primarily used to support many types of
domestic and international payments. These standby letters of credit have fixed
expiration dates and generally require a fee paid by a client at the time we
issue the commitment. Fees generated from these standby letters of credit are
recognized in noninterest income over the commitment period.


The credit risk involved
in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with
extending loan commitments to clients, and accordingly, we use a credit
evaluation process and collateral requirements similar to those for loan commitments.
Our standby letters of credit often are cash secured by our clients. The actual
liquidity needs or the credit risk that we have experienced historically have
been lower than the contractual amount of letters of credit issued because a
significant portion of these conditional commitments expire without being drawn
upon.

Obligation Under
Guarantees

The
table below summarizes our standby letter of credits at December 31, 2004.
The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the amount that
could be lost under the standby letters of credit if there were a total default
by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under
recourse provisions or from the collateral held or pledged.

At December 31, 2004, the carrying amount of the
liabilities related to financial and performance standby letters of credit was
approximately $3.4 million. At December 31, 2004, cash and investment
securities collateral available to us to reimburse losses under financial and
performance standby letters of credits was $284.8 million.

In addition to
standby letter of credit guarantees, the Company have issues additional
guarantees as off-balance sheet arrangement. As of December 31, 2004,
those guarantees include the following:

·

The
Bank has guaranteed credit cards issued to our clients by an unaffiliated
financial institution. As of December 31, 2004, the combined credit limits
on those accounts are $44.5 million.

·

The Company may be required
to make contingent payments to the former owners of Woodside Asset Management
based on their future revenue growth. During 2004, the Company paid one
earn-out payment of $338,000 to the former owners of Woodside Asset Management.
As of December 31, 2004, under the acquisition agreement, the maximum
future gross earn-out payments to Woodside Asset Management’s former owners are
$1.6 million.

Foreign Exchange
Forward Contracts

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with
clients involved in international trade finance activities, either as the
purchaser or seller of foreign currency at a future date, depending upon the
clients’ need. We enter into an opposite way foreign exchange forward contract
with a correspondent bank to hedge these contracts, which completely mitigates
the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for each of the
foreign exchange forward contracts entered into with our clients. These
contracts are short term in nature, typically expiring within one year. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, the notional amounts of these contracts totaled $377.3 million
and $95.4 million, respectively. The maximum credit exposure for counter-party
nonperformance for foreign exchange forward contracts with both clients and
correspondent banks amounted to $37.7 million at December 31, 2004 and
$9.5 million at December 31, 2003. We have not experienced
nonperformance by a counter party and therefore have not incurred related
losses. Further, we anticipate performance by all counter-parties to such
foreign exchange forward contracts.


We make foreign currency
loans to clients based in the United Kingdom. We enter into foreign exchange
forward contracts with correspondent banks to hedge the foreign exchange
exposure related to these loans. These contracts are short term in nature,
typically expiring within one year. At December 31, 2004, the
notional amounts of these contracts totaled $25.8 million. The maximum credit
exposure for counter-party nonperformance for foreign exchange forward
contracts related to our foreign exchange loans amounted to $2.6 million at December 31,
2004. There were no foreign exchange forward contracts related to foreign
exchange loans in 2003. We have not experienced nonperformance by a counter
party and therefore have not incurred related losses. Further, we anticipate
performance by all counter-parties to such foreign exchange forward contracts.

Foreign Currency
Option Contracts

We enter into foreign
currency option contracts with clients involved in international trade finance
activities, either as the purchaser or seller of foreign currency options,
depending upon the clients’ need. We enter into an opposite way foreign
currency option contract with a correspondent bank, which completely mitigates
the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for each of the
currency option contracts entered into with our clients. These contracts
typically expire in less than one year. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
notional amounts of these contracts totaled $13.5 million and $21.1 million,
respectively. We have not experienced nonperformance by a counter party and
therefore have not incurred related losses. Further, we anticipate performance
by all counter-parties.

Commitments to
Invest in Venture Capital Funds

We make commitments to
venture capital fund investments, which in turn make investments in privately
held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally made up to a
ten-year period from the inception of the venture capital fund. The timing of
future cash requirements to fund such commitments is generally dependent upon
the venture capital investment cycle, the overall market conditions, and the
nature and type of industry in which the privately held companies operate. As
of December 31, 2004, we had remaining unfunded commitments of $15.9
million to wholly owned venture capital fund investments and $39.6 million and
$55.2 million to venture capital fund investments through the funds of funds,
SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP and SVB Strategic Investors Fund II, LP,
respectively. We have committed capital of $13.5 million to SVB Strategic
Investors Fund, LP, representing an ownership interest of 11.1%. As of December 31,
2004, the remaining unfunded commitment to the fund was $5.7 million. We also
have committed capital of $15.0 million to SVB Strategic Investors Fund II, LP,
representing an ownership interest of 14.4%. As of December 31, 2004, the
remaining unfunded commitment to the fund was $13.5 million. We made a capital
commitment of $6.0 million to our venture capital fund, Silicon Valley
BancVentures, LP in which we have an ownership interest of 10.7%. The remaining
unfunded commitment to the fund was $2.9 million as of December 31, 2004.
We made a capital commitment of $25.0 million to the venture debt fund,
Partners for Growth, LP in which we have an ownership interest of 53.2%. As of December 31,
2004, the remaining unfunded commitment to the fund was $20.3 million. In
addition, we have committed capital of $20.0 million to Gold Hill Venture
Lending 03, LP in which we have an ownership interest of 9.3%. The remaining
unfunded commitment to the fund was $15.4 million.

SVB Capital II
Trust Preferred Securities

In October, 2003, SVB Capital II issued trust
preferred securities that Silicon Valley Bancshares has fully and
unconditionally guaranteed, based on its combined obligations under a guarantee
agreement, a trust agreement, an expense agreement, and a junior subordinated
indenture and the debentures issued under the junior subordinated indenture.
SVB Capital II will redeem the trust preferred securities on


October 15, 2033, and
may redeem them earlier, subject to prior approval by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, if then required by the capital rules of the
Federal Reserve Board.

Silicon Valley Bancshares entered into the guarantee
agreement concurrently with the issuance of the trust preferred securities for
the benefit of the holders of the trust preferred securities. Wilmington Trust
Company acts as guarantee trustee under the guarantee agreement for the
purposes of compliance with the Trust Indenture Act, and the guarantee is
qualified as an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. The guarantee trustee
will hold the guarantee for the benefit of the holders of the trust preferred
securities.

We account for variable interest entities according to
the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIE)” or FIN No. 46R. A VIE
is to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to the majority
of the risk of loss from the VIE’s activities, is entitled to receive the
majority of the entity’s residual returns, or both. As we do not bear the
majority of the risk of loss from the trust preferred securities, they were not
consolidated into our financial statements at December 31, 2004, or December 31,
2003.

For a description of
certain off balance-sheet arrangements, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 20. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,
Guarantees, and Other Commitments.

Item 7a.

Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk
Management

A key objective of asset/liability management is to
manage interest rate risk associated with changing asset and liability cash
flows and market interest rate movements. Interest rate risk occurs when
interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities do not re-price simultaneously
either in timing, volume or both. Our ALCO provides oversight to our interest
rate risk management process and recommends policy guidelines regarding
exposure to interest rates for approval by our board of directors. Adherence to
these policies is monitored on an ongoing basis, and decisions related to the
management of interest rate exposure are made when appropriate.

We manage interest rate risk principally through
strategies involving our investment securities portfolio. Our policies permit
the use of off-balance sheet derivative instruments in managing interest rate
risk. Derivative instruments that the Company uses as a part of its interest
risk management strategy may include interest rate swaps, caps and floors, and
forward contracts.

We had a fair value hedge in effect at December 31,
2004. This hedge is a $50.0 million fixed-for-variable swap of our 7%
junior subordinated debentures, described in Item 8 Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12. Borrowings  and under Item 7. MD&A—Financial
Condition—7% Junior Subordinated Debentures. For 2004, we paid interest expense
of $3.5 million on the 7.0% junior subordinated debentures. However, the fair
value hedge agreement provided a benefit of $2.2 million, resulting in net
interest expense of $1.3 million for 2004.

Our monitoring activities
related to managing interest rate risk include both interest rate sensitivity
gap analysis and the use of a simulation model. While traditional gap analysis
provides a simple picture of the interest rate risk embedded in the balance
sheet, it provides only a static view of interest rate sensitivity at a
specific point in time and does not measure the potential volatility in
forecasted results relating to changes in market interest rates over time. Accordingly,
we combine the use of gap analysis with use of a simulation model that provides
a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity.

Interest Rate
Sensitivity Analysis

The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the
difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-sensitive
liabilities that are anticipated to re-price within a specific time period. A
gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets
exceeds the amount of interest-sensitive liabilities re-pricing within
that same time period. Positive cumulative gaps in early time periods suggest
that earnings will increase when interest rates rise. Negative cumulative gaps
suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates fall. The gap analysis
as of December 31, 2004 indicates that the cumulative one-year gap as a
percentage of interest-earning assets was a positive 31%.


The following table
illustrates our interest rate sensitivity gap positions at December 31,
2004:

(1)

Includes interest-bearing deposits in other financial
institutions of $15.9 million as of December 31, 2004.

(2)

Principal cash flows are based on
estimated principal payments as of December 31, 2004.

(3)

Not stated column consists of investments
in Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock as of December 31,
2004.

(4)

Not stated column consists of nonaccrual
loans of $14.3 million offset by unearned income of $14.4 million as
of December 31, 2004.

(5)

Maturity/repricing columns for fixed rate
loans are based upon the amount and timing of related principal payments as of December 31,
2004.


Market Value of
Portfolio Equity (MVPE)

One application of the aforementioned simulation model
involves measurement of the impact of market interest rate changes on the net
present value of estimated cash flows from our assets, liabilities, and
off-balance sheet items, defined as our market value of portfolio equity
(MVPE).

The
following table presents our MVPE exposure at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
related to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market
interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points, respectively.

The preceding table indicates that at December 31,
2004, in the event of an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in
market interest rates, our MVPE would be expected to increase or decrease
accordingly.

The market value calculations supporting the results
in the preceding table are based on the present value of estimated cash flows
using both market interest rates provided by independent broker/dealers and
other publicly available sources that we deem reliable. These calculations do
not contemplate any changes that we could make to reduce our MVPE exposure in
response to a change in market interest rates.

As with any method of measuring interest rate risk,
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the
preceding table. For example, although certain of our assets and liabilities
may have similar maturity or re-pricing profiles, they may react to changes in
market interest rates with different magnitudes. Also, actual prepayment rates
on loans and investments could vary substantially from the assumptions utilized
in the model to derive the results as presented in the preceding table. Further,
a change in the shape of the forward yield curve could result in different MVPE
estimations from those presented herein. Accordingly, the results in the
preceding table should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in
the event of changing market interest rates. Additionally, the resulting MVPE
estimates are not intended to represent, and should not be construed to
represent the underlying value.

Our MVPE exposure at December 31, 2004, increased
slightly from December 31, 2003, primarily due to changes in the
investment portfolio while staying well within our policy guidelines. In
addition, our net interest income at risk remains well within policy limits. These
estimates are highly assumption dependent and will change regularly as the
company’s asset-liability structure changes and as different interest rate
environments evolve. We expect to continue to manage our interest rate risk
actively utilizing on and off-balance sheet strategies as appropriate.


The simulation model also gives us the ability to
simulate our net interest income using an interest rate forecast (simple
simulation). In order to measure the sensitivity of our forecasted net interest
income to changing interest rates utilizing the simple simulation methodology,
both a rising and falling interest rate scenario are projected and compared to
a base market interest rate forecast derived from the current yield curve. For
the rising and falling interest rate scenarios, the base market interest rate
forecast is increased or decreased, as applicable, by 200 basis points in
12 equal increments over a one-year period.

In addition to the 200 basis point ramp scenario
mentioned above we perform net interest income and net income simulations in an
interest rate environment whereby we shock the base rate immediately both up
and down 300 basis points in 100 basis point increments. The combination
of the ramp and shock scenarios provides us with additional information with
respect to our sensitivity to interest rates and the impact on our net income
under varied interest rate scenarios.

Our policy guidelines provide that the difference
between a base market interest rate forecast scenario over the succeeding
one-year period compared with the aforementioned rising and falling interest
rate scenarios over the same time period should not result in net interest
income degradation exceeding 25.0%. Simulations as of December 31, 2004,
indicated that we were well within these policy guidelines.

Interest rate risk is the
most significant market risk impacting us. Other types of market risk affecting
us in the normal course of our business activities include foreign currency
exchange risk, equity price risk, and basis risk. The impact resulting from
these market risks is not considered significant, and no separate quantitative
information concerning market rate and price exposure is presented herein.


Factors
That May Affect Future Results

Our business faces significant risks. The factors
described below may not be the only risks we face, and are not intended to
serve as a comprehensive listing. Additional risks that we do not yet know of
or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business
operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following
factors actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or results of
operations could suffer.

If a
significant number of clients fail to perform under their loans, our business,
profitability, and financial condition would be adversely affected.

As a lender, the largest
risk we face is the possibility that a significant number of our client
borrowers will fail to pay their loans when due. If borrower defaults cause
losses in excess of our allowance for loan and lease losses, it could have an
adverse effect on our business, profitability, and financial condition. We have
established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the
allowance for loan and lease losses. While this evaluation process uses
historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the
establishment of loan losses are dependent to a great extent on our experience
and judgment. We cannot assure you that our allowance for loan and lease losses
will be sufficient to absorb future loan losses or prevent a material adverse
effect on our business, profitability, or financial condition.

Because of the credit profile of our loan portfolio,
our levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs can be volatile, and we may
need to make material provisions for loan losses in any period, which could
cause reduced net income or increased net losses in that period.

Our loan portfolio has a
credit profile different from that of most other banking companies. Many of our
loans are made to companies in the early stages of development with negative
cash flow and no established record of profitable operations. In many cases,
repayment of the loan is dependent upon receipt of additional equity financing
from venture capitalists or others. Collateral for many of the loans often
includes intellectual property, which is difficult to value and may not be
readily salable in the case of default. Because of the intense competition and
rapid technological change that characterizes the companies in our technology and
life science industry sectors, a borrower’s financial position can deteriorate
rapidly. We also make loans that are larger, relative to the revenues of the
borrower, than those made by traditional small business lenders, so the impact
of any single borrower default may be more significant to us. Because of these
characteristics, our level of nonperforming loans and loan charge-offs can be
volatile and can vary materially from period to period. Changes in our level of
nonperforming loans may require us to make material provisions for loan losses
in any period, which could reduce our net income or cause net losses in that
period.

Our
current level of interest rate spread may decline in the future. Any material
reduction in our interest spread could have a material impact on our business
and profitability.

A major portion of our net
income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the
interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and
other borrowings, and the interest rates we receive on interest-earning assets,
such as loans extended to our clients and securities held in our investment
portfolio. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our
control, such as inflation, recession, global economic disruptions, and
unemployment. In addition, legislative changes could affect the manner in which
we pay interest on deposits or other liabilities. For example, Congress has for
many years debated repealing a law that prohibits banks from paying interest
rates on checking accounts. If this law were to be repealed, we would be
subject to competitive pressure to pay interest on our clients’ checking
accounts, which would negatively affect our interest rate spread. Any material
decline in our interest rate spread would have a material adverse effect on our
business and profitability.


Decreases
in the amount of equity capital available to start-up and emerging-growth
companies could adversely affect our business, profitability, and growth
prospects.

Our strategy has focused on providing banking products
and services to emerging-growth and corporate technology companies receiving
financial support from sophisticated investors, including venture capitalists, “angels,”
and corporate investors. In some cases, our lending credit decision is based on
our analysis of the likelihood that our venture capital or angel-backed client
will receive a second or third round of equity infusion from investors. If the
amount of capital available to such companies decreases, it is likely that the
number of new clients and investor financial support to our existing borrowers
could decrease, which would have an adverse effect on our business,
profitability and growth prospects.

Among the factors that
have and could in the future affect the amount of capital available to startup
and emerging-growth companies are the receptivity of the capital markets to
initial public offerings or mergers and acquisitions of companies within our
technology and life science industry sectors, the availability and return on
alternative investments, and general economic conditions in the technology and
life science industries. Reduced capital markets valuations could reduce the
amount of capital available to startup and emerging-growth companies, including
companies within our technology and life science industry sectors.

Our
business is dependent upon access to funds on attractive terms.

We derive our net interest
income through lending or investing capital on terms that provide returns in
excess of our costs for obtaining that capital. As a result, our credit ratings
are extremely important to our business. A reduction in our credit ratings
could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our
borrowing costs (or trigger obligations under certain existing borrowings and
other contracts), or increase the interest rates we pay our depositors.
Further, our credit ratings and the terms upon which we have access to capital
may be influenced by circumstances beyond our control, such as overall trends
in the general market environment, perceptions about our creditworthiness or
market conditions in the industries in which we focus.

In
the event that we further change our method of accounting for stock
compensation expense, our cash flows and results of operations, as well as our
ability to attract, recruit, and retain certain key employees, could be
adversely affected.

We account for our
employee stock options in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
and related interpretations, which provide that any compensation expense
relative to employee stock options be measured based on the intrinsic value of
the stock options. As a result, when options are priced at the fair market
value of the underlying stock on the date of grant, as is our practice, we
incur no compensation expense. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” which is a revision of SFAS
No. 123 and supersedes APB No. 25.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to
record compensation expense for all employee stock grants. Such expense will
have a material impact on our results of operations. In October 2004, in
an effort to align our option grant rate to that of other financial
institutions similar to us, we significantly decreased the number of shares
subject to options granted to our employees on a prospective basis. We may in
the future consider taking other actions to modify employee compensation
structures, such as granting cash compensation or other forms of equity
compensation. Our decision to reduce the number of option shares to be granted
on a prospective basis, and any other future changes we may adopt in our
employee compensation structures, could adversely affect our results of
operations and cash flows, as well as our ability to attract, recruit, and
retain certain key employees.


We
are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities
and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our
business.

Silicon Valley Bancshares,
Silicon Valley Bank, and their subsidiaries are extensively regulated under
federal and state law. These regulations are intended primarily for the
protection of depositors, other clients, and the deposit insurance fund—not for
the benefit of stockholders or security holders. Federal and state laws and
regulations limit or otherwise affect the activities in which Silicon Valley
Bancshares, Silicon Valley Bank, and their subsidiaries may engage. A change in
the applicable statutes, regulations, or regulatory policy may have a material
effect on our business and that of our subsidiaries. In addition, Silicon
Valley Bancshares, Silicon Valley Bank, and their subsidiaries are required to
maintain certain minimum levels of capital. Federal and state banking regulators
possess broad powers to take supervisory action, as they deem appropriate, with
respect to Silicon Valley Bancshares and Silicon Valley Bank. SVB Alliant and
SVB Securities, both broker-dealer subsidiaries, are regulated by the SEC and
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD). Violations of
the stringent regulations governing the actions of a broker-dealer can result
in the revocation of broker-dealer licenses, the imposition of censures or
fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders, and the suspension or expulsion
from the securities business of a firm, its officers or employees. Supervisory
actions can result in higher capital requirements, higher insurance premiums,
and limitations on the activities of Silicon Valley Bancshares, Silicon Valley
Bank or their subsidiaries. These supervisory actions could have a material
adverse effect on our business and profitability.

Warrant,
venture capital fund, and direct equity investment portfolio gains or losses
depend upon the performance of the portfolio investments and the general
condition of the public equity markets, which is uncertain.

We have historically
obtained rights to acquire stock, in the form of warrants, in certain clients
as part of negotiated credit facilities and for other services. We may not be
able to realize gains from warrants in future periods, or our realized gains
may be materially less than the current level of unrealized gains disclosed in
this filing. We also have made investments in venture capital funds as well as
direct equity investments in companies. The timing and amount of income, if
any, from the disposition of client warrants, venture capital funds, and direct
equity investments typically depend upon factors beyond our control, including
the performance of the underlying portfolio companies, investor demand for
initial public offerings, fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying
common stock of these companies, levels of mergers and acquisitions activity,
and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying
securities. In addition, our investments in venture capital funds and direct
equity investments have lost value and could continue to lose value or become
worthless, which would reduce our net income or could cause a net loss in any
period. All of these factors are difficult to predict, particularly in the
current economic environment. Additionally, it is likely that additional
investments within our existing portfolio will become impaired. However, we are
not in a position to know at the present time which specific investments, if
any, are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual
impairments. Therefore, we cannot predict future investment gains or losses
with any degree of accuracy, and any gains or losses are likely to vary
materially from period to period.

Public
offerings and mergers and acquisitions involving our clients can cause loans to
be paid off early, which could adversely affect our business and profitability.

While an active market for
public equity offerings and mergers and acquisitions generally has positive
implications for our business, one negative consequence is that our clients may
pay off or reduce their loans with us if they complete a public equity offering
or are acquired or merge with another company. Any significant reduction in our
outstanding loans could have a material adverse effect on our business and
profitability.


Adverse
changes in domestic or global economic conditions, especially in the technology
sector and particularly in California, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, growth, and profitability.

If conditions worsen in
the domestic or global economy, especially in the technology, life science,
private equity, and premium wine industry niches, our business, growth, and
profitability are likely to be materially adversely affected. A worsening of
the global or U.S. economic slowdown would harm many of our clients. Our
clients may be particularly sensitive to disruptions in the growth of the
technology sector of the U.S. economy. In addition, a substantial number of our
clients are geographically concentrated in California, and adverse economic
conditions in California could harm the businesses of a disproportionate number
of our clients. To the extent that our clients’ underlying businesses are
harmed, they are more likely to default on their loans.

If we
fail to retain our key employees, our growth and profitability could be
adversely affected.

We rely on experienced
client relationship managers and on officers and employees with strong
relationships with the venture capital community to generate new business. If a
significant number of these employees were to leave us, our growth and
profitability could be adversely affected. We believe that our employees frequently
have opportunities for alternative employment with competing financial
institutions and with our clients.

We
cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our historical levels of
profitability in the face of sustained competitive pressures.

Other banks and specialty
and diversified financial services companies, many of which are larger and have
more capital than we do, offer lending, leasing, other financial products and
advisory services to our client base. In some cases, our competitors focus
their marketing on our industry sectors and seek to increase their lending and
other financial relationships with technology companies, early stage growth
companies or special industries such as wineries. In other cases, our
competitors may offer a broader range of financial products to our clients.
When new competitors seek to enter one of our markets, or when existing market
participants seek to increase their market share, they sometimes undercut the
pricing and/or credit terms prevalent in that market. Our pricing and credit
terms could deteriorate if we act to meet these competitive challenges.

We
face risks in connection with completed or potential acquisitions.

We completed one acquisition in each of 2002 and 2001
and, if appropriate opportunities present themselves, we intend to acquire
businesses, technologies, services or products that we believe are strategic.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, negotiate or
finance future acquisitions successfully or integrate such acquisitions with
our current business.

Future acquisitions could result in potentially
dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, and/or
contingent liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, and/or financial condition. Any such future
acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services, or products might
require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be
available on terms favorable to us, or at all; and such financing, if
available, might be dilutive.

Upon completion of an acquisition, we are faced with
the challenges of integrating the operations, services, products, personnel,
and systems of acquired companies into our business, which may divert
management’s attention from ongoing business operations. In addition,
acquisitions of new businesses may subject us to regulatory scrutiny. We cannot
assure you that we will be successful in integrating any acquired business
effectively into the operations of our business. Moreover, there can be no
assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will be realized.


The success of our
acquisitions is dependent on the continued employment of several key employees.
If acquired businesses do not meet projected revenue targets, or if certain key
employees were to leave the businesses, we could conclude that the value of the
businesses has decreased and that the related goodwill has been impaired. If we
were to conclude that goodwill has been impaired that conclusion would result
in an impairment of goodwill charge to us, which would adversely affect our
results of operations.

We
could be liable for breaches of security in our online banking services. Fear
of security breaches could limit the growth of our online services.

We offer various Internet-based services to our
clients, including online banking services. The secure transmission of
confidential information over the Internet is essential to maintain our clients’
confidence in our online services. Advances in computer capabilities, new
discoveries, or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of
the technology we use to protect client transaction data. Although we have
developed systems and processes that are designed to prevent security breaches and
periodically test our security, failure to mitigate breaches of security could
adversely affect our ability to offer and grow our online services and could
harm our business.

People generally are
concerned with security and privacy on the Internet and any publicized security
problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet as a means of conducting
commercial transactions. Our ability to provide financial services over the
Internet would be severely impeded if clients became unwilling to transmit confidential
information online. As a result, our operations and financial condition could
be adversely affected.

We
face risks associated with international operations.

A component of our
strategy is to expand internationally on a limited basis. Expansion into international
markets, albeit on a limited basis, requires management’s attention and
resources. We have limited experience in internationalizing our service, and we
believe that many of our competitors are also undertaking expansion into
foreign markets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in
expanding into international markets. In addition to the uncertainty regarding
our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations and to expand our
international presence, there are certain risks inherent in doing business on
an international basis, including, among others, regulatory requirements, legal
uncertainty regarding liability, tariffs, and other trade barriers,
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, longer payment cycles,
different accounting practices, problems in collecting loan or other types of
payments, political instability, seasonal reductions in business activity, and
potentially adverse tax consequences, any of which could adversely affect the
success of our international operations. To the extent we continue to
expand our international operations and have additional portions of our
international revenues denominated in foreign currencies, we could become
subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations. There can be no assurance that one or more of the factors
discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, and/or financial condition.

Maintaining
or increasing our market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory
approval of new products and services.

Our success depends, in
part, upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry
standards and client demands. There is increasing pressure on financial services
companies to provide products and services at lower prices. In addition, the
widespread adoption of new technologies, including Internet-based services,
could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our
existing products or services. A failure to achieve market acceptance of any
new products we introduce, or a failure to introduce products that the market
may demand, could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability, or
growth prospects.


Business
interruptions due to natural disasters and other events beyond our control can
adversely affect our business.

Our operations can be subject to natural disasters and
other events beyond our control, such as earthquakes, fires, power failures,
telecommunication loss, terrorist attacks, and acts of war. Our corporate
headquarters and a portion of our critical business offices are located in
California near major earthquake faults. Such events of disaster, whether
natural or manmade, could cause severe destruction or interruption to our
operations and as a result, our business could suffer serious harm. To mitigate
these risks we have begun a phased business continuity program, with initial
capabilities scheduled to become available during 2005 and additional work
continuing throughout 2006.


Report Of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Silicon Valley Bancshares:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that Silicon Valley Bancshares and subsidiaries (the Company)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also,
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and
the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2004, and our report dated March 14, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year

SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   Nature
of Business

Silicon Valley Bancshares
and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Company) offer clients
financial products and services through four lines of banking and financial
services (see Note 24 Segment Reporting). Silicon Valley Bancshares
(Bancshares) is a bank holding company and a financial holding company whose
principal subsidiary is Silicon Valley Bank (the Bank), a California-chartered
bank, founded in 1983, and headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The Bank
serves more than 10,000 clients across the country, through its 25 regional
offices in the United States, a subsidiary in England and one in India. The
Bank has 12 offices throughout California and operates regional offices across
the country, in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.
The Bank serves clients in all stages of maturity ranging from emerging-growth
companies to established corporate companies in the technology and life science
markets and the premium wine industry. The Company defines “emerging-growth”
clients as companies in the start-up or early stages of their lifecycle; these
companies tend to be privately held and backed by venture capital; they
generally have few employees, are primarily engaged in research and
development, have brought relatively few products or services to market, and
have no or little revenue. By contrast, the Company defines “established
corporate” clients as companies that tend to be more mature; these companies
may be publicly traded, and more established in the markets in which they
participate. Additionally, merger, acquisition, private placement, and
corporate partnering services are provided through the Company’s wholly-owned
investment banking subsidiary, SVB Alliant, whose offices are in California and
Massachusetts.

2.   Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. A material estimate that is particularly susceptible to possible
change in the near term relates to the determination of the allowance for loan
and lease losses. An estimate of possible changes or a range of possible
changes cannot be made.

Principles of Consolidation and Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Silicon Valley Bancshares and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation The Company
consolidates the financial position and results of operations of several
managed limited partnerships as the Company controls the general partners of
these limited partner funds and the limited partners do not hold substantive
participating rights. See Note 2. Non-marketable Equity Securities. Similar
accounting is applied to SVB Woodside Financial, the general partner of Taurus
Growth Partners, LP and Libra Partners, LP (see Note 3. Business Combinations).
Bancshares has an ownership interest of 53.2% in Partners for Growth, LP, and,
therefore, the fund is consolidated. Minority interest in capital of
consolidated affiliates primarily represents the minority participants’ share
of the equity in SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP, SVB Strategic Investors Fund
II LP, and Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP. Additionally, certain
reclassifications have been made to prior years’ consolidated financial
statements in order to conform to the current year’s presentation.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Historically, the Company
aggregated its allowance for loan and lease losses and its allowance for loan
loss contingency and reflected the aggregate allowance in its allowance for
loan and lease losses (ALLL) balance. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2004,
the Company reflected its allowance for loan and lease losses in its ALLL
balance and its allowance for loan loss contingency in other liabilities. These
reclassifications were also made to prior periods’ balance sheets to conform to
current period’s presentations. Additionally, the Company reclassified expense
related to the ALLL to provision for loan losses and expense related to changes
in the allowance for loan loss contingency into noninterest expense for all
periods presented. Such reclassifications had no effect on our results of
operations or stockholders’ equity.

Accounting for Variable Interest Entities

The Company accounts for variable interest entities according
to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) No. 46
(revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
(VIE)”, or FIN No. 46R. FIN No. 46R was issued to replace FIN No. 46,
and to clarify the required accounting for interests in variable interest
entities. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investments
at risk or for which the holders of the equity instruments lack the essential
characteristics of a controlling financial interest. A VIE must be consolidated
by a company if that company is considered to be the primary beneficiary,
either by being subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE’s
activities, being entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns,
or both.

Gold Hill Venture Lending
03, LP is a VIE, however the Company is not the primary beneficiary. As of December 31,
2004, the Company has evaluated its investments and has not consolidated any
VIE’s in its financial statements, in accordance with the provisions of FIN No. 46R.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents
consist of cash on hand, cash balances due from banks, federal funds sold, and
securities purchased under agreement to resell. For purposes of the
consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers cash equivalents
to be highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts
of cash and present insignificant risk of changes in value with maturity dates
of 90 days or less.

Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased under
Agreement to Resell

Federal funds sold and
securities purchased under agreement to resell as reported in the consolidated
balance sheet include interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions
of $15.9 million and $1.8 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Investment Securities

Fixed Income
Securities

Fixed income investment securities are classified as
held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, trading, or non-marketable upon purchase
or acquisition.

Securities purchased with the ability and positive
intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and
are accounted for at historical cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums
or the accretion of discounts to maturity, where appropriate. The Company did
not have any investments in the held-to-maturity portfolio at December 31,
2004 and 2003. Unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities

become realized and are
charged against earnings when it is determined that an other-than-temporary
decline in value has occurred.

Securities that are held
to meet investment objectives such as interest rate risk and liquidity
management, and which may be sold by the Company as needed to implement
management strategies are classified as available-for-sale and are accounted
for at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities, after applicable taxes, are reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income, which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity,
until realized.

Permanent impairment
results if (a) no fair market value can be obtained and no market is
believed to exist or (b) the current fair value of the security is
impaired as a result of an event whereby the contractual rights of a class of
holders are deemed to be impaired. Market valuations represent the current fair
value of a security at a specified point in time and do not represent the risk
of repayment of the principal if a security is held to maturity. Gains and
losses on securities are only realized upon the sale of the security prior to
maturity, whereas a credit downgrade represents an increased level of risk of
other-than-temporary impairment, and will only be recognized if the
Company assesses the downgrade to challenge the issuer’s ability to service the
debt and to repay the principal at contractual maturity.

Amortization of premiums
and accretion of discounts on debt securities are included in interest income
over the contractual terms of the underlying investment securities replicating
the effective interest method.

Securities acquired and
held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as
trading and are accounted for at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses
resulting from fair value adjustments on trading securities, as well as gains
and losses realized upon the sale of investment securities, are included in
noninterest income. The Company did not have a trading portfolio at December 31,
2004 or 2003.

Non-marketable securities
include Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and tax credit
funds.

Marketable Equity
Securities

The Company’s
investments in marketable equity securities include:

·

Unexercised
warrants for shares of publicly traded companies.

·

Investments
in shares of publicly traded companies. Equity securities in the Company’s
warrant, direct equity, and venture capital fund portfolios generally become
marketable when a portfolio company completes an initial public offering on a
publicly reported market or is acquired by a publicly traded company.

Unrealized gains on
warrants and unrealized gains or losses on equity investment securities are
recorded upon the establishment of a readily determinable fair value of the
underlying security, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Instruments.”

·

Unrealized
gains or losses after applicable taxes, on available-for-sale marketable equity
securities that result from initial public offerings are excluded from earnings
and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. The Company is often contractually
restricted from selling equity securities for a certain period of time
subsequent to the portfolio company’s initial public offering. Often, equity
securities held by the Company for sale are not registered under the Securities
Act of 1933 (the Securities Act). In such an event, the


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Company often seeks exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act by effecting sales of equity securities of the portfolio company
in compliance with the current public information, holding period, volume
limitation, and manner of sale requirements of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act. In addition, as an inducement to the underwriter(s) to
underwrite such an offering, security holders, including the Company, typically
enter into an agreement with the underwriter(s) and/or the portfolio
company, pursuant to which the security holder agrees to refrain from selling
the securities held by such holder for a period of time, often 180 days, after
the initial public offering. As a result of such regulatory and contractual
requirements, the Company is frequently restricted for some period of time in
its ability to liquidate portfolio securities even after a portfolio company
has completed an initial public offering. Gains or losses on these marketable
equity instruments are recorded in the Company’s consolidated net income in the
period the underlying securities are sold to a third party.

·

If
the Company possesses a warrant that can be settled with net cash payment to
the Company, the warrant meets the definition of a derivative instrument. Changes
in fair value of such derivative instruments are recognized as securities gains
or losses in the Company’s consolidated net income.

Marketable equity
securities are recorded at fair value, which initially is the purchase cost of
the securities. However, a decline in the fair value of any of these securities
that is considered other-than-temporary is recorded in the Company’s
consolidated net income in the period the impairment occurs. The cost basis of
the underlying security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis.

Marketable equity
securities held through the Company’s consolidated managed limited partnership
funds are recorded at fair value, which initially is the purchase cost of the
securities. Holdings that are saleable without restriction are valued at the
most recent stock exchange closing price prior to the valuation. In addition,
holdings that are subject to limitations under Rule 144 and/or Rule 145,
underwriter lock-ups, or in cases where Bancshares and its affiliates could be
considered an affiliate of the issuer, are discounted to allow for possible
price reduction due to restrictions on liquidity. Discounts will range
dependent upon many factors, including but not limited to co-investor
discount(s), trading volume, and price volatility.

Non-Marketable
Equity Securities

The Company invests
in non-marketable equity securities in several ways:

·

By
receipt of warrants for shares of privately held companies.

·

By
direct purchases of preferred or common stock in privately held companies.

·

By
capital contributions to venture capital funds, which in turn, make investments
in preferred or common stock of privately held companies.

·

Through
the Company’s venture capital fund, Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP, which
makes investments in preferred or common stock of privately held companies.

·

Through
the Company’s funds of funds, SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP and SVB
Strategic Investors Fund II, LP, which make investments in venture capital
funds, which in turn, invest in privately held companies.

·

Through
the Company’s investments in Partners for Growth, LP and Gold Hill Venture Lending
03, LP, which provide financing to privately-held companies in the form of
loans and equity.

Unexercised warrant securities in private companies
are initially recorded at a nominal value on the Company’s consolidated balance
sheets. They are carried at this value until they become marketable or expire,
except in the following circumstance:


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Gains on warrant and gains or losses on equity
investment securities that result from a portfolio company being acquired by a
publicly traded company are marked to market when the acquisition occurs. The
resulting gains or losses are recognized into consolidated net income on that
date, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, Issue No. 91-5, “Nonmonetary
Exchange of Cost-Method Investments.” Further fluctuations in the market
value of these marketable equity securities are excluded from consolidated net
income and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a
separate component of stockholders’ equity. Upon the sale of these equity
securities to a third party, gains and losses, which are measured from the
acquisition price, are recognized in the Company’s consolidated net income.

The Company accounts for non-marketable equity
investment securities (including warrants), other than those held by the SVB
Strategic Investors Fund, LP SVB Strategic Investors Fund II, LP, Silicon
Valley BancVentures, LP, Partners for Growth, LP and Gold Hill Venture Lending
03, LP, on a cost basis. In the event of a stock-based acquisition of a
non-publicly traded issuer by a publicly traded company, the Company will
realize gains or losses on these securities in the Company’s consolidated net
income when the transaction occurs.

A
summary of the Company’s accounting policies for other non-marketable equity
securities is presented in the following table. A complete description of the
accounting policies follows the table.

Investment company
  accounting, adjusted to fair

value on a quarterly basis through consolidated net income

Bancshares’ wholly owned non-marketable venture
capital fund investments and other direct equity investments are recorded on a
cost basis as the Company’s interests are considered minor because the Company
owns less than 5.0 % of the investee companies and has no influence over the
investee companies’ operating and financial policies. The Company’s cost basis
in each investment is reduced by returns until the cost basis of the individual
investment is fully recovered. Returns in excess of the cost basis are recorded
as investment gains in noninterest income.

The values of the investments are reviewed at least
quarterly, giving consideration to the facts and circumstances of each
individual investment. Management’s review of private equity investments
typically includes the relevant market conditions, offering prices, operating
results, financial conditions, and exit strategies. A decline in the fair value
that is considered other than temporary is recorded in the Company’s
consolidated net income in the period the impairment occurs. Any estimated loss
is recorded in noninterest income as investment losses.

Investments held by Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP
are recorded at fair value using investment accounting rules. The investments
consist principally of stock in private companies that are not traded on a
public market and are subject to restrictions on resale. These investments are
carried at estimated fair value as determined by the general partner. The
valuation generally remains at cost until such time that there is significant
evidence of a change in values based upon consideration of the relevant market

conditions, offering
prices, operating results, financial conditions, exit strategies, and other
pertinent information. The general partner, Silicon Valley BancVentures, Inc.
is owned and controlled by Bancshares and has an ownership interest of 10.7% in
Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP  The
limited partners do not have substantive participating rights. Therefore,
Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP is consolidated and any gains or losses
resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the investments are
recorded as investment gains or losses in the Company’s consolidated net income.
The portion of any gains or losses belonging to the other limited partners is
reflected in minority interest in net gains (losses) of consolidated affiliates
and adjusts Bancshares’ consolidated net income to reflect its percentage
ownership.

The SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP and SVB Strategic
Investors Fund II, LP (SIF I and II) portfolios consists primarily of
investments in venture capital funds, which are recorded at fair value using
investment company accounting rules. The carrying value of the investments is
determined by the general partners based on the percentage of SIF I and II’s
interest in the total fair market value as provided by each venture capital
fund Investment. SVB Strategic Investors, LLC and SVB Strategic Investors II,
LLC generally utilize the fair values assigned to the underlying respective
portfolio investments by the management of the venture capital funds. The
estimated fair value of the investments is determined after giving
consideration to the relevant market conditions, offering prices, operating
results, financial conditions, exit strategy, and other pertinent information. The
general partner of SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP, SVB Strategic Investors,
LLC, is owned and controlled by Bancshares and has an ownership interest of
11.1%. The general partner of SVB Strategic Investors Fund II, LP, SVB
Strategic Investors II, LLC, is owned and controlled by Bancshares and has an
ownership interest of 14.4%. The limited partners of these funds do not have
substantive participating rights. Therefore, SIF I and II are consolidated and
any gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the
venture capital fund investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in
the Company’s consolidated net income. The other limited partners share of any
gains or losses is reflected in minority interest in net gains (losses) of
consolidated affiliates and adjusts Bancshares’ consolidated net income to
reflect its percentage ownership.

Investments held by
Partners for Growth, LP and Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP are recorded at
fair value using investment accounting rules. The investments consist
principally of loans and stock in private companies that are not traded on a
public market and are subject to restrictions on resale. These investments are
carried at estimated fair value as determined by the general partner. The
general partner of Partners for Growth, LP, Partners for Growth GP, LLC, is not
owned or controlled by Bancshares. Bancshares has an ownership interest of
53.2% in Partners for Growth, LP and therefore, the fund is consolidated and
any gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the
investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in the Company’s
consolidated net income. The portion of any gains or losses belonging to the
other limited partners is reflected in minority interest in net gains (losses)
of consolidated affiliates and adjusts Bancshares’ consolidated net income to
its percentage ownership. Bancshares has a 90.7% ownership interest in the
general partner of Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP, Gold Hill Venture Lending
Partners 03, LLC. Bancshares and Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners 03, LLC
have an ownership interest of 5.0% and 4.8%, respectively, in Gold Hill Venture
Lending 03, LP. The limited partners of the fund have substantive participating
rights, in that they have the ability to remove the general partner without
cause. Therefore, Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP is not consolidated and
Bancshares carries the investments in the fund at estimated fair value as
determined by the general partner. Changes in the estimated fair value of the
investment are recorded as investment gains or losses in the Company’s
consolidated net income.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Loans

Loans are reported at the
principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income. Unearned income reflects
the net of both deferred loan origination and commitment fees and deferred loan
origination costs. The net amount of unearned income is amortized into loan
interest income over the contractual terms of the underlying loans and
commitments using the interest method, adjusted for actual loan prepayment
experience.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

The allowance for loan and lease losses is established
through a provision for loan losses charged to expense to provide for credit
risk. The Company’s allowance for loan and lease losses is established for loan
losses that are probable but not yet realized. The process of anticipating loan
losses is imprecise. The Company applies the following evaluation process to
its loan portfolio to estimate the required allowance for loan and lease
losses:

The Company maintains a systematic process for the
evaluation of individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan
losses. On a quarterly basis, each loan in its portfolio is assigned a credit
risk rating. Credit risk-ratings are assigned on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1
representing loans with a low risk of nonpayment, 9 representing loans with the
highest risk of nonpayment, and 10 representing loans, which have been charged
off. This credit risk-rating evaluation process includes, but is not limited
to, consideration of such factors as payment status, the financial condition of
the borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral
values, potential loan concentrations, and general economic conditions. The
Company’s policies require a committee of senior management to review, at least
quarterly, credit relationships that exceed specific dollar values. The Company’s
review process evaluates the appropriateness of the credit risk rating and
allocation of allowance for loan and lease losses, as well as other account
management functions. In addition, the Company’s management receives and approves
an analysis for all impaired loans, as defined by the SFAS No. 114, “Accounting
by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.” The allowance for loan and lease losses
is allocated based on a formula allocation for similarly risk-rated loans, or
for specific risk issues, which suggest a probable loss factor exceeding the
formula allocation for a specific loan or for individual impaired loans as
determined by SFAS No. 114.

The Company’s evaluation
process is designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan and
lease losses. The Company assesses the risk of losses inherent in the loan
portfolio by utilizing modeling techniques. For this purpose the Company has
developed a statistical model based on historical loan loss migration to
estimate an appropriate allowance for outstanding loan balances. In addition,
the Company applies a macro allocation to the results of the aforementioned
model to ascertain the total allowance for loan and lease losses. While this
evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, the
classification of loans and the establishment of the allowance for loan and
lease losses relies, to a great extent, on the judgment and experience of the
Company’s management.

Allowance for Loan Loss Contingency

The Company reserves for
the possibility of an unfunded loan commitment being funded and subsequently
being charged off. Each quarter, every client’s unfunded credit obligation is
allocated to a credit risk-rating category in accordance with the client’s
credit risk rating. The Company uses the historical loan loss factors described
above to calculate the possible loan loss experience if unfunded credit
commitments are funded by the Company. Separately the Company uses historical
trends to calculate a probability of an unfunded credit commitment being funded
by the Company. The Company applies the


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

loan
funding probability factor to risk factor—adjusted unfunded commitments by
credit risk rating to derive the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The
loan loss contingency reserve may also include certain macro allocations as
deemed appropriate by the Company’s management.

Nonaccrual Loans

SFAS No. 114, “Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan” and SFAS No. 118, “Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan Income Recognition and Disclosures” require the Company to
measure impairment of a loan based upon the present value of expected future
cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, except that as a
practical expedient, the Company may measure impairment based on the loan’s
observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is
collateral dependent. A loan is considered impaired when, based upon currently
known information, it is deemed probable that the Company will be unable to
collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement.

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become
90 days past due as to principal or interest payments (unless the principal and
interest are well secured and in the process of collection); when the Company
has determined, based upon currently known information, that the timely
collection of principal or interest is doubtful; or when the loans otherwise
become impaired under the provisions of SFAS No. 114.

When a loan is placed on
nonaccrual status, the accrued interest is reversed against interest income and
the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method thereafter until
qualifying for return to accrual status. Generally, a loan will be returned to
accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest become current in
accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and full collection of the
principal and interest appears probable.

Premises and Equipment

Premises
and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms
of the related leases, whichever is shorter. The maximum estimated useful lives
by asset classification are as follows:

Leasehold
  improvements

10 years

Furniture and
  equipment

3 years

Computer software

3 years

Computer hardware

3 years

Vehicles

3 years

The Company capitalizes the costs of computer software
developed or obtained for internal use in accordance to Statement of Position No. 98-1,
“Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use.

”

Capitalized computer
software costs consist of developed software, purchased software licenses and
implementation costs. Costs capitalized at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
amounted to $4.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Depreciation expense
was $3.9 million, $3.2 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

For property and equipment
that is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is
included in noninterest

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

expense
in consolidated net income. The Company had no capitalized lease obligations at
December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Business Combinations

The Company accounts for
business combinations in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations,” which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used
for all business combinations. SFAS No. 141 also specifies the criteria
that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must
meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill.

Goodwill

Goodwill, which arises from the purchase price
exceeding the assigned value of the net assets of an acquired business,
represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being
acquired. The value of goodwill is supported by the free cash flows from the
acquired businesses. A decline in earnings as a result of a decline in mergers
and acquisitions transaction volume or a decline in the valuations of mergers
and acquisitions clients could lead to impairment, which would be recorded as a
write-down in the Company’s consolidated net income.

On an annual basis or as circumstances dictate, the
Company’s management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other
developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount. The Company
conducts its reviews of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142,
which is based primarily on forecasted discounted cash flow analyses. The
evaluation methodology for potential impairments is inherently complex and
involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and
assumptions. The Company evaluates impairment using a two-step process. First,
the Company compares the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its
carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying
amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit
exceeds the fair value, then the Company compares the “implied” fair value,
defined below, of the reporting unit’s goodwill with its carrying amount. If
the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then
goodwill impairment is recognized by writing goodwill down to the implied fair
value.

The Company primarily uses a discounted future cash
flows approach to value the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill
impairment. These estimates involve many assumptions, including expected
results of operations, assumed discounts rates, and assumed growth rates for
the reporting units. The discount rate used is based on standard industry
practice, taking into account the expected equity risk premium, the size of the
business, and the probability of the reporting unit achieving its financial
forecasts. The implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of
the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the
unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit
was the purchase price.

Events that may indicate
goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in results of
operations of the business, economic or political climate, an adverse action or
assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, and a more
likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of.

Income from Warrants

Unexercised warrant equity instruments in private
companies are initially recorded at a nominal value on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets. They are carried at this value until they become
marketable or expire.

Gains on warrant equity instruments that result from a
portfolio company’s acquisition by a publicly traded company are marked to
market when the acquisition occurs. The resulting gains are recognized into consolidated
net income on that date, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF),
Issue No. 91-5, “Nonmonetary Exchange of Cost-Method Investments.”

Unrealized gains on warrant equity instruments are
recorded upon the establishment of a readily determinable fair value of the
underlying security, as defined by SFAS No.115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Instruments,” and are excluded from consolidated
net income and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a
separate component of stockholders’ equity.

Further fluctuations in
the market value of these marketable equity instruments, prior to eventual
sale, are also excluded from consolidated net income and are reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of
stockholders’ equity. Gains or losses on warrant equity instruments are
recorded in the Company’s consolidated net income in the period the underlying
securities are sold to a third party.

Reimbursement of Out of Pocket Expenses

The Company receives
reimbursement of out of pocket expenses related to lending and other products
offered. The reimbursements of these expenses are included in noninterest
income.

Income Taxes

The Company files a
consolidated federal income tax return, and consolidated, combined, or separate
state income tax returns as appropriate. The Company’s federal and state income
tax provisions are based upon taxes payable for the current year as well as
current year changes in deferred taxes related to temporary differences between
the tax basis and financial statement balances of assets and liabilities. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated financial
statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized. As changes
in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
adjusted through the provision for income taxes.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has elected to follow Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(APB No. 25), and related interpretations, to account for its employee
stock options rather than the alternative fair value accounting allowed by SFAS
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure.” APB No. 25
provides that the compensation expense relative to the Company’s employee stock
options be measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock option. SFAS No. 123
as amended by SFAS No. 148 requires those companies that continue to
follow APB No. 25 to provide pro forma disclosure of the impact of
applying the fair value method of SFAS No. 123.

The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation.”

The Company accounts for the cost of restricted stock
and restricted stock units by amortizing the grant date fair value of such
grants over their vesting period.

If
compensation cost related to both the Company’s stock option awards to
employees and directors and to the ESPP had been determined under the fair
value method prescribed under SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net income,
basic earnings per share, and diluted earnings per share would have been the
pro forma amounts shown below for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002:

Employee Benefit Plans

For restricted stock, unearned compensation equivalent
to the market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant is
charged to stockholder’s equity and amortized into noninterest expense over the
vesting term.

Compensation expense
related to the ESPP, used in determining the pro forma net income and basic and
diluted earnings per share amounts, was equal to the difference between the
fair value of the Company’s common stock when issued under the ESPP and the
actual price paid by employees to acquire the common stock.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Earnings Per Share

The Company calculates
earnings (loss) per common share in accordance to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 128, “Earnings Per Share” (SFAS 128). SFAS 128
requires the presentation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per
share for companies with potential common shares, such as warrants and options.
Accordingly, basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed using the
weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings (loss) per common share is computed using the weighted average number
of common stock shares and potential common shares outstanding during the
period. Potential common shares consist of contingently convertible debt (using
the “treasury stock” method), and stock options. Common stock equivalent shares
are excluded from the computation if the effect is antidilutive.

Segment Reporting

The Company is organized
into four lines of banking and financial services for management reporting: Commercial
Banking, SVB Capital, SVB Alliant, and Private Client Services and Other. These
operating segments are strategic units that offer different services to
different clients. They are managed separately because each segment appeals to
different markets and, accordingly, requires different strategies. The results
of operating segments are based on the Company’s internal profitability
reporting process (see Note 24 Segment Reporting).

Foreign Exchange Contracts

The Company enters into
foreign exchange contracts with clients involved in international trade finance
activities. The Company also enters into an opposite-way foreign exchange
contract with a correspondent bank, which completely mitigates the risk of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for each of the contracts
entered into with its clients. However, settlement, credit, and operational
risks remain. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are
recorded at fair value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Changes in
the fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately in noninterest
income.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for
derivative instruments in accordance with the provisions of

SFAS No. 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS
No. 149 amended and provided clarification on the accounting for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts, and for hedging activities under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149 was to be applied prospectively and was
effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. This
statement was applicable to existing contracts and new contracts entered into
after June 30, 2003, if those contracts relate to forward purchases or
sales of when-issued securities or other securities that do not yet exist. The
adoption of SFAS No. 149 has had no material impact on the Company’s
results of operations or financial condition.

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by SFAS No. 138, “Accounting
for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,” establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, and requires
that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
Additionally, the accounting for changes in fair value depends on whether the
derivative instrument is designated and qualifies as part of a hedging
relationship


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

and, if so, the nature of
the hedging activity. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not
qualify for hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective portion of a particular
hedge, must be recognized currently in earnings. For derivative instruments
that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current
period, unless the derivative instrument meets the qualification for the
short-cut treatment, as defined by SFAS No. 133 (see Note 15 Derivative
Financial Instruments). For derivative instruments that are designated and
qualify as a cash flow hedge, or for foreign exchange forward contracts that
are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of
the effective portion of the derivative instrument are recognized in other
comprehensive income (OCI). These amounts are reclassified from OCI and
recognized in earnings when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it
becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur.

The Company does not enter
into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

The Company accounts for
financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity
according to the provisions of SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.”  SFAS No. 150, issued by the FASB in May 2003,
established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within the
Statement’s scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Many of
those instruments were previously classified as equity or between the
liabilities and equity sections of the statement of financial position. SFAS No. 150
requires financial instruments issued in the form of shares that are
mandatorily redeemable (or embody an unconditional obligation requiring the
issuer to redeem them by transferring their assets at a specified or determinable
date or upon an event that is certain to occur) to be classified as liabilities.
The statement was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified
after May 31, 2003, and was effective at the beginning of the first
interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. It was implemented by
reporting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for
financial instruments created before the issuance date of the Statement and
still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption. Restatement
was not permitted.

The Company’s $40.0 million of “Company Mandatorily
Redeemable trust preferred securities of Subsidiary Trust Holding Solely junior
subordinated debentures,” or 8.25% trust preferred securities, were redeemed on
December 1, 2003. Beginning July 1, 2003, under SFAS No. 150,
the 8.25% trust preferred securities were classified under the liabilities
section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet and 8.25% trust preferred securities
distribution expense was classified under interest expense on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 150, these securities
were classified between the liability and equity sections of the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets, and their related expense was classified as noninterest
expense on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income, under the heading
Trust preferred securities distributions.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” which is a
revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB No. 25.  SFAS No. 123(R) requires the Company
to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
equity instruments using a fair value method, and record such expense in its
consolidated financial statements for interim or annual reporting periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will
require additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional
disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share-based payment
arrangements. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position,
and statement of cash flows as such expense will now be reported in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements rather than on a pro forma basis. However,
the Company expects that the pro forma expense calculated under SFAS No. 123
(above) does approximate the expense that will be recognized under SFAS No. 123(R).

3.   Business
Combinations

On October 1, 2002, the Company acquired
substantially all of the assets of Woodside Asset Management, Inc., an
investment advisor firm, which had approximately $200 million of client
financial assets under management for 70 clients. The Company expected Woodside
Asset Management, Inc. to enable it to expand its product offerings in the
private banking. Additionally, as part of this acquisition, Silicon Valley
Bancshares obtained the general partner interests in two limited partnerships,
Taurus Growth Partners, LP, and Libra Partners, LP. The Company has less than a
1% ownership interest in each of these funds. The remaining ownership interest
represents limited partners’ funds invested on their behalf by the general
partner in certain fixed income and marketable equity securities. However, due
to the Company’s ability to control the investing activities of these limited
partnerships, the Company has consolidated the related results of operations
and financial condition into its consolidated financial statements since the
date of acquisition. The limited partners did not hold substantive
participating rights. The financial assets of the Taurus and Libra funds were
liquidated and distributed to their respective limited partners prior to December 31,
2004.

The

securities portfolio into less than 12 months or 12 months or longer as of December 31,
2004:

(1)   As of December 31,
2004, the Company identified ten investments totaling $101.0 million that had
unrealized losses of $(2.5) million for a period of greater than twelve months.
Of the ten investments, $69.5 million related to six securities classified as
mortgaged-backed securities. These securities were originally purchased as
early as June 2003 and had unrealized losses of approximately $(1.6)
million in 2004. Since the unrealized losses were due solely to market interest
rate movements, the securities were deemed to be temporarily impaired. There
were investments of $21.6 million, which related to two securities classified
as collateralized mortgage obligation. They were originally purchased as early
as June 2002, and had unrealized losses of approximately $(0.7) million in
2004, also due solely to market interest rate movements, so they too were
deemed to be temporarily impaired. The two remaining securities totaled $9.9
million and had unrealized losses of $(0.2) million in 2004. These are auction
rate preferred securities and are classified as commercial paper and other debt
securities. The unrealized losses were the result of a credit downgrade from A1
to Baa2, effective June 25, 2002. The securities continue to be investment
grade and the Company has deemed the impairment as temporary. Market valuations
and impairment analysis on assets in the investment portfolio are reviewed and
monitored on an ongoing basis.

The following table provides the remaining contractual
principal maturities and fully taxable-equivalent yields on investment
securities as of December 31, 2004, except for auction rate securities
that use the next reset date as the maturity date. The weighted-average yield
is computed using the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities, which
are reported at fair value. Expected remaining maturities of callable U.S.
agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage
obligations may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because
borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without penalties. This
is most apparent in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations as contractual maturities are typically 15 to 30 years whereas,
expected average lives of these securities are significantly shorter and vary
based upon structure. Warrant securities, venture capital fund investments,
other private equity investments, Federal Reserve Bank stock, Federal Home Loan
Bank stock, and tax credit funds are included in the table below as maturing
after 10 years.

8.   Loans
and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

The
detailed composition of loans, net of unearned income of $14.4 million and
$12.3 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, is presented in
the following table:

The Company’s loan classifications for financial
reporting purposes differ from those for regulatory reporting purposes. Loans
are classified for financial reporting purposes based upon the purpose and
primary source of repayment of the loans. Loans are classified for regulatory
reporting purposes based upon the type of collateral securing the loans.

A substantial percentage of the Company’s loans are
commercial in nature, and such loans are generally made to emerging-growth or
corporate technology companies in a variety of industries. As of December 31,
2004, the Company’s software tools and applications industry subsector
represented 16.1% of total gross loans, the premium wine industry sector
represented 14.2% of total gross loans, the venture capital industry subsector
represented 13.2% of total gross loans, and the private client services sector
represented 11.2% of total gross loans. No other industry sector represented
more than 10.0% of total gross loans at December 31, 2004.

The
activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002, is summarized below:

The aggregate recorded
investment in loans for which impairment has been determined in accordance with
SFAS No. 114 totaled $14.3 million and $12.4 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, nonaccrual loans represented all impaired loans.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Allocations
of the allowance for loan and lease losses related to impaired loans totaled
$4.2 million and $3.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Average impaired loans for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, totaled $15.0 million, $15.6 million, and $19.6 million, respectively. If
these loans had not been impaired, $1.1 million, $1.0 million, and $1.3 million
in interest income would have been realized during the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company realized no interest income on
such impaired loans for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

9.   Premises and Equipment

Premises
and equipment at December 31, 2004 and 2003, consist of the following:

10.   Goodwill

Goodwill totaled $35.6
million and $37.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. All
of the Company’s goodwill at December 31, 2004, pertained to the
acquisition of SVB Alliant (Alliant Partners).

SVB Alliant

During the second quarter of 2004, the Company conducted
its annual impairment review of SVB Alliant (formerly Alliant Partners) in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, based primarily on
forecasted discounted cash flow analyses. The Company also conducted an
impairment review during the fourth quarter in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No. 142. In both instances, the valuation analysis of SVB Alliant
indicated no further impairment beyond that already identified and recorded.

During the second quarter of 2003, the Company
conducted its annual impairment review of SVB Alliant, which elicited an
indication of possible impairment. Despite an increase in revenues during the
second quarter of 2003 compared to the first quarter of 2003, SVB Alliant
failed to achieve the revenues projected by the financial model used to value
SVB Alliant in connection with its original acquisition by the Company. In
response to these indications, the Company engaged an internationally reputable
business consulting firm to assist the Company in a valuation of SVB Alliant,
in compliance with the requirements of SFAS No. 142. Based on this
valuation, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $17.0 million during
the second quarter of 2003.

During the fourth quarter
of 2003, it became apparent that the operating results of SVB Alliant during
the second half of 2003 were substantially below the performance forecasted in
connection with the second quarter analysis, primarily due to decreased fees
associated with weak initial public offering (IPO) and mergers and acquisitions
environments. The Company engaged the same business-consulting firm that

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

assisted
it with its annual impairment review during the second quarter of 2003 to
assist it in conducting a valuation of SVB Alliant, in compliance with the
requirements of SFAS No. 142. Based on this valuation, the Company
recorded an impairment charge of $46.0 million during the fourth quarter of
2003. The total impairment charge for 2003 was $63.0 million.

Woodside Asset
Management, Inc.

During the third quarter
of 2004, the Company conducted its annual impairment review of Woodside Asset
Management, Inc., which indicated possible impairment. Based primarily on
an internal analysis of forecasted discounted cash flows, the Company recorded
an impairment charge for the entire goodwill amount of $1.9 million during the
third quarter of 2004. Woodside Asset Management, Inc. failed to achieve
or exceed the projected operating results used as the basis of its valuation in
connection with its original acquisition by the Company.

11.   Deposits

The aggregate amount of
time deposit accounts individually exceeding $100,000 totaled $286.7 million
and $333.6 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest
expense paid on time deposits individually exceeding $100,000 totaled $1.7
million, $3.2 million, and $6.7 million for years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2004, time deposit accounts,
individually exceeding $100,000 totaling $281.8 million were scheduled to
mature within one year.

12.   Borrowings

The
following table represents outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002:

(1)

Relates to the acquisition of SVB Alliant (Alliant
Partners) in 2001 and were payable to the former owners, who have been employed
by the Company. These notes were discounted over their respective terms, based
on market interest rates as of September 28, 2001.

Interest expense related to borrowings was $3.0
million, $4.4 million, and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Weighted average interest rate associated
to the Company’s short-term borrowings outstanding for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002 was 1.4%, 3.1%, and 2.9%, respectively. See Note 3 Business
Combinations and Note 19 Related Parties.

On May 20, 2003, the Company issued $150.0
million of zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes at face value, due June 15,
2008, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Securities Act and outside
the United States to non-US persons pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act. The notes are convertible into the Company’s common stock at a
conversion price of $33.6277 per share and are subordinated to all present and
future senior debt of the Company. Holders of the notes may convert their notes
only if: (i) the price of the Company’s common stock issuable upon
conversion of a note reaches a specified threshold, (ii) specified
corporate transactions occur, or (iii) the trading price for the notes
falls below certain thresholds. At the initial conversion price, each $1,000
principal amount of notes will be convertible into approximately 29.7374 shares
of the Company’s common stock. This represents 4,460,410 shares of the Company’s
common stock. On August 14, 2003, the Company filed a shelf registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, with respect to the
resale of the notes and the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the
notes. The fair value of the convertible subordinated notes at December 31,
2004, was $205.9 million, based on quoted market prices. The Company intends to
settle the principal amount of $150.0 million (accreted value) in cash. The
notes were convertible during the year ended December 31, 2004, due to the
share price of $37.17 on September 30, 2004, exceeding their conversion
price. The Company is unaware of any note holders exercising their conversion
option. The potential dilutive effect of this contingently convertible debt
using the treasury stock method was 425,096 shares as of December 31,
2004, and was included in the calculation of earnings per share for the year
ended December 31, 2004, in accordance with the decreased EPS by $0.17 per
diluted common share, or 10 percent for 2004.

Concurrent with the
issuance of the convertible notes, the Company entered into a convertible note
hedge at a cost of $39.3 million and a warrant transaction providing proceeds
of $17.4 million with respect to its common stock, with the objective of
decreasing its exposure to potential dilution from conversion of the notes. The
terms and conditions of the convertible note hedge are disclosed in Note 15. Derivative
Financial Instruments. The cost of the convertible note hedge and the proceeds
of the warrant transaction were included in stockholders’ equity in accordance
with the guidance in EITF No. 00-19, Accounting for Derivative
Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
Stock. Under the warrant agreement, the Counterparty may purchase up to
approximately 4,460,410 shares of the Company’s common stock at $51.34 per
share, upon the occurrence of conversion events defined above. The warrant
transaction will expire on June 15, 2008.

7.0% Junior Subordinated Debentures

On October 30, 2003,
the Company issued $51.5 million in 7.0% junior subordinated debentures to a
special-purpose trust, SVB Capital II. Distributions to SVB Capital II are
cumulative and are payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 7.0% per annum of the
face value of the junior subordinated debentures. The junior subordinated
debentures are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the debentures on October 15,
2033, or to the extent that the Company redeems any debentures earlier. The
Company may redeem the debentures prior to maturity in whole or in part, at its
option, at any time on or after October 30, 2008. In addition, the Company
may redeem the debentures, in whole but not in part, prior to October 30,
2008, upon the occurrence of certain events. Issuance costs of $2.2 million
related to the junior subordinated debentures were deferred and are being
amortized over the period until mandatory redemption of the debentures in October 2033
(see Note 15. Derivative Financial Instruments). The fair value of the 7.0%
junior subordinated debentures is included in Note 21. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments. The Company has guaranteed the trust preferred securities issued
by SVB Capital II (see Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies).

8.25% Fixed Rate
Trust Preferred Securities

In May 1998, the Company issued $40.0 million in
cumulative trust preferred securities through a newly formed special-purpose
trust, SVB Capital I. At the time of redemption, the remaining unamortized
issuance costs of $1.3 million related to the trust preferred securities were
expensed

.

The Company completed the
early redemption of the 8.25% trust preferred securities December 1, 2003.
The trust was a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company, and its
sole assets were the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures.
Distributions were cumulative and were payable quarterly at a rate of 8.25% per
annum of the stated liquidation amount of $25 per preferred security. The
obligations of the trust were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a
subordinated basis, by the Company.

On June 3, 2002, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap, which

hedged against the risk of
changes in fair values associated with the Company’s $40.0 million, 8.25% fixed
rate, trust preferred securities. This agreement provided

income of $1.0 million and $1.1 million in 2003
and 2002, respectively. The swap was terminated on June 23, 2003. For
further information, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and

Operating Leases

The
Company is obligated under a number of noncancelable operating leases for
premises and equipment that expire at various dates, through 2014, and in most
instances, include options to renew or extend at market rates and terms. Such
leases may provide for periodic adjustments of rentals during the term of the
lease based on changes in various economic indicators. The following table
presents minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31,
2004:

Rent expense for premises
leased under operating leases totaled $11.1 million, $11.0 million, and $13.7
million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. In 2002, the Company


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

exited
leased premises, located in Santa Clara, California, approximating 18,000
square feet. The lease on the building will expire in August 2005. Management
determined that the premises would have no future economic value to the Company’s
operations, except for any potential future sub-lease arrangement. Therefore,
during 2002, the Company incurred charge-offs of approximately $2.5 million
related to the exit of these premises.

SVB Capital II Trust preferred securities

In October, 2003, SVB Capital II issued $50.0 million
in 7.0% trust preferred securities that Silicon Valley Bancshares has fully and
unconditionally guaranteed, based on its combined obligations under a guarantee
agreement, a trust agreement, an expense agreement, a junior subordinated

SVB Capital II will redeem the trust preferred securities on October 15,
2033, and may redeem them earlier, subject to prior approval by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, if then required by the capital rules of
the Federal Reserve Board.

Silicon Valley Bancshares
entered into the guarantee agreement concurrently with the issuance of the
trust preferred securities for the benefit of the holders of the trust
preferred securities. Wilmington Trust Company acts as guarantee trustee under
the guarantee agreement for the purposes of compliance with the Trust Indenture
Act, and the guarantee is qualified as an indenture under the Trust Indenture
Act. The guarantee trustee will hold the guarantee for the benefit of the
holders of the trust preferred securities.

Legal Matters

Certain lawsuits and
claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed or are
pending against the Company or its affiliates. Based upon information available
to the Company, its review of such claims to date and consultation with its
outside legal counsel, management believes the liability relating to these
actions, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
liquidity, consolidated financial position, or results of operations.

15.   Derivative
Financial Instruments

Derivative instruments that the Company uses as a part
of its interest rate risk management may include interest rate swaps, caps and
floors, and forward contracts. On October 30, 2003, the Company entered
into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $50.0 million. This
agreement hedges against the risk of changes in fair values associated with the
majority of the Company’s 7.0% fixed rate, junior subordinated debentures. For
information on the Company’s junior subordinated debentures, s

ee Note 12. Borrowings.

The terms of this fair value hedge agreement provide
for a swap of the Company’s 7.0% fixed rate payment for a variable rate based
on London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. Because the swap meets
the criteria for the short-cut treatment, the benefit or expense is recorded in
the period incurred. This derivative agreement provided income of $2.2 million
in 2004. The swap agreement mirrors the terms of the junior subordinated
debentures and therefore is callable by the counterparty anytime after October 30,
2008. The Company assumes no ineffectiveness as the swap agreement meets the
short-cut method requirements under SFAS No. 133 for fair value hedges of
debt instruments. As a result, changes in the fair value of the swap are offset
by changes in the fair value of the junior subordinated debentures, and no net
gain or loss is recognized in earnings.

Changes
in the fair value of the derivative agreement and

the

junior
subordinated debentures

are primarily
dependent on changes in market interest rates. The derivative instrument had a
fair value of $0.1 million, which was recorded in other assets at December 31,
2004.

On May 15, 2003, the Company entered into a
convertible note hedge agreement (purchased call option) with a Counterparty
with respect to its common stock, to limit its exposure to potential dilution
from conversion of the Company’s $150.0 million principal amount of zero coupon
convertible notes. For information on the Company’s $150.0 million principal
amount of zero coupon convertible notes, see Note 12. Borrowings. Upon the
occurrence of conversion events, the Company has the right to purchase up to
approximately 4,460,410 of its common stock from the Counterparty at a price of
$33.6277 per common share. The convertible note hedge agreement will expire on June 15,
2008. The Company has the option to settle any amounts due under the
convertible hedge either in cash or net shares of its common stock. The cost of
the convertible note hedge is included in stockholders’ equity in accordance
with the guidance in EITF No. 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial
Instruments

Indexed to, and Potentially
Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock.

On June 3, 2002, the Company entered into an
interest swap agreement with a notional amount of $40.0 million. The swap was
terminated effective June 23, 2003. This agreement hedged against the risk
of changes in fair value associated with the Company’s $40.0 million, 8.25%
fixed rate, trust preferred securities. The 8.25% trust preferred securities
were redeemed in December 2003. This derivative agreement provided a
benefit of $1.0 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts, see Note 20.

16.   Common Stock Repurchases

$160.0 million share repurchase program authorized by
the Company’s board of directors, effective May 7, 2003

On May 7, 2003, the Company announced that its
board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $160.0
million. This program became effective immediately and replaced previously
announced stock repurchase programs. Under this program, the Company
repurchased in aggregate 0.3 million shares of common stock totaling $12.6
million in 2004. In 2003, the Company repurchased in aggregate 4.5 million
shares of common stock totaling $113.2 million. On May 20, 2003, the
Company purchased 1.3 million shares of common stock for approximately $33.4
million in conjunction with the Company’s convertible note offering. Additionally,
during the three months ended June 30, 2003, the Company entered into an
accelerated stock repurchase (ASR) agreement for 3.2 million shares at an
initial price of $79.9 million. The Company completed its settlement
obligations under this ASR agreement in the third quarter of 2003.

The approximate value of
shares that may still be repurchased under this program totaled $34.2 million
as of December 31, 2004.

$100.0 million share repurchase program authorized by
the Company’s board of directors on September 16, 2002

From its inception through
its termination on May 7, 2003, the Company repurchased 5.2 million shares
of common stock totaling $94.3 million in conjunction with the $100.0 million
share repurchase program. Under this program, the Company had repurchased 3.3
million shares of common stock totaling


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

$59.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2002. A portion of the shares
repurchased under this program was completed under an ASR agreement.

$50.0 million share repurchase program authorized by
the Company’s board of directors on March 21, 2002

For the year ended December 31,
2002, the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares of common stock totaling $50.2
million in conjunction with this program.

Accelerated Stock Repurchase Agreements

In May 2003, January 2003, and November 2002,
the Company entered into ASR agreements to facilitate the repurchase of shares
of its common stock. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had completed
all of its settlement obligations under these ASR agreements. The Company
repurchased 3.2 million, 1.7 million, and 2.3 million shares of its common
stock from the counterparties for $79.9 million, $29.9 million, and $40.0
million under the ASR agreements of May 2003, January 2003, and November 2002,
respectively. Each of these agreements had five-year terms. During the term of
the ASR agreements, the Company had an obligation to sell shares to the Counterparty
equal to the number of shares the Company purchased from them at the outset of
the agreement. The Company had the option to fulfill its obligation either by
buying shares in the open market and selling those shares to the Counterparty
at forward prices specified in the agreement or by issuing new shares and
remitting them to the Counterparty in exchange for the forward price. The
forward price was based on a formula that began with the price of the initial
purchase and was adjusted for fees and commissions and the length of time from
the initial purchase to when shares were sold or delivered to the Counterparty.
The Company had complete discretion as to the timing and number of shares that
the Company sold to the Counterparty subject to a cumulative minimum of 20.0%
by the end of each year of the agreement. Under the ASR agreements, if the
Company was required to pay the Counterparty and elected to settle its
obligation in shares, the number of shares to be issued by the Company was
capped.

The Company accounted for
initial payment under the ASR agreements as a purchase of treasury stock, and
the Company subsequently retired those shares. Prior to June 15, 2003, the
effective date of SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity” the Company
accounted for ASR agreements under the EITF No. 99-7, “Accounting for an
Accelerated Share Repurchase Program.” EITF No. 99-7 provided that an
entity should account for an accelerated stock repurchase program as two
separate transactions: (a) as shares of common stock acquired in a
treasury stock transaction recorded on the acquisition date and (b) as a
forward contract indexed to its own common stock. The forward contract was to
be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of EITF No. 00-19, “Accounting
for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a
Company’s Own Stock.” As of December 31, 2004, the Company had fulfilled
all its obligations under the ASR agreements in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No. 150.

more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through
recovery of taxes previously paid and/or future taxable income.

Equity Incentive Plans

Each of the Company’s active stock option plans has
been approved by its stockholders. The Company’s 1997 Equity Incentive Plan
(the 1997 Plan), provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees
and nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock
purchase awards, stock bonuses, and restricted stock units (collectively Stock
Awards) to employees, directors and consultants The 1997 Plan provides a means
by which selected employees and directors of, and consultants to, the Company
and its affiliates, may be given an opportunity to purchase common stock of the
Company or receive cash based on stock appreciation. The Company, by means of
the 1997 Plan, seeks to retain the services of persons who are now employees
and directors of, or consultants to, the Company or its affiliates; to secure
and retain the services of new employees, directors, and consultants; and to
provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of
the Company and its affiliates.

The
table below provides stock option information related to the 1989 Stock Option
Plan and the 1997 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and
2002:


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The
following table summarizes information regarding stock options outstanding as
of December 31, 2004:

At December 31, 2004, options for 1,449,778
shares were available for future grant under the 1997 Plan. The Company’s 1989
stock option plan expired in 1999. No future grants will be made under the 1989
Plan.

The 1997 Plan provides for the granting of shares of
the Company’s common stock to directors, employees, and consultants. Shares
granted under this plan may be subject to certain vesting requirements and
resale restrictions (“restricted stock”). For the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, the Company issued 156,025 shares of restricted stock at a
weighted-average fair value of $36.807 per share and 116,777 shares at a
weighted-average fair value of $17.24 per share, respectively. For the year
ended December 31, 2002, the Company did not issue restricted stock. At December 31,
2004, there were 251,113 shares of restricted stock outstanding, the vesting of
these shares occurs on various dates through the years ending December 31,
2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008.

The Company recognized $2.6 million, $1.0 million and
$0.8 million in employee and non-employee stock-based compensation costs
resulting from the amortization of unearned compensation related to restricted
stock and other miscellaneous employee and non-employee stock awards for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

If compensation cost related to both the Company’s
stock option awards to employees and directors and to the ESPP had been
determined under the fair value method prescribed under SFAS No. 123, the
Company’s net income, basic earnings per share, and diluted earnings per share
would have been reduced by $15.9 million, $18.8 million and $16.9 million, for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The
fair value of the stock option grants used in determining the pro forma net
income and the basic and diluted earnings per share amounts were estimated
using the Black-Scholes single option-pricing model with the following average
assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002:

The expected volatility of
the Company’s underlying common stock was calculated using a one-year term. The
expected risk-free interest rate is equal to the 5 year yield on Treasury
Securities as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Incentive Compensation Plan

Incentive Compensation
Plans (ICP) are bonus programs paid based on the financial results of various
business units of the Company. Awards are distributed based on management’s
assessment of individual employee performance. The Company’s contributions to
ICP were $28.6 million, $12.6 million, and $5.3 million for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan

Direct Drive Incentive
Compensation Plan (Direct Drive) is a semiannual sales incentive program. Payments
are based on sales teams’ performance to predetermined financial targets. Actual
awards for each sales team member under Direct Drive is based on (i) the
actual results and financial performance of the Company with respect to the
gross profit targets, (ii) the sales team payout targets, and (iii) the
sales team member’s sales position and team payout allocation. Additionally,
sales team members may receive a discretionary award based on management’s
assessment of such member’s contributions and performance during the applicable
fiscal year, regardless of achievement of team gross profit targets. The
Company’s contributions to Direct Drive were $5.1 million, $3.5 million and
$0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Silicon Valley Bank 401(k) and Employee Stock
Ownership Plan

The Silicon Valley Bank 401(k) (the 401(k) Plan)
and Employee Stock Ownership (ESOP) Plan (collectively referred to as the Plan)
is a combined 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan and employee stock
ownership plan in which all regular employees of the Company are eligible to
participate.

2003, the Company matches the employee’s contributions dollar-for-dollar, up to
5% of the employee’s pre-tax compensation as defined in the Plan. The Company’s
matching contributions vest immediately. Prior to January 1, 2003, the
Company matched up to $1,000 of an employee’s contributions per annum, which
vested at 20% per year. The Company’s matching 401(k) Plan contributions
totaled $3.6 million, $3.0 million, and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31,
2004,

respectively. The amount of salary deferred is not subject to federal or state
income taxes at the time of deferral.

Effective December 31, 2002, the Company merged
the Silicon Valley Bank Money Purchase Pension Plan (the MPP Plan) balances
into the 401(k) Plan, which continued to vest at 20% per year. The Company
has not made contributions towards the MPP Plan for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, and will not in the future. Prior to December 31, 2002, the
MPP Plan guaranteed a quarterly contribution to all individuals who were
employed by the Company on the first and last day of a fiscal quarter. The
Company contributed cash in an amount equal to 5.0% of an eligible employee’s
quarterly base salary, less Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 401(k) and
Section 125 deferrals. The Company’s contributions to the MPP Plan totaled
$3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Discretionary ESOP contributions, based on the Company’s
net income, are made by the Company to all eligible individuals employed by the
Company on the last day of the fiscal year. The Company may elect to contribute
cash, or the Company’s common stock, in an amount not exceeding 10.0% of the
employee’s eligible compensation earned in the fiscal year. The ESOP
contributions vest in equal annual increments over five years.

The Company’s contributions to the ESOP totaled $6.8
million, $3.8 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2004, the ESOP owned
1,051,006 shares of the Company’s common stock. All shares held by the ESOP are
treated as outstanding shares in both the Company’s basic and diluted earnings
per share computations. At December 31, 2004, the Company had not
committed any shares to the ESOP program.

The Company amended the
Plan in 2004 and added a Profit Sharing Account, which is employee directed. Discretionary
Profit Sharing Contributions, subject to determination by the company, will be
made to all eligible individuals who are employed by the Company on the last
day of the fiscal year. The company had not made any contributions in 2004 and
prior years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company maintains an
employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) under which participating employees may
annually contribute up to 10% of their gross compensation to purchase shares of
the Company’s common stock at 85% of its fair market value at either the
beginning or end of each six-month offering period, whichever price is less. All
employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the ESPP. The ESPP is
noncompensatory to the employees and results in no expense to the Company under
APB 25. For periods beginning after June 15, 2005, the Company will be
required to recognize compensation expense in accordance with SFAS 123R. See
Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 2—Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies. For the first six-month offering period of 2004, 66,012
shares of the Company’s common stock were issued at $31.314 per share, while
50,116 shares of the Company’s common stock were issued at $33.32 per share for
the second six-month offering period of 2004. At December 31, 2004, a
total of 1,099,945 shares of the Company’s common stock were reserved for
future issuance under the ESPP.

Employee Home Ownership Plan

In 2002, the Company approved the Employee Home
Ownership Plan (EHOP), which is a benefit plan that provides for the issuance
of mortgage loans at favorable interest rates to eligible employees. Eligible
employees may apply for a fixed-rate mortgage which is amortized over 30 years
and is due and payable in either five or seven years on their primary residence.
Applicants must qualify for a loan through

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

the usual mortgage review
and approval process, which is typical of industry standards. The maximum loan
amount cannot be greater than 80.0% of the lesser of the purchase price or the
appraised value. The interest rate on the note is written at the then market
rate for five year (5/1) or seven year (7/1) mortgage loans as determined by
the Company. However, provided that the applicant continues to meet all the
eligibility requirements, including employment at the Company, the actual rate
charged to the borrower shall be 2.0% below the market rate. The loan rate
shall not be less than 25 basis points over the greater of either the five-year
Treasury Note rate or the monthly Applicable Federal Rate for medium-term loans
as published by the Internal Revenue Service. The loan rate will be fixed at
the time of approval and locked for 30 days. The Company recognizes as
compensation expense the aggregate dollar amount by which interest charged to
an employee under the EHOP is less than the market rate of interest that would
be charged for a comparable loan. However, loans under the EHOP typically
contain contractual provisions that limit the extent of this discrepancy, if
any. As a consequence, compensation expense attributable to loans issued under
the EHOP for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was immaterial.

The
following table summarizes the activities of EHOP loans to all employees for
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003:

SVB Qualified Investors Fund LLC

In late 2000, the Company
formed SVB Qualified Investor Fund LLC, on behalf of certain eligible employees.
The fund was initially fully capitalized by equity contributions by employees. The
funds principal purpose is to invest in a select number of private equity funds
managed primarily by Silicon Valley Bancshares or its affiliates. The fund will
continue until December 12, 2013, unless terminated sooner or extended in
accordance with the fund operating agreement. The Company incurred fund
administration costs of approximately $0.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2004 and $0.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002.

Deferred Compensation Plan

On October 20, 2004,
the Compensation Committee of the board of directors of the Company approved
the Silicon Valley Bank Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan). The Plan became
effective on January 1, 2005. Under the Plan, eligible employees of the
Company may elect to defer up to 25% of their base salary and/or up to 100% of
any bonus payment to which they are entitled, for a period of twelve
consecutive months, beginning January 1 and ending December 31. Executive
officers and certain senior managers are eligible to participate in the Plan,
and any amounts deferred under the Plan will be invested and administered by
the Company (or such person as the Company designates).

19.   Related Parties

Loan Transactions

Prior to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the
Board of the Bank adopted a policy in November 2001 to permit loans to be
made to directors or to a company owned or controlled by a director (“Director
Loans”). Director Loans would qualify for an exemption from Section 402 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as they would be made out of the Bank and would be
subject to the insider lending restrictions of section 22(h) of the
Federal Reserve Act.

The Director Loans policy authorizes the Executive
Committee of the Board, along with the Chief Credit Officer, to approve
Director Loans. Under the Director Loans policy, an outside credit review firm
will be responsible for grading a Director Loan throughout its term. If the
credit review firm classifies a Director Loan as “Special Mention” (as defined
in the Bank’s existing loan policy), such director is required to discuss the
director’s plans to bring the loan back to “pass” status with the Executive
Committee within thirty days of the downgrade of the loan. The policy further
provides that if a Director Loan is classified as “Substandard” (as defined in
the Bank’s existing loan policy) by the outside credit review firm, such
director will have thirty days (with the Executive Committee having the
authority to give the director up to sixty days) to upgrade the loan to “pass”
status or resign from the Board. The Company believes that all extensions of
credit included in such transactions will be made in compliance with applicable
laws and on substantially the same terms, including interest rates, collateral
and repayment terms, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with other persons of similar creditworthiness and, in the opinion
of the board of directors of the Bank, will not involve more than a normal risk
of collectibility or default or present any other unfavorable features.

In August 2000, the Bank extended a line of
credit in the amount of $0.03 million to Gregory and Michaela Rodeno, dba Villa
Ragazzi. Ms. Rodeno is a director of the Company, and Mr. Rodeno is
her husband. No amounts were outstanding under the line during 2004. The line
of credit expired in October 2004 and had an interest rate of the Bank’s
prime rate, plus 150 basis points.

In December 2000, the Bank made a loan in the
amount of $1.0 million to St. Supery Vineyards and Winery. The loan amount was
increased to $3.0 million in October 2001, further increased to $4.0
million in February 2002, and further increased to $6.0 million in February 2003.
Michaela Rodeno, a director of the Company, is the Chief Executive Officer of
St. Supery. The loan matured in November 2004, with interest payable
monthly, but was paid off in full in September 2004. The loan was secured
by the accounts receivable and inventory of St. Supery. The largest principal
amount outstanding during 2004 was $5.0 million. The loan had an interest rate
at the Bank’s prime rate, less 37.5 basis points.

In August 2001, the Company made an interest-free
loan in the amount of $0.5 million to Marc Verissimo, Chief Strategy
Officer, to assist in the purchase of his primary residence. The loan matures
in March 2006 and is unsecured. The largest principal amount outstanding
during 2004 (and the principal amount outstanding on December 31, 2004)
was $0.5 million.

In September 2001, the Bank made a loan in the
amount of $8.0 million to H.A. Schupf & Co., LLC for the purchase of
the company back from Reich and Tang Asset Management LP, an investment
adviser. In May 2004, the loan was increased to $10.9 million. The loan
matures in June 2007, with interest payable monthly, but was paid off in
full in December 2004. The loan was secured by the assets of H.A. Schupf &
Co., LLC. The largest principal amount outstanding during 2004 was $10.9
million. The loan bears an interest rate of the Bank’s prime rate, and is
personally guaranteed by Mr. H.A. Schupf, the managing member of H.A.
Schupf and Co., LLC. At December 31, 2004, H.A. Schupf & Co., LLC
is a principal

In December 2003, the Bank made a loan in the
amount of $2.0 million to National Contract Associates, Inc. The loan
matured in December 2004 but was extended for one year to December 2005,
with interest payable monthly. The largest principal amount outstanding during
2004 was $1.7 million. The loan bears an interest rate of the bank’s prime
rate, plus 200 basis points. The loan is personally guaranteed by Mr. H.A.
Schupf, whose son-in-law is an officer of the borrower.

In November 2000, the Bank made a loan in the
amount of $32.3 million to NEA Partners, a venture firm of which Mr. Kramlich,
a director of the Company, is a General Partner and Co-Founder. The loan
matured in January 2005, with interest payable monthly, but was paid off
in full in August 2004. The largest outstanding balance during 2004 was
$21.8 million. The loan had an interest rate of the Bank’s prime rate, plus 100
basis points.

During 2004, the Bank made
loans to certain companies in which certain venture funds with which some of
our directors are affiliated, are beneficial owners of ten percent or more of
the equity securities of such companies. Such loans: (a) were made in the
ordinary course of business, (b) were made on substantially the same
terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time
for comparable transactions with other persons, and (c) did not involve
more than the normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable
features.

Fund Investments

In 2000, the Company created two venture investment
funds: the SVB Investor Strategic Investors Fund, LP (“SIF”) and the Silicon
Valley BancVentures, LP (“SVBV”). SIF is a $121.8 million venture fund of funds
that invests in other venture funds and SVBV is a $56.1 million direct equity
investment fund that invests in privately-held companies. Both funds are
managed by their respective general partners, which are wholly-owned
subsidiaries of the Company and hold a minority interest in the respective
funds. Certain of our directors have also invested in the funds and hold a
minority interest: Messrs. Hardymon (through his family partnership) ($0.9
million), Burns ($0.5 million) and Porter ($0.5 million) are limited partners
of SIF, and Messrs. Hardymon (through a family limited partnership) ($1.5
million), Burns ($0.3 million) and Kramlich ($1.0 million) are limited partners
of SVBV. Mr. H.A. Schupf, a principal stockholder of the Company, is also
a limited partner of SVBV ($0.5 million).

In 2000, the Company created the SVB Qualified
Investor Fund LLC (“QIF”), a $7.6 million investment fund for employees that
met certain eligibility requirements. To be eligible to participate in QIF, an
employee must be of a certain grade level and must be a “qualified investor,”
as such term is defined by the SEC. QIF was initially capitalized by
commitments and contributions from certain eligible employees including the
Company’s senior management. All employee participants are required to invest
in this fund with their own money, but the Company manages the fund and pays
all administrative costs associated with the fund. QIF’s principal purpose is
to invest in a select number of private equity funds managed primarily by the
Company or its affiliates. Messrs. Wilcox, Becker, Hardin, Jenkins-Stark,
Kellogg, Verissimo and Witte are current participants in QIF.

In 2003, Gold Hill Venture
Lending 03, LP, a venture debt fund, and certain affiliated funds (the “Gold
Hill Funds”) were created. The total size of the Gold Hill Funds is
approximately $214.1 million. The Company is a controlling member of the
general partner of the Gold Hill Funds, as well as a limited partner of the
Gold Hill Funds. The combined commitment total of the Company in the general
partner and the Gold Hill Funds is $20 million. Certain of the Company’s
directors are also limited partners of the Gold Hill Funds and hold a minority
interest: Mr. Hardymon ($2.5 million) and Ms. Rodeno ($0.2 million).

Other Relationships

Messrs. Dunbar and Kramlich, directors of the
Company, served as advisory directors since January 2001 and July 2003,
respectively.

Additionally, certain
borrowings described under “

Note 12—

Borrowings”
are due to the selling partners of SVB Alliant (Alliant Partners), who became
employees of the Company.

20.   Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees, and Other Commitments

In the normal course of
business, the Company uses financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to
meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include
commitments to extend credit, commercial and standby letters of credit, foreign
exchange options, and foreign exchange forward contracts. These instruments
involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. Credit risk is defined as
the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial
instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract.

Commitments to Extend Credit

A commitment to extend
credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no
violation of any condition established in the agreement. Such commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates, or other termination clauses, and
usually require a fee paid by the client upon the Company issuing the
commitment. Commitments which are available for funding, due to clients meeting
all collateral, compliance, and financial covenants required under loan
commitment agreements, totaled $2.7 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Out of these available commitment balances, the
fixed-rate commitments were $257.2 million and $167.9 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company’s exposure arising from interest rate
risk associated with fixed-rate loan commitments is not considered material. Commitments
which are unavailable for funding, due to clients not meeting all collateral,
compliance, and financial covenants required under loan commitment agreements,
totaled $0.7 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The Company’s potential exposure to credit loss, in the event of
nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument, is the
contractual amount of the available unused loan commitment. The Company uses
the same credit approval and monitoring process in extending loan commitments
as it does in making loans. The actual liquidity needs or the credit risk that
the Company has experienced have historically been lower than the contractual
amount of commitments to extend credit because a significant portion of these
commitments expire without being drawn upon. The Company evaluates each
potential borrower and the necessary collateral on an individual basis. The
type of collateral varies, but may include real property, bank deposits, or
business and personal assets. The potential credit risk associated with these
commitments is considered in management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the
allowance for contingent loan losses. Additionally, the Company had aggregate
maximum lending limits of $478.7 million as of December 31, 2004
related to its accounts receivable factoring arrangements. The Company extends
credit under


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

accounts
receivable factoring arrangements when its clients’ sales invoices are deemed
credit worthy under existing underwriting practices.

Commercial and Standby Letters of Credits

Commercial and standby letters of credit represent
conditional commitments issued by the Company on behalf of a client to
guarantee the performance of the client to a third party when certain specified
future events have occurred. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily
for inventory purchases by client and are typically short-term in nature. The
Company provides two types of standby letter of credit: performance and
financial standby letter of credits. Performance standby letters of credit are
issued to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party when certain
specified future events have occurred. Performance standby letters of credit
are primarily used to support performance instruments such as bid bonds,
performance bonds, lease obligations, repayment of loans, and past due notices.
Financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the
Company to guarantee the payment by a client to a third party (beneficiary). Financial
standby letters of credit are primarily used to support many types of domestic
and international payments. These standby letters of credit have fixed
expiration dates and generally require a fee paid by a client at the time the
Company issues the commitment. Fees generated from these standby letters of
credit are recognized in noninterest income over the commitment period.

The credit risk involved
in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with
extending loan commitments to clients, and accordingly, the Company uses a
credit evaluation process and collateral requirements similar to those for loan
commitments. The Company’s standby letters of credit often are cash secured by
its clients. The actual liquidity needs or the credit risk that the Company has
experienced historically have been lower than the contractual amount of letters
of credit issued because a significant portion of these conditional commitments
expire without being drawn upon.

Obligation Under Guarantees

The
table below summarizes the Company’s standby letter of credits at December 31,
2004. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the amount
that could be lost under the standby letters of credit if there were a total
default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries
under recourse provisions or from the collateral held or pledged.

At December 31, 2004, the carrying amount of the
liabilities related to financial and performance standby letters of credit was
approximately $3.4 million. At December 31, 2004, cash and investment
securities collateral available to the Company to reimburse losses under
financial and performance standby letters of credits was $284.8 million.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In addition to
standby letter of credit guarantees, the Company have issues additional
guarantees as off-balance sheet arrangement. As of December 31, 2004,
those guarantees include the following:

·

The
Bank has guaranteed credit cards issued to our clients by an unaffiliated
financial institution. As of December 31, 2004, the combined credit limits
on those accounts are $44.5 million.

·

The
Company may be required to make contingent payments to the former owners of
Woodside Asset Management based on their future revenue growth. During 2004,
the Company paid one earn-out payment of $338,000 to the former owners of
Woodside Asset Management. As of December 31, 2004, under the acquisition
agreement, the maximum future gross earn-out payments to Woodside Asset
Management’s former owners are $1.6 million.

Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward
contracts and non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts with clients
involved in international trade finance activities, either as the purchaser or
seller of foreign currency at a future date, depending upon the clients’ need. For
each of the foreign exchange forward contracts and non-deliverable foreign
exchange forward contracts entered into with its clients, the Company enters
into an opposite way foreign exchange forward contract and non-deliverable
foreign exchange forward contract with a correspondent bank to hedge it, which
completely mitigates the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. These contracts are short-term in nature, typically expiring within on
year. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the notional amounts of these
contracts totaled $377.3 million and $95.4 million, respectively. The maximum
credit exposure for counterparty nonperformance for foreign exchange forward
contracts and non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts with both
clients and correspondent banks amounted to $37.7 million at December 31,
2004 and $9.5 million at December 31, 2003. The Company has not
experienced nonperformance by counterparty and therefore has not incurred
related losses. Further, the Company anticipates performance by all
counterparties to such agreements.

The Company makes foreign
currency loans to clients based in the United Kingdom. The Company enters into
foreign exchange forward contracts with correspondent banks to hedge the
foreign exchange exposure related to these loans. These contracts are short
term in nature, typically expiring within one year. At December 31, 2004,
the notional amounts of these contracts totaled $25.8 million. The maximum
credit exposure for counterparty nonperformance for foreign exchange forward
contracts related to the Company’s foreign exchange loans amounted to $2.6
million at December 31, 2004. There were no foreign exchange forward
contracts related to foreign exchange loans in 2003. The Company has not
experienced nonperformance by counterparty and therefore has not incurred
related losses. Further, the Company anticipates performance by all
counterparties to such foreign exchange forward contracts.

Foreign Currency Option Contracts

The Company enters into
foreign currency option contracts with clients involved in international trade
finance activities, either as the purchaser or seller of foreign currency
options, depending upon the client’s need. For each of the currency option
contracts entered into with its clients, the Company enters into an opposite
way foreign currency option contract with a correspondent bank, which
completely mitigates the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. These contracts typically expire in less than one year. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, the notional amounts of these contracts totaled $13.5 million
and $21.1 million, respectively. The Company has not experienced nonperformance
by counterparty and therefore has not incurred related losses. Further, the
Company anticipates performance by all counterparties.

Commitments to Invest in Venture Capital Funds

The Company makes
commitments to venture capital fund investments, which in turn make investments
in privately held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally
made up to a ten-year period from the inception of the venture capital fund.
The timing of future cash requirements to fund such commitments is generally
dependent upon the venture capital investment cycle, the overall market
conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held
companies operate. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had remaining
unfunded commitments of $15.9 million to wholly owned venture capital fund
investments and $39.6 million and $55.2 million to venture capital fund
investments through the funds of funds, SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP and
SVB Strategic Investors Fund II, LP, respectively. The Company has committed
capital of $13.5 million to SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP, representing an
ownership interest of 11.1%. As of December 31, 2004, the remaining
unfunded commitment to the fund was $5.7 million. The Company also has
committed capital of $15.0 million to SVB Strategic Investors Fund II, LP,
representing an ownership interest of 14.4%. As of December 31, 2004, the
remaining unfunded commitment to the fund was $13.5 million. The Company made a
capital commitment of $6.0 million to its venture capital fund, Silicon Valley
BancVentures, LP in which the Company has an ownership interest of 10.7%. The
remaining unfunded commitment to the fund was $2.9 million as of December 31,
2004. The Company made a capital commitment of $25.0 million to the venture
debt fund, Partners for Growth, LP in which the Company has an ownership
interest of 53.2%. As of December 31, 2004, the remaining unfunded
commitment to the fund was $20.3 million. In addition, the Company has
committed capital of $20.0 million to Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP in which
the Company has an ownership interest of 9.3%. The remaining unfunded
commitment to the fund was $15.4 million.

21.   Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments”, requires that the Company disclose estimated fair
values for its financial instruments. Fair value estimates, methods and
assumptions, set forth below for the Company’s financial instruments, are made
solely to comply with the requirements of SFAS No. 107.

Fair values are based on estimates or calculations at
the transaction level using present value techniques in instances where quoted
market prices are not available. Because broadly traded markets do not exist
for many of the Company’s financial instruments, the fair value calculations
attempt to incorporate the effect of current market conditions at a specific
time. Fair valuations are management’s estimates of the values, and they are
calculated based on current pricing policies, the economic and competitive
environment, the characteristics of the financial instruments, expected losses,
and other such factors. These calculations are subjective in nature, involve
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and do not include tax
ramifications; therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision or
substantiated by comparison to independent markets, and they may not be
realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the instruments. There
may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the
underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future
cash flows, could significantly affect the results. For all of these reasons,
the aggregation of the fair value calculations presented herein does not
represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of
the Company.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The
following describes the methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair
values of financial instruments.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

This category includes
cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial
institutions, federal funds sold, and securities purchased under agreement to
resell. The cash equivalents are readily convertible to known amounts of cash
and present insignificant risk of changes in value due to maturity dates of 90
days or less. For these short-term financial instruments, the carrying amount
is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Investment
Securities

For marketable investment
securities classified as available-for-sale, fair values are based on quoted
market prices provided by a known and reputable pricing service or dealer
quotes. The Company records its wholly owned non-marketable venture capital
fund investments and other private equity investments on a cost basis less any
identified impairment. For the Company’s venture capital fund, its funds of
funds, SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP and its venture debt funds, the Company
records the non-marketable venture capital fund investments and other private
equity investments at fair value using investment accounting rules (see
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies—Marketable Equity Securities).

Loans

The fair value of fixed
and variable rate loans is estimated by discounting contractual cash flows
using discount rates that reflect the Company’s current pricing for loans and
the forward yield curve.

Deposits

The fair value of interest
bearing deposits is estimated by discounting the deposit balances using the
Company’s cost of borrowing funds in the market and the forward yield curve. The
deposit portfolio was segregated by core and non-core deposits. In addition,
the duration and interest rate sensitivity of the individual deposit accounts
was taken into account in determining the fair value.

Borrowings

The fair value of
borrowings is estimated based on quoted market prices for the issues for which
there is a market. Otherwise, the fair value of borrowings is calculated by
discounting the contractual cash flows using the forward yield curve.

Foreign Exchange
Forward Contracts

The Company enters into
foreign exchange forward contracts with clients involved in international trade
finance activities, either as the purchaser or seller of foreign currency at a
future date, depending upon the clients’ need. The Company enters into an
opposite way foreign exchange forward contract with a correspondent bank to
hedge these contracts, which completely mitigates the risk of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, for each of the foreign exchange forward
contracts entered into with our clients. The Company also enters into foreign
exchange forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange exposure related to
loans denominated in foreign currencies.

Interest Rate Swap

This agreement hedges
against the risk of changes in fair value associated with the majority of the
Company’s 7.0% fixed rate, junior subordinated debentures.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments

The fair value of unfunded commitments to extend
credit is estimated based on the average amount the Company would receive or
pay to execute a new agreement with identical terms, considering current
interest rates and taking into account the remaining terms of the agreement and
counterparties’ credit standing.

Letters of credit
generally expire in 90 days or less, therefore their fair value was estimated
at cost at December 31, 2004 and 2003, due to their short-term nature. Commitments
to extend credit and letters of credit typically result in loans with a market
interest rate when funded.

Limitations

The information presented herein is based on pertinent
information available to the Company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. Although
management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the
estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively
revalued since the most recent year end, and the estimated fair values of these
financial instruments may have changed significantly since that point in time.

The
estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments at December 31,
2004 and 2003 are presented below.

22.   Regulatory Matters

The Bank is subject to certain restrictions on the
amount of dividends that it may declare without the prior approval of the
Federal Reserve Board and the California Department of Financial Institutions. At
December 31, 2004, none of the Bank’s retained earnings were available for
dividend declaration to the Company without prior regulatory approval.

The Company and the Bank are subject to capital
adequacy guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve Board. Failure to meet
minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly
additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have
a material impact on the Company’s and/or the Bank’s financial condition and
results of operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory
framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet
specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s
and the Bank’s balance sheet items, as well as certain off-balance sheet items,
as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s and the Bank’s
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments
by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.

Under these capital guidelines, the minimum total
risk-based capital ratio and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirements are
10.0% and 6.0%, respectively, of risk-weighted assets and certain off-balance
sheet items for a well-capitalized depository institution.

The Federal Reserve Board has also established minimum
capital leverage ratio guidelines for state member banks. The ratio is
determined using Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets. The
guidelines require a minimum of 5.0% for a well-capitalized depository
institution.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The
following table presents the capital ratios for the Company and the bank, as
compared to the minimum regulatory capital requirements for an adequately
capitalized depository institution, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003:

23.   Stockholders’ Rights Plan

On October 22, 1998, the Company’s board of
directors (the “Board”) approved and adopted a stockholders’ rights plan (the “Rights
Plan”) to, among other things, protect the Company’s stockholders from coercive
takeover tactics. On November 6, 2003, the Board approved and adopted
Amendment No. 1 to the Rights Plan agreement to increase from 10% to 15%
the minimum percentage of common shares that any person shall beneficially own
to qualify as an “Acquiring Person” for purposes of triggering the stockholders’
rights under the Rights Plan. On January 29, 2004, the Board approved and
adopted an amended and restated Rights Plan (the “Amended and Restated Rights
Plan”), which supersedes and replaces in entirety the Rights Plan, and was later
amended on August 2, 2004, to change the expiration date of the plan from January 31,
2014 to January 31, 2008.

The following summary of the Rights and the Amended
and Restated Rights Plan is a general description only and is subject to the
detailed terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan, a copy
of which is attached as Exhibits 4.12 and 4.13 to the Company’s amended and
restated registration statement on Form 8-A/A, filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2004 and August 3,
2004, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. Each capitalized term
used but not defined below has the meaning ascribed to such term in the Amended
and Restated Rights Plan.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Under the Amended and Restated Rights Plan, each stockholder
of record on November 9, 1998 received a dividend of one right (a “Right”)
for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company. The Rights are
attached to, and presently only traded with, shares of the Company’s common
stock and are not currently exercisable. Except as specified below, upon
becoming exercisable, each Right will entitle the holder to purchase from the
Company 1/1000th of a share of the Company’s Series A Participating
Preferred Stock at a price of $100.00 per share.

The Rights will become exercisable and begin to trade
separately from shares of the Company’s common stock upon the earlier of:  (i) the tenth (10th) business day (or
such later date as may be determined by action of the Company’s board of directors)
following a public announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common
stock, or (ii) the close of business on the tenth (10th) business day (or
such later date as may be determined by action of the Company’s board of directors)
following the commencement of, or announcement of a tender offer or exchange
offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a
person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s
common stock.

Unless the Rights are earlier redeemed, in the event
that an a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding
shares of the Company’s common stock, then each Right which has not theretofore
been exercised (other than the Rights beneficially owned by the acquiring
person, which will thereafter be void) will thereafter entitle the holder to
receive, upon exercise, common shares having a value equal to two times the
exercise price of the Right.

Similarly, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed, in
the event that a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of
the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, (i) the Company is
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, or (ii) 50%
or more of the Company’s consolidated assets or earning power are sold (other
than in transactions in the ordinary course of business), then each Right which
has not theretofore been exercised (other than the Rights beneficially owned by
the acquiring person, which will thereafter be void) will thereafter entitle
the holder to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock of the acquiring
company having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right. The
Company’s board of directors has the option any time after a person or group
becomes a 15% holder of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock to
exchange all or part of the Rights (other than Rights held by the acquiring
person) for shares of common stock of the Company provided that the Company
does not make such an exchange after the person becomes the beneficial owner of
50% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock.

At any time on or prior to
the close of business on the earlier of (i) the fifth day following a
public announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of
15% or more of the outstanding common shares (or such later date as may be
determined by action of the Company’s board of directors and publicly announced
by the Company) and (ii) January 31, 2008, the Company may redeem the
Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per Right, subject to
adjustment.

24.   Segment Reporting

In accordance with SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” the Company reports
segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach
designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and
assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Company is organized into four lines of banking
and financial services for management reporting:  Commercial Banking, SVB Capital, SVB Alliant,
and Private Client Services and Other. These operating segments are strategic
units that offer different services to different clients. The segments are
managed separately because they appeal to different markets and, accordingly,
require different strategies. The results of operating segments are based on
the Company’s internal profitability reporting process. This process assigns
each client relationship in its entirety, to a primary operating segment. The
process assigns income and expenses to the operating segments according to the
customer’s primary relationship designation. Additionally, working capital and
its associated costs are allocated to the operating segments on an economic
basis, treating each operating segment as if it were an independent entity. Unlike
financial reporting, which benefits from the comprehensive structure provided by
generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America, the
internal profitability reporting process is highly subjective, as there is no
comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. The management
reporting process measures the performance of operating segments based on the
Company’s internal operating structure and is not necessarily comparable with
similar information for other financial services companies. Changes in the
management structure and/or the allocation process have resulted, and may in
the future result in, changes in the Company’s allocation methodology as this
process is under constant refinement. In the event of such changes, results for
prior periods have been, and may be, restated for comparability. Changes in an
individual client’s primary relationship designation have resulted, and may in
the future result, in certain client’s inclusion in different segments in
different periods.

As of December 31, 2004, based on the
quantitative threshold for determining reportable segments as required by SFAS No. 131,
the Company’s reportable segments are: 
Commercial Banking, SVB Capital, and SVB Alliant. Private Client
Services does not meet the separate reporting thresholds as defined by SFAS No. 131
and as such, has been combined with Other Business Services for segment
reporting purposes.

Commercial Banking provides solutions to the needs of
the Company’s commercial clients in the technology, life science, and premium
wine industry niches, through the Company’s lending, cash and deposit
management, and global banking and trade products and services. Lending
products and services provide the Company’s commercial clients with loans and
other credit facilities, most often secured by the Company’s clients’ assets. Lending
products and services include traditional term loans, equipment loans,
revolving lines of credit, accounts-receivable based lines of credit,
asset-based loans, real estate loans, vineyard development loans, and financing
of affordable housing projects. The Company often obtains warrants to purchase
an equity position in a client company’s stock in consideration for making
loans, and for the provision of certain other associated lending services.

Within the Commercial Banking segment, the cash
management services unit provides deposit account and cash management products
and services, providing the Company’s commercial clients with short and
long-term cash management solutions. Deposit account products and services
include traditional deposit and checking accounts, certificates of deposit, and
money market accounts. In connection with deposit accounts, the Company also
provides lockbox and merchant services that facilitate quicker depositing of
checks and other payments to clients’ accounts. Cash management products and
services include wire transfer and Automated Clearing House (ACH) services to
enable clients to transfer funds quickly from their deposit accounts. Additionally,
cash management products and services include collection services, disbursement
services, electronic funds transfers (including ACH services), and online
banking through SVBeConnect.

Within the Commercial Banking segment, the
international services unit provides global trade products and services, to
facilitate the Company’s clients’ global finance and business needs. Global


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

banking and trade products
and services include foreign exchange services that empower commercial clients
to manage their foreign currency risks through purchases and sales of
currencies on the global inter-bank market. Also included are export trade
finance services and products, including a variety of loans and credit
facilities guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States to
facilitate the Company’s clients’ international trade, as well as a variety of
letters of credit, including export import, and standby letters of credit to
enable clients to ship and receive goods globally. Additionally, included are
products and services in international cash management.

Within the Commercial Banking Segment, Silicon Valley
Bank provides investment and advisory services through its broker-dealer
subsidiary SVB Securities. These services, which enable the Company’s clients
to manage their assets better, include mutual funds, fixed income securities,
and investment reporting and monitoring.

Within the Commercial Banking segment, Silicon Valley
Bank actively manages commercial client investment portfolios through SVB Asset
Management, one of its registered investment advisor subsidiaries, by providing
the Company’s commercial clients with customized cash and investment portfolio

advisory services,

based on the Company’s internal profitability reporting process to the
Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S generally
accepted accounting principles applicable to financial statements.

The
Company’s primary source of revenue is from net interest income. Accordingly,
the Company’s segments are reported using net interest income. The Company also
evaluates performance based on noninterest income and noninterest expense,
which are presented as components of segment operating profit or loss. The
Company does not allocate income taxes to its segments. Additionally, the
Company’s management reporting model is predicated on average asset balances,
therefore it is not possible to provide period-end asset balances for segment
reporting purposes. The Company’s segment information at and for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, are as follows:

(1)

For segment reporting purposes, the
Company reports net charge-offs as provision for loan losses. Thus, the Private
Client Service and Other segment includes $(12.3) million, $(8.4) million, and
$1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively, which represent the difference between net charge-offs and the
provision for loan losses.

(2)

Noninterest income presented in the SVB Capital segment
includes warrant income of $9.2 million, $7.5 million, and $1.7 million
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

(3)

The Commercial Banking segment included
direct depreciation and amortization of $1.4 million, $1.2 million, and $1.1
million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. Due to the complexity of the Company’s cost allocation model, it
is not feasible to determine the exact amount of the remaining depreciation and
amortization expense allocated to the various business segments totaling
approximately $7.1 million, $6.7 million, and $6.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

(4)

Total average assets for the Commercial
Banking and SVB Capital segments equal the greater of total loans or the sum of
total deposits and total stockholders’ equity for each segment.

A part of the dividends paid in 2003 and the dividend

has been required by the DFI to return to Silicon Valley Bank a portion the
2003 dividend and the 2004 dividend—the total amount returned totaled $28.4
million. At this time, Silicon Valley Bank must obtain prior approval from the
DFI before paying any further dividends to Bancshares.

From January 1, 2005 through March 3, 2005, the
Company repurchased 677,500 shares of its common stock under the May 2003 stock
repurchase program. The Company’s trading window closed on March 3, 2005. To
continue the repurchase program, the Company put into effect a 10b5-1 plan
which allows the Company to automatically repurchase a predetermined number
shares per day at the market price on every trading day until the trading window
re-opens on April 26, 2005. Since May 2003 when the program was approved by the
board of directors, we have repurchased 5.5 million shares totaling $155.8
million as of March 4, 2005.

Included in the
above noted common stock repurchase activity are 400,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock, repurchased on March 2, 2005, from one of its principal
stockholders, H.A. Schupf & Co., LLC, in a block transaction. The shares
were repurchased at a price of $44.20 per share for an aggregate total price of
$17,680,000, which reflected a discount from the current asking price as quoted
on the Nasdaq National Market at the time the transaction was entered into. See

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Management of Silicon Valley Bancshares is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Silicon Valley Bancshares’ internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed under the supervision of Silicon Valley Bancshares’ Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Silicon
Valley Bancshares’ financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As of December 31, 2004, management conducted an
assessment of the effectiveness of Silicon Valley Bancshares’ internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based
on this assessment, management has determined that Silicon Valley Bancshares’
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 is
effective.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Management’s assessment of
the effectiveness of Silicon Valley Bancshares’ internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
included herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal
control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this
Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
