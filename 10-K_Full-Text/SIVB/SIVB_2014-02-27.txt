Business Overview

For reporting purposes, SVB Financial Group has three operating segments for which we report financial information in this report: Global Commercial Bank, SVB Private Bank and SVB Capital.

Global Commercial Bank

Our Global Commercial Bank segment is comprised of results primarily from our Commercial Bank, and to a lesser extent, from SVB Specialty Lending, SVB Analytics and our Debt Fund Investments, each as further described below.

Commercial Bank

.  Our Commercial Bank products and services are provided by the Bank and its subsidiaries to commercial clients in the technology, venture capital/private equity, life science and cleantech industries. The Bank provides solutions to the financial needs of commercial clients through credit, global treasury management, foreign exchange, global trade finance, and other services. We broadly serve clients within the U.S., as well as non-U.S. clients in key international entrepreneurial markets.

Through our credit products and services, the Bank extends loans and other credit facilities to commercial clients. These loans may be secured by clients' assets or based on clients' cash flows. In some cases, loans may be unsecured. Credit products and services include traditional term loans, equipment loans, asset-based loans, revolving lines of credit, accounts-receivable-based lines of credit, capital call lines of credit and credit cards.

The Bank's global treasury management products and services include a wide range of deposit, receivables, payments and cash management solutions. Deposit products include business and analysis checking accounts, money market accounts, multi-currency, and sweep accounts. In connection with deposit services, the Bank provides receivables services, which include lockbox, electronic deposit capture, and merchant services that facilitate timely depositing of checks and other payments to clients' accounts. Payment and cash management products and services include wire transfer and automated clearing house payment services to enable clients to transfer funds quickly, as well as bill pay, account analysis,  and disbursement services. Client accounts and our services may be accessed through our online and mobile banking platforms.

The Bank's foreign exchange and global trade products and services facilitate clients' global finance and business needs. These products and services include foreign exchange services that allow commercial clients to manage their foreign currency needs and risks through the purchase and sale of currencies, swaps and hedges on the global inter-bank market. To facilitate clients' international trade, the Bank offers a variety of loan and credit facilities guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the



United States. The Bank also offers letters of credit, including export, import, and standby letters of credit, to enable clients to ship and receive goods globally.

The Bank and its subsidiaries offer a variety of investment services and solutions to its clients that enable them to effectively manage their assets. Through its registered investment advisory subsidiary, SVB Asset Management, the Bank offers discretionary investment advisory services based on its clients investment policies, strategies and objectives.  Through its broker-dealer subsidiary, SVB Securities, the Bank offers clients access to investments in third party money market mutual funds and fixed-income securities or through our repurchase agreement program.

SVB Specialty Lending

.  SVB Specialty Lending provides banking products and services to our premium wine industry clients, including vineyard development loans, as well as community development loans made as part of our responsibilities under the Community Reinvestment Act.

SVB Analytics

.  SVB Analytics provides equity valuation services to companies and venture capital/private equity firms.

Debt Fund Investments

.  Debt Fund Investments include our investments in debt funds in which we are a strategic investor: (i) Gold Hill funds, which provide secured debt to private companies of all stages, and (ii) Partners for Growth funds, which provide secured debt primarily to mid-stage and late-stage companies.

SVB Private Bank

SVB Private Bank is the private banking division of the Bank, which provides a range of personal financial solutions for consumers. Our clients are primarily venture capital/private equity professionals and executive leaders of the innovation companies they support. We offer a customized suite of private banking services, including mortgages, home equity lines of credit, restricted stock purchase loans, capital call lines of credit, and other secured and unsecured lending.  We also help our private banking clients meet their cash management needs by providing deposit account products and services, including checking, money market, certificates of deposit accounts, online banking, credit cards and other personalized banking services.  We also launched, in late 2013, a new subsidiary of the Bank, SVB Wealth Advisory, which provides private wealth management services to individual clients.

SVB Capital

SVB Capital is the venture capital investment arm of SVB Financial Group, which focuses primarily on funds management. SVB Capital manages approximately $1.9 billion of funds on behalf of third-party limited partner investors, and on a more limited basis, SVB

Financial Group. The SVB Capital family of funds is comprised of direct venture funds that invest in companies and funds of funds that invest in other venture capital funds. SVB Capital generates income for the Company primarily through investment returns (including carried interest) and management fees. Most of the funds managed by SVB Capital are consolidated into our financial statements. See Note 2-

Revenue Sources

Our total revenue is comprised of our net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and noninterest income for the year ended December

31, 2013 were

$699.1 million

and

$673.2 million

, respectively.

Net interest income is primarily income generated from interest rate differentials. The difference between the interest rates received on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to clients and securities held in our available-for-sale securities portfolio, and the interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, accounts for the major portion of our earnings. Our deposits are largely obtained from commercial clients within our technology, life science, venture capital and private equity industry sectors. Deposits are also obtained from the premium wine industry commercial clients and from our Private Bank clients. We do not obtain deposits from conventional retail sources.

Noninterest income is primarily income generated from our fee-based services and gains on our investments and derivative securities. We offer a wide range of fee-based financial services to our clients, including global commercial banking, private banking and other business services. Our ability to integrate and cross-sell our diverse financial services to our clients is a strength of our business model. Additionally, we hold available-for-sale, non-marketable and marketable investment securities.  Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, we manage and invest in venture capital/private equity funds that invest directly in privately-held companies, as well as funds that invest in other venture capital/private equity funds. Gains on these investments



are reported in our consolidated statements of income and include noncontrolling interest. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Noninterest Income-Gains on Investment Securities, Net” under Part II, Item 7 in this report. We also recognize gains from warrants to acquire stock in client companies, which we obtain in connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other services.

We derive substantially all of our revenue from U.S. clients.

We derived less than 10 percent of our total revenues from foreign clients for each of 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Industry Niches

In each of the industry niches we serve, we provide services to meet the needs of our clients throughout their life cycles, beginning with the emerging, start-up stage.

Technology and Life Sciences

We serve a variety of clients in the technology and life science industries. Our technology clients tend to be in the industries of hardware (semiconductors, communications and electronics), software, cleantech (energy and resource innovation) and related services. Because of the diverse nature of clean technology products and services, for our loan-related reporting purposes , cleantech-related loans are reported under our hardware, software, life science and other commercial loan categories, as applicable. Our life science clients primarily tend to be in the industries of biotechnology and medical devices. A key component of our technology and life science business strategy is to develop relationships with clients at an early stage and offer them banking services that will continue to meet their needs as they mature and expand. We serve these clients primarily through three practices:

•

Our

SVB Accelerator

practice focuses on serving our

“

emerging

”

or

“

early stage

”

clients. These clients are generally in the start-up or early stages of their life cycles. They are typically privately-held and funded by friends and family,

“

seed

”

or

“

angel

”

investors, or have gone through an initial round of venture capital financing. They are typically engaged in research and development, have little or no revenue and may have only brought a few products or services to market. SVB Accelerator clients tend to have annual revenues below $5 million, with many being pre-revenue companies.

•

Our

SVB Growth

practice serves our

“

mid-stage

”

and

“

late-stage

”

clients. These clients are in the intermediate or later stages of their life cycles and are generally privately-held, and many are dependent on venture capital for funding. Some of these clients are in the more advanced stages of their life cycles and may be publicly held or poised to become publicly held. Our SVB Growth clients generally have a solid or more established product or service offering in the market, with more meaningful or considerable revenue. They also may be expanding globally. SVB Growth clients tend to have annual revenues between $5 million and $75 million.

•

Our

SVB Corporate Finance

practice serves primarily our large corporate clients, which are more mature and established companies. These clients are generally publicly-held or large privately-held companies, have a more sophisticated product or service offering in the market, and significant revenue. They also may be expanding globally. SVB Corporate Finance clients tend to have annual revenues over $75 million.

Venture Capital/Private Equity

We provide financial services to clients in the venture capital/private equity community. Since our founding, we have cultivated strong relationships within the venture capital/private equity community, particularly with venture capital firms worldwide, many of which are also clients, facilitating deal flow to and from these firms.

Premium Wine

We are one of the leading providers of financial services to premium wine producers across the Western United States, primarily in California's Napa Valley, Sonoma County and Central Coast regions, and the Pacific Northwest. We focus on vineyards and wineries that produce grapes and premium wines.

Competition

The banking and financial services industry is highly competitive, and continues to evolve as a result of changes in regulation, technology, product delivery systems, and the general market and economic climate. Our current competitors include other banks, debt funds and specialty and diversified financial services intermediaries that offer lending, leasing, payments, investment, advisory and other financial products and services to our target client base. The principal competitive factors in our markets include product offerings, service, pricing, and transaction size and structure. Given our established market position within the



client segments that we serve, and our ability to integrate and cross-sell our diverse financial services to extend the length of our relationships with our clients, we believe we compete favorably in all our markets in these areas.

Employees

As of

December 31, 2013

, we employed

1,704

full-time equivalent employees.

Supervision and Regulation

Our bank and bank holding company operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies.  This regulation is intended primarily for the stability of the US banking system as well as the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (

“

DIF

”

). This regulation is not intended for the benefit of our security holders. As a bank holding company and a financial holding company, SVB Financial is subject to primary inspection, supervision, regulation, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (

“

BHC Act

”

).  The Bank, as a California state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to primary supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board, as well as the California Department of Business Oversight---Division of Financial Institutions (

“

DBO

”

). In addition, and to the extent provided by law, the Bank's deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (

“

FDIC

”

) and the DIF.  Our consumer banking activities are also subject to regulation by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (the

“

CFPB

”

). SVB Financial's other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and other applicable federal and state regulatory agencies, including the  SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (

“

FINRA

”

). In addition, we are subject to regulation by certain foreign regulatory agencies in international jurisdictions where we may conduct business, including the U.K., Israel, India, Hong Kong and China. (See

“

International Regulation

”

below.)

The following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion.  Regulators, Congress, state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules, laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors.  The nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on the Company's business cannot be predicted and in some cases, may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Regulation of Parent: SVB Financial

Under the BHC Act, SVB Financial, as a bank holding company, is subject to the Federal Reserve's regulation and its authority to, among other things:

•

Require periodic reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require in its discretion;

•

Require the maintenance of certain levels of capital;

•

Restrict the ability of bank holding companies to service debt or to receive dividends or other distributions from their subsidiary banks;

•

Require prior approval for senior executive officer and director changes under certain circumstances;

•

Require that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources as necessary to support each subsidiary bank. A bank holding company's failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of Federal Reserve regulations or both under current law, and will be a statutory violation under the Dodd-Frank Act, as described below;

•

Terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary;

•

Regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem our securities in certain situations; and

•

Approve acquisitions and mergers with banks and consider certain competitive, management, financial, financial stability and other factors in granting these approvals.  Similar California and other state banking agency approvals may also be required.

Bank holding companies are generally prohibited, except in certain statutorily prescribed instances including exceptions for financial holding companies, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or furnishing services to its subsidiaries. However, subject to prior notice or Federal Reserve Board approval, bank holding companies may engage in, or acquire shares of companies engaged in, activities determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper



incident thereto. As a financial holding company, SVB Financial may engage in these nonbanking activities and certain other broader securities, insurance, merchant banking and other activities that are determined to be

“

financial in nature

”

or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature without prior Federal Reserve approval, subject to the requirement imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act that SVB Financial will be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve approval in order to acquire a nonbanking company with more than $10

billion in consolidated assets.

Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (

“

GLBA

”

), in order to elect and retain financial holding company status, all depository institution subsidiaries of a bank holding company must be well capitalized, well managed, and, except in limited circumstances, in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (

“

CRA

”

). In addition, a financial holding company is also required to be well capitalized and well managed. Failure to sustain compliance with these requirements or correct any non-compliance within a fixed time could lead to divestiture of subsidiary banks or require all activities to conform to those permissible for a bank holding company.

Because we are a holding company, our rights and the rights of our creditors and security holders to participate in the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors, except to the extent we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. In addition, there are various statutory and regulatory limitations on the extent to which the Bank can finance or otherwise transfer funds to us or to our non-bank subsidiaries, including certain investment funds to which the Bank serves as an investment adviser, whether in the form of loans or other extensions of credit, including a purchase of assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, securities investments, the borrowing or lending of securities to the extent that the transaction causes the Bank or a subsidiary to have credit exposure to the affiliate, or certain other specified types of transactions, as discussed in further detail below. Furthermore, loans and other extensions of credit by the Bank to us or any of our non-bank subsidiaries are required to be secured by specified amounts of collateral and are required to be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

SVB Financial is also treated as a bank holding company under the California Financial Code. As such, SVB Financial and its subsidiaries are subject to periodic examination by and may be required to file reports with the DBO.

Securities Registration and Listing

SVB Financial's securities are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the

“

Exchange Act

”

), and listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As such, SVB Financial is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading, corporate governance, and other requirements and restrictions of the Exchange Act, as well as the Marketplace Rules and other requirements promulgated by the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.

As a public company, SVB Financial is also subject to the accounting oversight and corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including, among other things, required executive certification of financial presentations, increased requirements for board audit committees and their members, and enhanced requirements relating to  disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

The events of the past several years led to numerous new laws and regulatory pronouncements in the United States and internationally for financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (

“

Dodd-Frank Act

”

), enacted in 2010, is one of the most far reaching legislative actions affecting the financial services industry in decades and significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the United States.  The Dodd-Frank Act broadly affects the financial services industry by creating new resolution authorities, requiring ongoing stress testing of capital, mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements, increasing regulation of executive and incentive-based compensation and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector depending, in part, on the size of the financial institution. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for:

•

Capital standards applicable to bank holding companies may be no less stringent than those applied to insured depository institutions;

•

Annual stress tests for entities, including the Bank, and early remediation or so-called living wills are required for larger banks with more than $50 billion in assets, as well as risk committees of its board of directors that include a risk expert, and such requirements may have the effect of establishing new best practices standards for banks below $50 billion in assets, such as SVB Financial Group;

•

Restrictions on a bank's ability to sponsor or invest in certain funds, including hedge or private equity funds;

•

Repeal of the federal prohibition (Regulation Q) on the payment of interest on demand deposits, including business checking accounts, and made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance;

•

The establishment of the CFPB with responsibility for promulgating and enforcing regulations designed to protect consumers' financial interests and prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices by financial institutions;



•

The CFPB to directly examine those financial institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, such as SVBFG, for compliance with the regulations promulgated by the CFPB;

•

Limits, or places significant burdens and compliance and other costs, on activities traditionally conducted by banking organizations, such as originating and securitizing mortgage loans and other financial assets, arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions, proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds and restrictions on debit charge interchange fees; and

•

The establishment of new compensation restrictions and standards regarding the time, manner and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including documentation and governance, proxy access by stockholders, deferral and claw-back requirements.

Many of the regulations to implement the Dodd-Frank Act have not yet been published for comment or adopted in final form and/or will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on SVB Financial, our customers or the financial industry more generally.  Individually and collectively, both proposed and final regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial conditions and results of operations.

Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank

The Bank is a California state-chartered bank, a member and stockholder of the Federal Reserve and a member of the FDIC. The Bank is subject to primary supervision, periodic examination and regulation by the DBO and the Federal Reserve, as the Bank's primary federal regulator.  In general, under the California Financial Code, California banks have all the powers of a California corporation, subject to the general limitation of state bank powers under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to those permissible for national banks. Specific federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans. The regulatory structure also gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. If, as a result of an examination, the DBO or the Federal Reserve should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the Bank's operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, the DBO and the Federal Reserve, and separately FDIC as insurer of the Bank's deposits, have residual authority to:

•

Require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice;

•

Require prior approval for senior executive officer and director changes;

•

Direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of specific minimum capital ratios which may preclude the Bank from being deemed well capitalized for regulatory purposes;

•

Restrict the Bank's growth geographically, by products and services, or by mergers and acquisitions;

•

Enter into informal or formal enforcement orders, including memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders to take corrective action and enjoin unsafe and unsound practices;

•

Restrict or prohibit the Bank from paying dividends or making other distributions to SVB Financial;

•

Remove officers and directors and assess civil monetary penalties; and

•

Take possession of and close and liquidate the Bank.

California law permits state chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks. Therefore, the Bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so-called

“

closely related to banking

”

or

“

nonbanking

”

activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries, and further, the Bank may conduct certain

“

financial

”

activities in a subsidiary to the same extent as may a national bank, provided the Bank is and remains

“

well-capitalized,

”

“

well-managed

”

and in satisfactory compliance with the CRA.  The Bank continues to be in satisfactory compliance with the CRA.

Regulatory Capital

The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines governing risk-based capital and allowable leverage capital levels for bank holding companies and banks that are expected to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization's operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, such as loans, and those recorded as off-balance sheet items, such as commitments, letters of credit and recourse arrangements.

Under current capital guidelines, banking organizations are required to maintain certain minimum risk-based capital ratios, which are calculated by dividing a banking organization's qualifying capital by its risk-weighted assets (including both on- and off-balance sheet assets). Risk-weighted assets are calculated by assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories.  Qualifying capital is classified depending on the type of capital. For SVB Financial:



•

“

Tier 1 capital

”

consists of common equity, retained earnings, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued prior to May 19, 2010 and noncontrolling interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries (including trust-preferred securities), less goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Qualifying Tier 1 capital may consist of trust-preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, subject to certain criteria and quantitative limits for inclusion of restricted core capital elements in Tier 1 capital.

•

“

Tier 2 capital

”

includes, among other things, hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities, qualifying term subordinated debt, preferred stock that does not qualify as Tier 1 capital, and a limited amount of allowance for loan and lease losses.

As a bank holding company, SVB Financial is subject to three capital ratios: a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a Tier 1 leverage ratio. To be classified as

“

adequately capitalized

”

, the minimum required ratios for bank holding companies and banks are eight percent, four percent and four percent, respectively. Additionally, for SVB Financial to remain a financial holding company, the Bank must at all times be

“

well-capitalized,

”

which requires the Bank to have a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least ten percent, six percent and five percent, respectively. Moreover, maintaining SVB Financial at

“

well-capitalized

”

status provides certain benefits to SVB Financial, such as the ability to repurchase stock without prior regulatory approval (where otherwise regulatory approval would be required). To be

“

well-capitalized,

”

SVB Financial must at all times have a total risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least ten percent and six percent, respectively. There is no current Tier 1 leverage requirement for SVB Financial to be deemed

“

well-capitalized

”

.   As of December 31, 2013, both SVB Financial and the Bank were considered

“

well-capitalized

”

for regulatory purposes under existing capital guidelines.  New capital guidelines which will affect SVB Financial and the Bank in the future are discussed immediately below under the heading

“

New Capital Rules.

”

SVB Financial is also currently subject to rules that govern the regulatory capital treatment of equity investments in non-financial companies made on or after March 13, 2000 and held under certain specified legal authorities by a bank or bank holding company. Under the rules, these equity investments are subject to a separate capital charge that reduces SVB Financial's Tier 1 capital and, as a result, removes these assets from being taken into consideration in establishing  SVB Financial's required capital ratios discussed above.

Banking organizations must have appropriate capital planning processes, with proper oversight from the Board of Directors. Accordingly, pursuant to a separate supervisory letter from the Federal Reserve, bank holding companies are expected to conduct and document comprehensive capital adequacy analyses prior to the declaration of any dividends (on common stock, preferred stock, trust preferred securities or other Tier 1 capital instruments), capital redemptions or capital repurchases. Moreover, the federal banking agencies have adopted a joint agency policy statement, stating that the adequacy and effectiveness of a bank's interest rate risk management process and the level of its interest rate exposures are critical factors in the evaluation of the bank's capital adequacy. A bank with material weaknesses in its interest rate risk management process or high levels of interest rate exposure relative to its capital will be directed by the federal banking agencies to take corrective actions.

New Capital Rules

In July 2013, the FRB, FDIC and OCC published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations.  The agencies believe that the new rule will result in capital requirements that better reflect banking organizations’ risk profiles.  The rules implement the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. “Basel III” refers to various documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  The new rules become effective for SVB Financial and the Bank in January 2015, with some rules transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years.  The new capital rules, among other things, introduce a new capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”), increased minimum capital adequacy standards as measured by leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, changed the risk-weightings of certain on- and off-balance sheet assets for purposes of risk-based capital ratios, created an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios, and limit what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the various capital requirements.  In addition, the Bank will be required to demonstrate its ability to survive certain stress tests and remain well-capitalized.  Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion and state member banks with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion, such as SVB Financial Group and the Bank, are now generally required to undergo annual company-run stress tests, the results of which could require us to take certain actions, including raising additional capital.  We will be required to make summaries of the results of the company-run stress tests available to the public starting in June 2015.

Under the new capital rules, CET1 is defined as common stock, plus related surplus, and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less the majority of the regulatory deductions.  The new capital rules, like the current capital rules, specify that total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.  Tier 1 capital for SVB Financial and the Bank consists of common stock, plus related surplus and retained earnings.  Tier 2 capital for SVB Financial



and the Bank currently includes the entire amount of our allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”); however, the includable amount of ALLL could be limited in the future if the ALLL amount exceeds 1.25% of risk-weighted assets.

The new capital rules require a number of changes to regulatory capital deductions and adjustments, subject to a two-year transition period.  One such change relates to accumulated other comprehensive income.  Under current capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items included in shareholders’ equity are reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios.  Under the new capital rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including SVB Financial and the Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items.  Management is considering the merits of this opt-out provision  to reduce the impact of market volatility on its regulatory capital levels.

The new capital rules also include changes in the risk-weighting of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposure and requires higher tangible common equity components of capital.  These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status and a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%).

Under the new capital rules, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 will be as follows:

▪

4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets

▪

6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets

▪

8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets

▪

4% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”)

The new capital rules will require SVB Financial and the Bank to meet a capital conservation buffer requirement in order to avoid constraints on capital distributions, such as dividends and equity repurchases, and certain bonus compensation for executive officers.  To meet the requirement when it is fully phased in, the organization must maintain an amount of CET1 capital that exceeds the buffer level of 2.5% above each of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios.  The requirement will be phased in over a four year period, starting January 1, 2016, when the amount of such capital must exceed the buffer level of 0.625%.  The buffer level will increase by 0.625% each year until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.  When the capital conservation buffer requirement is fully phased in, to avoid constraints, a banking organization must maintain the following capital ratios: (1) CET1 to risk-weighted assets more than 7.0%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets more than 8.5%, and (iii) total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets more than 10.5%.

With respect to the Bank, the new capital rules also revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations effective January 1, 2015, by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the current 6%); and (iii) eliminating the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized.  The new capital rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any “prompt corrective action” category.    See “

Prompt Corrective Action and Other General Enforcement Authority

” below.

Although we continue to evaluate the impact that the new capital rules will have on SVB Financial and the Bank, we currently anticipate the Bank will remain well-capitalized under the new capital rules, and that SVB Financial and the Bank will meet the capital conservation buffer requirement.

Proprietary Trading and Certain Relationships with Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds

The

“

Volcker Rule

”

under the Dodd-Frank Act restricts, among other things, a bank's proprietary trading activities and a bank's ability to sponsor or invest in certain funds, including hedge or private equity funds. On December 10, 2013, the federal banking regulatory agencies adopted final rules Implementing the Volcker Rule.  The final rules will become effective on April 1, 2014, and include a schedule for affected entities to bring their activities and investments into conformance with the prohibitions and restrictions of the Volcker Rule.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Volcker Rule prohibits a banking entity from engaging in

“

proprietary trading,

”

which is defined as engaging as principal for the

“

trading account

”

of the banking entity in securities or other instruments.  Certain forms of proprietary trading may qualify as

“

permitted activities,

”

and thus not be subject to the ban on proprietary trading, such as trading in U.S. government or agency obligations, or certain other U.S. state or municipal obligations, and the obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. Based on this definition and the exceptions provided under the recently-issued regulations, we do not believe that we engage in any proprietary trading that would be prohibited under the Volcker Rule.



Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the rule prohibits a banking entity from sponsoring or investing in “covered funds,” which includes private equity or hedge funds.  One such exception permits a banking entity to sponsor and invest in a covered fund that it organizes on behalf of its customers, provided that additional requirements are met.  These investments, along with investments in covered funds that are not sponsored by the banking entity, are limited to three percent of each covered fund and in no case may the aggregate investments of a banking entity in all such funds comprise more than three percent of the institution's Tier 1 capital.

Under the final rules, the Volcker Rule prohibitions and restrictions will apply to SVB Financial, the Bank and any affiliate of SVB Financial or the Bank (including the SVB Capital funds).  SVB Financial maintains investments in certain venture capital and private equity funds that it did not organize; maintains investments in funds that exceed three percent of each such fund’s total commitments; and its aggregate investments in covered funds may exceed three percent of its Tier 1 capital.  SVB Financial (including its affiliates) expects, therefore, that it will be required to reduce the level of its investments in covered funds and to forego investment opportunities in certain funds in the future.  SVB Financial is generally required by the final rules to come into conformance with all these requirements by July 2015.  The time period to divest an investment that is not permitted by the final rule may be extended by the Federal Reserve Board, on a case-by-case basis, for up to two one-year extensions, and up to one additional five-year extension for investments that are considered illiquid.  We intend to seek the maximum extensions (up to July 2022) available to us.  However, there is no guaranty that the Federal Reserve Board will grant any of these extensions.

We currently estimate that our total venture capital and private equity fund investments deemed to be prohibited covered fund interests and therefore subject to the Volcker Rule restrictions, have, as of December 31, 2013, an aggregate carrying value of approximately $282 million (and an aggregate fair value of $348 million).  These covered fund interests are comprised of  interests attributable, solely, to the Company in our consolidated managed funds and certain of our non-marketable securities.

We continue to assess the financial impact of these rules on our fund investments, as well as the impact of other Volcker restrictions on other areas of our business.  (See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of Part I above.)

Prompt Corrective Action and Other General Enforcement Authority

State and federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action against an insured bank and its holding company. Federal laws require each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured banks.

Each federal banking agency has issued regulations defining five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. At each successive lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions, including restrictions on the bank's activities, operational practices or the ability to pay dividends. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment.

In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, bank holding companies and insured banks may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the agency or term of a written agreement with the agency. In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank; the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the termination of the bank's deposit insurance; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal agreements; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties; and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.

The FDIC may terminate a depository institution's deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution's financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of a bank's depositors. The termination of deposit insurance for a bank would also result in the revocation of the Bank's charter by the DBO.

Safety and Soundness Guidelines

Banking regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines establish operational and managerial standards generally relating to: (1) internal controls, information systems, and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest-rate exposure; (5) asset growth and asset quality; and (6) compensation, fees and benefits. In addition, the banking regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves.



Restrictions on Dividends

Dividends from the Bank constitute one of the primary sources of cash for SVB Financial. The Bank is subject to various federal and state statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends, including applicable provisions of the California Financial Code and the prompt corrective action regulations. In addition, the banking agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends, depending upon the Bank's financial condition, if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Furthermore, under the federal prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company's bank subsidiary is classified as

“

undercapitalized.

”

It is the Federal Reserve's policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization's expected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve's policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Additionally, in consideration of the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.

Transactions with Affiliates

Transactions between the Bank and its operating subsidiaries (such as SVB Securities and SVB Asset Management) on the one hand, and the Bank's affiliates (such as SVB Financial, SVB Analytics, or an entity affiliated with SVB Capital) on the other, are subject to restrictions imposed by federal and state law, designed to protect the Bank and its subsidiaries from engaging in unfavorable behavior with their affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act further extended the definition of an

“

affiliate

”

to include any investment fund to which the Bank or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser. More specifically, these restrictions, contained in the Federal Reserve's Regulation W, prevent SVB Financial and other affiliates from borrowing from, or entering into other credit transactions with, the Bank or its operating subsidiaries unless the loans or other credit transactions are secured by specified amounts of collateral. All loans and credit transactions and other

“

covered transactions

”

by the Bank and its operating subsidiaries with any one affiliate are limited, in the aggregate, to 10% of the Bank's capital and surplus; and all loans and credit transactions and other

“

covered transactions

”

by the Bank and its operating subsidiaries with all affiliates are limited, in the aggregate, to 20% of the Bank's capital and surplus. For this purpose, a

“

covered transaction

”

generally includes, among other things, a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, including a purchase of assets subject to an agreement to repurchase; a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate; the acceptance of a security issued by an affiliate as collateral for an extension of credit to any borrower; the borrowing or lending of securities where the Bank has credit exposure to the affiliate; the acceptance of

“

other debt obligations

”

of an affiliate as collateral for a loan to a third party; any derivative transaction that causes the Bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate; and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. After a transition period, the Dodd-Frank Act treats credit exposure from derivative transactions as a covered transaction.  It expands the transactions for which collateral is required to be maintained, and for all such transactions, it requires collateral to be maintained at all times.  In addition, the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act establishes certain restrictions and requirements (known as

“

Super 23A

”

and

“

Super 23B

”

) on transactions between a covered fund and a banking entity that serves as an investment manager, investment adviser, organizer and offeror, or sponsor with respect to that covered fund, regardless whether the banking entity has an ownership interest in the fund.

Loans to Insiders

Extensions of credit by the Bank to insiders of both the Bank and SVB Financial are subject to prohibitions and other restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve's Regulation O. For purposes of these limits,

“

insiders

”

include directors, executive officers and principal stockholders of the Bank or SVB Financial and their related interests. The term

“

related interest

”

means a company controlled by a director, executive officer or principal stockholder of the Bank or SVB Financial. The Bank may not extend credit to an insider of the Bank or SVB Financial unless the loan is made on substantially the same terms as, and subject to credit underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-insiders. Under federal banking regulations, the Bank may not extend credit to insiders in an amount, when aggregated with all other extensions of credit, is greater than $500,000 without prior approval from the Bank

’

s Board of Directors approval (with any interested person abstaining from participating directly or indirectly in the voting). California law, the federal regulations and the Dodd-Frank Act place additional restrictions on loans to insiders, and generally prohibit loans to executive officers other than for certain specified purposes. The Bank is required to maintain records regarding insiders and extensions of credit to them.

Premiums for Deposit Insurance

The FDIC insures our customer deposits through the DIF up to prescribed limits for each depositor. In recent years, due to higher levels of bank failures, the FDIC's resolution costs increased, which depleted the DIF.   In order to restore the DIF to its



statutorily mandated minimum of 1.35% of total deposits, the FDIC has increased deposit insurance premium rates. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020.  Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, such as the Bank, are responsible for funding the increase.  The Bank bases its assessment rate on a risk-based scorecard calculation provided by the FDIC.  In addition, the FDIC retains the authority to further increase the Bank

’

s assessment rates and the FDIC has established a higher reserve ratio of 2% as a long-term goal which goes beyond what is required by statute.  Continued increases in our FDIC insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on the Bank

’

s results of operations.  In 2013, we paid $12.8 million in assessments to the FDIC.

Other Regulations

The Bank is subject to many federal consumer protection statutes and regulations, such as the CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act,  the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, the National Flood Insurance Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act and various federal and state privacy protection laws.  In addition, the CFPB has the authority to conduct examinations for all depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion, which includes the Bank.  The CFPB

’

s mandate is to ensure that consumer financial practices at large banks, such as the Bank, confirm with consumer financial protection legal requirements.  The CFPB

’

s authority includes the ability to examine all subsidiaries and affiliates of the Bank as well.

Penalties for violating these laws could subject the Bank to lawsuits and could also result in administrative penalties, including, fines and reimbursements and orders to halt expansion/existing activities.  The CFPB has broad authority to institute various enforcement actions, including investigations, civil actions, cease and desist proceedings and the ability to refer criminal findings to the Department of Justice.  The Bank and SVB Financial are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair, corrupt or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition.

Regulations have also significantly expanded the anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act. Material deficiencies in anti-money laundering compliance can result in public enforcement actions by the banking agencies, including the imposition of civil money penalties and supervisory restrictions on growth and expansion. Such enforcement actions could also have serious reputation consequences for SVB Financial and the Bank.

In recent years, examination and enforcement by the state and federal banking agencies for non-compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations have increased and become more intense. The advent of the CFPB further heightens oversight and review of compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations. Due to these heightened regulatory concerns and new powers and authority of the CFPB, the Bank and its affiliates may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in their local community.

Regulation of Certain Subsidiaries

SVB Asset Management is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and is subject to its rules and regulations.  SVB Securities is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. SVB Securities is also a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. As a broker-dealer, it is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is designed to measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer. Under this rule, SVB Securities is required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet its continuing commitments to customers and others. Under certain circumstances, this rule could limit the ability of the Bank to withdraw capital from SVB Securities. In addition, following completion of

various studies on investment advisers and broker-dealers required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has, among other things, recommended to Congress that it consider various means to enhance the SEC's examination authority over investment advisers, which may have an impact on SVB Asset Management that we cannot currently assess.

International Regulation

Our international-based subsidiaries and global activities, including our banking branch in the United Kingdom, our joint venture bank in China and our non-bank financial company in India, are subject to the respective laws and regulations of those countries and the regions in which they operate. This includes laws and regulations promulgated by, but not limited to, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Reserve Bank of India.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our business faces significant risks, including credit, market/liquidity, operational, legal/regulatory and strategic/reputation risks. The factors described below may not be the only risks we face and are not intended to serve as a comprehensive listing or be applicable only to the category of risk under which they are disclosed. The risks described below are generally applicable to more than one of the following categories of risks. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following factors actually occurs, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Credit Risks

Because of the credit profile of our loan portfolio, our levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs can be volatile. We may need to make material provisions for loan losses in any period, which could reduce net income and/or increase net losses in that period.

Our loan portfolio has a credit profile different from that of most other banking companies. The credit profile of our clients varies across our loan portfolio, based on the nature of the lending we do for different market segments. In our portfolios for emerging, early-stage and mid-stage companies, many of our loans are made to companies with modest or negative cash flows and/or no established record of profitable operations. Repayment of these loans may be dependent upon receipt by borrowers of additional equity financing from venture capitalists or others, or in some cases, a successful sale to a third party, public offering or other form of liquidity event. Over the past years, overall economic conditions have improved, particularly since the financial crisis of 2008. Venture capital financing activity, as well as M&As and IPOs - activities on which venture capital firms rely to “exit” investments to realize returns --- have increased to healthier levels.  If current economic conditions weaken or do not continue to improve, such activities may slow down in a meaningful manner, which may impact the financial health of our client companies. In such case, venture capital firms may provide financing in a more selective manner, at lower levels, and/or on less favorable terms, any of which may have an adverse effect on our borrowers that are otherwise dependent on such financing to repay their loans to us. Moreover, collateral for many of our loans often includes intellectual property, which is difficult to value and may not be readily salable in the case of default. Because of the intense competition and rapid technological change that characterizes the companies in the technology and life science industry sectors, a borrower's financial position can deteriorate rapidly.

Some of our loans to our Corporate Finance and other larger clients may be made to companies with greater levels of debt relative to their equity. We have been continuing to increase our efforts to lend to larger corporate and private equity clients, as well as to underwrite larger loans. These larger loans include loans equal to or greater than $20 million to a single client, which has over time represented, and continues to represent, an increasingly larger proportion of our total loan portfolio. Additionally, in recent periods, we have increased our efforts to make sponsor-led buyout loans, which are leveraged buyout or recapitalization financings that are typically sponsored by our private equity clients. These buyout loans tend to be larger in size, many of which individually are greater than $20 million. Increasing our loan commitments, especially larger loans, could increase the impact on us of any single borrower default.

We may also enter into financing arrangements with our clients, the repayment of which may be dependent on third parties' financial condition or ability to meet their payment obligations.  For example, we enter into factoring arrangements which are secured by our clients' accounts receivable from third parties with whom they do business. Or, we make loans secured by letters of credit issued by other third party banks, or we enter into letters of credit discounting arrangements, the repayment of which may be dependent on the reimbursement by third party banks. These third parties may not meet their financial obligations to our clients or to us, which could have an adverse impact on us.

In our portfolio of venture capital and private equity firm clients, many of our clients have lines of credit, the repayment of which is dependent on the payment of capital calls or management fees by the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by these firms. In recent periods, we have increased our efforts to make these capital call lines of credit. These limited partner investors may face liquidity issues or have difficulties meeting their financial commitments, especially during unstable economic times, which may lead to our clients' inability to meet their repayment obligations to us.

We also lend primarily to venture capital/private equity professionals through our Private Bank. These individual clients may face difficulties meeting their financial commitments, especially during a challenging economic environment, and may be unable to repay their loans. We also lend to premium wineries and vineyards through our wine practice.  Repayment of loans made to these clients may be dependent on overall wine demand and sales, or other sources of financing or income (which may be adversely affected by a challenging economic environment), and overall grape supply (which may be adversely affected by poor weather, drought, or other natural conditions). In January 2014, Governor Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency for the state of California due to extreme low levels of rainfall.  Most of our clients’ wineries and vineyards are based in California.  The drought and any restrictions on water usage may have a material adverse affect on our borrowing clients and their ability to repay their loans.



See “Loans” under “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations --- Consolidated Financial Condition” under Item 7 of Part II of this report.

Based on the credit profile of our overall loan portfolio, our level of nonperforming loans, loan charge-offs and allowance for loan losses can be volatile and can vary materially from period to period. Increases in our level of nonperforming loans or loan charge-offs may require us to increase our provision for loan losses in any period, which could reduce our net income or cause net losses in that period. Additionally, such increases in our level of nonperforming loans or loan charge-offs may also have an adverse effect on our capital ratios, credit ratings and market perceptions of us.

Our allowance for loan losses is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors, and may not be adequate to absorb loan losses.

As a lender, we face the risk that our client borrowers will fail to pay their loans when due. If borrower defaults cause large aggregate losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We reserve for such losses by establishing an allowance for loan losses, the increase of which results in a charge to our earnings as a provision for loan losses. We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the forecasts and establishment of loan losses are also dependent on our subjective assessment based upon our experience and judgment. Actual losses are difficult to forecast, especially if such losses stem from factors beyond our historical experience or are otherwise inconsistent or out of pattern with regards to our credit quality assessments. There can be no assurance that our allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to absorb future loan losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The borrowing needs of our clients may be unpredictable, especially during a challenging economic environment. We may not be able to meet our unfunded credit commitments, or adequately reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.

A commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established under the agreement. The actual borrowing needs of our clients under these credit commitments have historically been lower than the contractual amount of the commitments. A significant portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. Because of the credit profile of our clients, we typically have a substantial amount of total unfunded credit commitments, which is reflected off our balance sheet. See Note 17 – “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments” of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional details. Actual borrowing needs of our clients may exceed our expected funding requirements, especially during a challenging economic environment when our client companies may be more dependent on our credit commitments due to the lack of available credit elsewhere, the increasing costs of credit, or the limited availability of financings from more discerning and selective venture capital/private equity firms. In addition, limited partner investors of our venture capital/private equity fund clients may fail to meet their underlying investment commitments due to liquidity or other financing issues, which may impact our clients' borrowing needs. Any failure to meet our unfunded credit commitments in accordance with the actual borrowing needs of our clients may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.

Additionally, we establish a reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments. The level of the reserve for unfunded credit commitments is determined by following a methodology similar to that used to establish our allowance for loan losses in our funded loan portfolio. The reserve is based on credit commitments outstanding, credit quality of the loan commitments, and management's estimates and judgment, and is susceptible to significant changes. There can be no assurance that our reserve for unfunded credit commitments will be adequate to provide for actual losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments. An increase in the reserve for unfunded credit commitments in any period may result in a charge to our earnings, which could reduce our net income or increase net losses in that period.

Market/Liquidity Risks

Our current level of interest rate spread may decline in the future. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread, or a sustained period of low market interest rates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

A major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on amounts used to fund assets and the interest rates and fees we receive on our interest-earning assets. We fund assets using deposits and other borrowings. While we offer interest-bearing deposit products, a majority of our deposit balances are from our noninterest bearing products. Our interest-earning assets include loans extended to our clients, securities held in our investment portfolio, and excess cash held to manage short-term liquidity. Overall, the interest rates we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities and receive on our interest-earning assets, and our level of interest rate spread, could be affected by a variety



of factors, including changes in market interest rates, competition, regulatory requirements, and a change over time in the mix of the types of loans, investment securities, deposits and other liabilities on our balance sheet.

Changes in key variable market interest rates, such as the Federal Funds, Prime, LIBOR or Treasury rates, generally impact our interest rate spread. While changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in the revenues earned from our interest-earning assets and the expenses associated with our interest-bearing liabilities, increases in market interest rates will nevertheless likely cause our interest rate spread to increase. Conversely, if interest rates decline, our interest rate spread will likely decline. Sustained low levels of market interest rates, as we have been experiencing, could continue to place downward pressure on our net income levels. Unexpected or further interest rate changes may adversely affect our business forecasts and expectations. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, such as inflation, recession, global economic disruptions, unemployment and the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies.

Any material reduction in our interest rate spread or the continuation of sustained low levels of market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.

Liquidity is essential to our business, both at the SVB Financial and the Bank level. We require sufficient liquidity to meet our expected financial obligations, as well as unexpected requirements stemming from client activity and market changes. Primary liquidity resources for SVB Financial include cash flow from investments and interest in financial assets held by operating subsidiaries other than the Bank; to the extent declared, dividends from the Bank, its main operating subsidiary; and as needed, periodic capital market transactions offering debt and equity instruments in the public and private markets. Client deposits are the primary source of liquidity for the Bank. When needed, wholesale borrowing capacity supplements our liquidity in the form of short- and long-term borrowings secured by our portfolio of high quality investment securities, long-term capital market debt issuances and, finally, through unsecured overnight funding channels available to us in the Fed Funds market. An inability to maintain or raise funds through these sources could have a substantial negative effect, individually or collectively, on SVB Financial and the Bank's liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms attractive to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include an increase in costs of capital in financial capital markets, a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us, or a decrease in depositor or investor confidence in us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe volatility or disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Any failure to manage our liquidity effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

Additionally, our credit ratings are important to our liquidity and our business. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, and limit our access to the capital markets. Moreover, a reduction in our credit ratings could increase the interest rates we pay on deposits, or adversely affect perceptions about our creditworthiness and business, or our overall reputation. Any damage to our reputation can also have an adverse affect on our liquidity and our business.

Equity warrant assets, venture capital and private equity funds and direct equity investment portfolio gains or losses depend upon the performance of the portfolio investments and the general condition of the public and private equity and M&A markets, which are uncertain and may vary materially by period.

In connection with negotiated credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock in private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science industries. We have also made investments through SVB Financial or our SVB Capital family of funds primarily in venture capital funds and direct investments in companies, many of which are required to be carried at fair value. The fair value of these warrants and investments are reflected in our financial statements and are adjusted on a quarterly basis. Fair value changes are generally recorded as unrealized gains or losses through consolidated net income. The timing and amount of changes in fair value, if any, of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying companies, fluctuations in the market prices of the preferred or common stock of the underlying companies, the timing of our receipt of relevant financial information, general volatility and interest rate market factors, and legal and contractual restrictions. The timing and amount of our realization of actual net proceeds, if any, from our disposition of these financial instruments depend upon various factors, some of which are beyond our control.  Those factors include the level of IPO and M&A activity (or other “exit” activity), legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell equity positions held (including the expiration of any “lock-up” agreements), the perceived and actual performance and future value of the underlying portfolio companies, the current valuation of the financial instruments, the timing of any actual dispositions, and overall market conditions. Because of the inherent variability of these financial instruments and the markets in which they are bought and sold, the fair market value of these financial instruments might increase or decrease materially, and the net proceeds realized upon disposition might be different than the then-current recorded fair market value.



We cannot predict future realized or unrealized gains or losses, and any such gains or losses are likely to vary materially from period to period. Additionally, the value of our equity warrant asset portfolio depends on, among other things, the underlying value of the issuing companies, which may also vary materially from period to period. See Note 12 – “Derivative Financial Instruments" of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional details.

Public equity offerings and mergers and acquisitions involving our clients or a slowdown in venture capital investment levels may reduce the borrowing needs of our clients, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

While an active market for public equity offerings and mergers and acquisitions generally has positive implications for our business, one negative consequence is that our clients may pay off or reduce their loans with us if they complete a public equity offering, are acquired by or merge with another entity or otherwise receive a significant equity investment. Moreover, our capital call lines of credit are typically utilized by our venture capital/private equity fund clients to make investments prior to receipt of capital called from their respective limited partners. A slowdown in overall venture capital investment levels may reduce the need for our clients to borrow from our capital call lines of credit. Any significant reduction in the outstanding amounts of our loans or under our lines of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Operational Risks

If we fail to retain our key employees or recruit new employees, our growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We rely on key personnel, including a substantial number of employees who have technical expertise in their subject matter area and/or a strong network of relationships with individuals and institutions in the markets we serve. In addition, as we expand in international markets, we will need to hire local personnel within those markets. If we were to have less success in recruiting and retaining these employees than our competitors, for reasons including domestic or foreign regulatory restrictions on compensation practices or the availability of more attractive opportunities elsewhere, our growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Moreover, equity awards are an important component of our compensation program, especially for our executive officers and other members of senior management. The extent of available equity for such awards is subject to stockholder approval. If we do not have sufficient shares to grant to existing or new employees, there could be an adverse effect on our recruiting and retention efforts, which could impact our growth and results of operations.

The occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. In recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents in recent periods. Moreover, in recent months, several large corporations, including retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, where in some cases, exposing sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity.  Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.

Information pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on the networks and systems of us, our clients and certain of our third party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our clients' confidence. Increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our



security, our inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our clients; our loss of business and/or clients; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business; our inability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability ---- any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

More generally, publicized information concerning security and cyber-related problems could inhibit the use or growth of electronic or web-based applications or solutions as a means of conducting commercial transactions.  Such publicity may also cause damage to our reputation as a financial institution. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We face risks associated with the ability of our information technology systems and our people and processes to support our operations and future growth effectively.

In order to serve our target clients effectively, we have developed, and are continually developing, a comprehensive array of banking and other products and services. In order to support these products and services and for the Company to operate effectively, we have developed, purchased and licensed information technology and other systems and processes. As our business continues to grow, we will continue to invest in and enhance these systems, and our people and processes. These investments and enhancements may affect our future profitability and overall effectiveness. From time to time, we may change, consolidate, replace, add or upgrade existing systems or processes, which if not implemented properly to allow for an effective transition, may have an adverse effect on our operations, including business interruptions which may result in inefficiencies, revenue losses, client losses, exposure to fraudulent activities, regulatory enforcement actions, or damage to our reputation. For example, we are in the process of enhancing our core banking system, as well as implementing and enhancing other systems to support specific business units, including our international operations. We also outsource certain operational and other functions to consultants or other third parties to enhance our overall efficiencies. If we do not implement our systems effectively or if our outsourcing business partners do not perform their functions properly, there could be an adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively maintain or improve our systems and processes, or utilize outsourced talent, to meet our business needs efficiently. Any failure of such could adversely affect our operations, financial condition, results of operations, future growth and reputation.

Business disruptions and interruptions due to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our operations can be subject to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control, such as earthquakes, fires, severe weather, public health issues, power failures, telecommunication loss, major accidents, terrorist attacks, acts of war, and other natural and man-made events. Our corporate headquarters and a portion of our critical business offices are located in California near major earthquake faults. Such events of disaster, whether natural or attributable to human beings, could cause severe destruction, disruption or interruption to our operations or property. Financial institutions, such as us, generally must resume operations promptly following any interruption. If we were to suffer a disruption or interruption and were not able to resume normal operations within a period consistent with industry standards, our business could suffer serious harm. In addition, depending on the nature and duration of the disruption or interruption, we might be vulnerable to fraud, additional expense or other losses, or to a loss of business and/or clients. We have implemented a business continuity management program and we continue to enhance it on an ongoing basis. There is no assurance that our business continuity management program can adequately mitigate the risks of such business disruptions and interruptions.

Additionally, natural disasters and external events could affect the business and operations of our clients, which could impair their ability to pay their loans or fees when due, impair the value of collateral securing their loans, cause our clients to reduce their deposits with us, or otherwise adversely affect their business dealings with us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



We face reputation and business risks due to our interactions with business partners, service providers and other third parties.

We rely on third parties, both in the United States and internationally in countries such as India, Hong Kong, China, Israel, and the United Kingdom, in a variety of ways, including to provide key components of our business infrastructure or to further our business objectives. These third parties may provide services to us and our clients or serve as partners in business activities. We rely on these third parties to fulfill their obligations to us, to accurately inform us of relevant information and to conduct their activities professionally and in a manner that reflects positively on us. Any failure of our business partners, service providers or other third parties to meet their commitments to us or to perform in accordance with our expectations could result in operational issues, increased expenditures, damage to our reputation or loss of clients, which could harm our business and operations, financial performance, strategic growth or reputation.

The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.

Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, payment processors, and other institutional clients, which may result in payment obligations to us or to our clients due to products arranged by us. Many of these transactions expose us to credit and market risk that may cause our counterparty or client to default. In addition, we are exposed to market risk when the collateral we hold cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the secured obligation. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.

In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, under our accounts receivable financing arrangements, we rely on information, such as invoices, contracts and other supporting documentation, provided by our clients and their account debtors to determine the amount of credit to extend. Similarly, in deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our customers' representations that their financial statements conform to U.S. GAAP (or other applicable accounting standards in foreign markets) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. We also may rely on customer representations and certifications, or other audit or accountants' reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of our clients. Our financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be negatively affected if we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.

Our accounting policies and methods are key to how we report our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain.

Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with U.S. GAAP and reflect management's judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.

If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. We may also face regulatory enforcement or other actions, including the potential delisting of our securities from Nasdaq Stock Market. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our stock price, and could potentially subject us to litigation.

We face risks associated with international operations.

One important component of our strategy is to expand internationally. In 2012, we opened a banking branch in the United Kingdom, as well as a joint venture bank in China.  We also have offices in Hong Kong, India and Israel.  We plan to expand our operations in some of our current international markets. We may also expand our business beyond those markets. Our efforts to expand our business internationally carry with them certain risks, including risks arising from the uncertainty regarding our



ability to generate revenues from foreign operations, risks associated with leveraging and doing business with local business partners and other general operational risks. In addition, there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international basis, including, among others, legal, regulatory and tax requirements and restrictions, uncertainties regarding liability, tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, incremental requirement of management's attention and resources, differing technology standards or customer requirements, cultural differences, political and economic risks, and financial risks, including currency and payment risks. These risks could adversely affect the success of our international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we face risks that our employees and affiliates may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing our international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act, anti-corruption laws, and other foreign laws and regulations.  Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could, among other things, result in enforcement actions and fines against us, as well as limitations on our conduct, any of  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Legal/Regulatory Risks

We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities, impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business, or result in higher costs to us.

SVB Financial Group, including the Bank, is extensively regulated under federal and state laws and regulations governing financial institutions, including those imposed by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the CFPB, and the DBO, as well as the international regulatory authorities that govern our global activities. Federal and state laws and regulations govern, restrict, limit or otherwise adversely affect the activities in which we may engage, may affect our ability to expand our business over time, may result in an increase in our compliance costs, including higher FDIC insurance premiums and may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers and employees. In addition, a change in the applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy could have a material adverse effect on our business, including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer or increasing the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products. These laws and regulations also require financial institutions, including SVB Financial and the Bank, to maintain certain minimum levels of capital and meet other minimum financial standards, which may require us to raise additional capital in the future, affect our ability to use our capital resources for other business purposes or affect our overall business strategies and plans.  Furthermore, the Bank for International Settlement's Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has adopted new capital, leverage and liquidity guidelines under the Basel Accord and the Federal Reserve Board has also finalized new capital requirements on banks and bank holding companies, all of which have the effect of raising our capital requirements beyond those previously required. Such rules also impose certain company-run stress testing requirements, which will be subject to disclosure in 2015, and could require us to raise additional capital or take certain other actions depending on the results of the stress tests. Increased regulatory requirements (and the associated compliance costs), whether due to the adoption of new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations, or more expansive or aggressive interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In particular, we are subject to the Volcker Rule which restricts or limits us from sponsoring or having ownership interests in

“

covered

”

funds including venture capital and private equity funds.  We must be in compliance with these rules by July 21, 2015, unless the compliance period is extended by the Federal Reserve Board, which may grant up to two one-year extensions and an additional extension of up to five years for certain investments deemed to be illiquid.  Under this rule, we will have to wind-down, transfer, divest or otherwise ensure the termination or expiration of any prohibited interests prior to July 2015, unless extended up to July 2022.  While we intend to seek the maximum extensions available to us, there is no assurance that we will be granted any of these extensions, and thus, we may be required to divest our prohibited interests within a short period of time.  We currently estimate that our total venture capital and private equity fund investments deemed to be prohibited covered fund interests have an aggregate carrying value of approximately $282 million as of December 31, 2013.  These covered fund interests are comprised of interests attributable, solely, to the Company in our consolidated managed funds and certain of our non-marketable securities.  These Volcker Rule restrictions could have a material adverse affect on our investment portfolio and results of operations.  The actual impact from these restrictions will be dependent on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain regulatory extensions, our ability to sell the investments, our carrying value at the time of any sale, the actual sales price realized, the timing of such sales, and any additional regulatory guidance or interpretations of the Volcker Rule.

See

“

Business - Supervision and Regulation

”

under Item

1 of Part I of this report.

We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.

The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil



money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we were to violate, or fail to comply with, international, federal or state laws or regulations governing financial institutions, we could be subject to disciplinary action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations

and reputation.

International, federal and state banking regulators possess broad powers to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to financial institutions. Other regulatory bodies, including the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market, FINRA, and state securities regulators, regulate investment advisers and  broker-dealers, including our subsidiaries, SVB Asset Management and SVB Securities, as applicable. If SVB Financial Group were to violate, even if unintentionally or inadvertently, the laws governing public companies, financial institutions and broker-dealers, the regulatory authorities could take various actions against us, depending on the severity of the violation, such as imposing restrictions on how we conduct our business, revoking necessary licenses or authorizations, imposing censures, civil money penalties or fines, issuing cease and desist or other supervisory orders, and suspending or expelling from the securities business a firm, its officers or employees. Supervisory actions could result in higher capital requirements, higher insurance premiums, higher levels of liquidity available to meet the Bank's financial needs and limitations on the activities of SVB Financial Group. These remedies and supervisory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.

Changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.

From time to time, the FASB or the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Also, our global initiatives, as well as continuing trends towards the convergence of international accounting standards, such as rules that may be adopted under the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), may result in our Company being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or outside auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in our revising or restating prior period financial statements.

SVB Financial relies on warrant income, investment distributions and dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its cash revenues.

SVB Financial is a holding company and is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives most of its cash revenues from three primary funding sources: warrant income, investment distributions, and dividends from its subsidiaries, primarily the Bank.  These sources generate income for SVB Financial to pay operating costs and

to the extent there are any

---- borrowings, dividends, and share repurchases.  Our equity warrant assets and investment interests are held by SVB Financial, and any income derived from those financial instruments are subject to a variety of factors as discussed in this

”

section.  Moreover, various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank and certain of our nonbank subsidiaries may pay to SVB Financial. Also, SVB Financial's right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.

Anti-takeover provisions and federal law, particular those applicable to financial institutions, may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could prevent a merger or acquisition that may be attractive to stockholders and/or have a material adverse affect on our stock price.

As a financial institution, we are subject to certain laws that could delay or prevent a third-party from acquiring us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders.  The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, together with federal and state regulations, require that, depending on the particular circumstances, either Federal Reserve approval must be obtained or notice must be furnished to the Federal Reserve and not disapproved prior to any person or entity acquiring “control” of a state member bank, such as the Bank.   In addition, DBO approval may be required in connection with the acquisition of control of the Bank.  Moreover, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and certain other actions we may take or have taken could delay or prevent a third-party from acquiring



us, even if beneficial to our stockholders.  These laws and provisions may prevent a merger or acquisition that would be attractive to stockholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.

Strategic/Reputation/Other Risks

Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses.

Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our business while there may exist a great deal of diversity within each industry, our clients are concentrated by these general industry niches: technology, life science, venture capital/private equity and premium wine. Our technology clients generally tend to be in the industries of hardware (semiconductors, communications and electronics), software and related services, and clean technology (energy and resource innovation).  Our life science clients are concentrated in the medical devices and biotechnology sectors.  Many of our client companies are concentrated by certain stages within their life cycles, such as early-stage, mid-stage or later-stage, and many of these companies are venture capital-backed. Our loan concentrations are derived from our borrowers engaging in similar activities or types of loans extended to a diverse group of borrowers that could cause those borrowers to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. In addition, we are continuing to increase our efforts to lend to larger clients and/or to make larger loans, which may increase our concentration risk.  Any adverse effect on any of our areas of concentration could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to our concentrations, we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors.

Decreases in the amount of equity capital available to our portfolio companies could adversely affect our business, growth and profitability.

Our core strategy is focused on providing banking products and services to companies, including in particular to emerging stage to mid-stage companies that receive financial support from sophisticated investors, including venture capital or private equity firms, “angels,” and corporate investors. We derive a meaningful share of our deposits from these companies and provide them with loans as well as other banking products and services. In some cases, our lending credit decision is based on our analysis of the likelihood that our venture capital or angel-backed client will receive additional rounds of equity capital from investors. If the amount of capital available to such companies decreases, it is likely that the number of new clients and investor financial support to our existing borrowers could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability and growth prospects.

Among the factors that have affected and could in the future affect the amount of capital available to our portfolio companies are the receptivity of the capital markets, the prevalence of IPO's or M&A activity of companies within our technology and life science industry sectors, the availability and return on alternative investments, economic conditions in the technology, life science and venture capital/private equity industries, and overall general economic conditions. Reduced capital markets valuations could reduce the amount of capital available to our client companies, including companies within our technology and life science industry sectors.

Because our business and strategy are largely based on this venture capital/private equity financing framework focused on our particular client niches, any material changes in the framework, including unfavorable economic conditions and adverse trends in investment or fund-raising levels, may have a material adverse effect on our business, strategy and overall profitability.

We face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and future growth.

We compete with other banks and specialty and diversified financial services companies and debt funds, some of which are larger than we are, which offer lending, leasing, payments, other financial products and advisory services to our client base. We also compete with non-financial services, particularly payment facilitators/processors or other nonbanking technology providers in the payments industry, which may offer specialized services to our client base. In addition, we compete with hedge funds and private equity funds. In some cases, our competitors focus their marketing on our industry sectors and seek to increase their lending and other financial relationships with technology companies or special industries such as wineries. In other cases, some competitors may offer a broader range of financial products to our clients, and some competitors may offer a specialized set of specific products or service. When new competitors seek to enter one of our markets, or when existing market participants seek to increase their market share, they sometimes undercut the pricing and/or credit terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our market share or ability to exploit new market opportunities. Our pricing and credit terms could deteriorate if we act to meet these competitive challenges, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and future growth. Similarly, competitive pressures could adversely affect the business, results of operations, financial condition and future growth of our non-banking services, including our payments services, as well as our access to capital and attractive investment opportunities for our funds business.



Our ability to maintain or increase our market share depends on our ability to attract and maintain, as well as meet the needs of, existing and future clients.

Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain or increase our market share.  In particular, much of our success depends on our ability to attract early-stage or start-up companies and to retain those companies as they grow and mature successfully through the various stages of their life cycles.   In order to maintain or increase our market share, we must be able meet the needs of existing and potential future clients.  Not only must we adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards, we must also endeavor to innovate new products and services beyond industry standards in order to serve our clients, who are innovators themselves.  A failure to achieve market acceptance for any new products or service we introduce, a failure to introduce products or services that the market may demand, or the costs associated with developing, introducing and providing new products and services could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, growth prospects and financial condition.

We face risks in connection with our strategic undertakings and new business initiatives.

We are engaged, and may in the future engage, in strategic activities domestically or internationally, including acquisitions, joint ventures, partnerships, investments or other business growth initiatives or undertakings. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities, that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities, if undertaken, will be successful.

We are focused on our long-term growth and have undertaken various strategic activities and business initiatives, many of which involve activities that are new to us, or in some cases, experimental in nature.  For example, we are expanding our global presence and may engage in activities in jurisdictions where we have limited experience.  We are also expanding our payments capabilities to better serve our clients, including innovating new electronic payment processing solutions,  developing new payments technologies, and exploring new evolving payments systems, such as virtual currencies known as

“

bitcoin.

”

Our ability to execute strategic activities and new business initiatives successfully will depend on a variety of factors. These factors likely will vary based on the nature of the activity but may include our success in integrating an acquired company or a new growth initiative into our business, operations, services, products, personnel and systems, operating effectively with any partner with whom we elect to do business, meeting applicable regulatory requirements, hiring or retaining key employees, achieving anticipated synergies, meeting management's expectations, actually realizing the anticipated benefits of the activities, and overall general market conditions. Our ability to address these matters successfully cannot be assured. In addition, our strategic efforts may divert resources or management's attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and/or potential liability. If we do not successfully execute a strategic undertaking, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and growth prospects. In addition, if we were to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired, that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us, which would adversely affect our results of operations.

In addition, in order to finance future strategic undertakings, we might obtain additional equity or debt financing. Such financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If obtained, equity financing could be dilutive and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business reputation is important and any damage to it could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our reputation is very important to sustain our business, as we rely on our relationships with our current, former and potential clients and stockholders, the venture capital and private equity communities, and the industries that we serve. Any damage to our reputation, whether arising from regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and exchange listing requirements, negative publicity, our conduct of our business or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our risk management framework may not be effective in identifying, managing or mitigating risks and/or losses to us.

We have implemented a risk management framework to identify and manage our risk exposure.  This framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, operational, financial, interest rate, legal and regulatory, compliance, strategic, reputation, fiduciary, global, sovereign, and general economic risks.  Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies, which involves management assumptions and judgment.  In addition, under this framework, we are currently developing a risk appetite statement to detail our risk tolerance levels at an enterprise-wide level.  There is no assurance that our risk management framework will be effective under all circumstances or that it will adequately identify, manage or mitigate any risk or loss to us.  If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected.  We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.



The price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline.

The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:

•

actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;

•

changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts;

•

failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;

•

speculation in the press or investment community;

•

strategic actions by us or our competitors;

•

actions by institutional stockholders;

•

fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;

•

general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;

•

proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;

•

anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us; or

•

domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.

The trading price of the shares of our common stock and the value of our other securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including, without limitation, our financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects, and future sales of our equity or equity-related securities. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength. A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Market Information

Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol SIVB. The per share range of high and low sale prices for our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, for each full quarterly period during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, was as follows:

As of

December 31, 2013

, SVB Financial had no preferred stock outstanding.

Holders

As of February 4, 2014, there were


registered holders of our stock, and we believe there were approximately

21,504

beneficial holders of common stock whose shares were held in the name of brokerage firms or other financial institutions. We are not provided with the number or identities of all of these stockholders, but we have estimated the number of such stockholders from the number of stockholder documents requested by these brokerage firms for distribution to their customers.

Dividends and Stock Repurchases

SVB Financial does not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock. We have not paid any cash dividends since 1992.  Our Board of Directors periodically evaluates whether to pay cash dividends, taking into consideration such factors as it considers relevant, including our current and projected financial performance, our projected sources and uses of capital, general economic conditions, considerations relating to our current and potential stockholder base, changing regulatory rules, particularly rules impacting capital requirements, and relevant tax laws. Our ability to pay cash dividends is also limited by generally applicable corporate and banking laws and regulations. See “Business-Supervision and Regulation-Restrictions on Dividends” under Part I, Item 1 of this report. SVB Financial did not repurchase any of its common stock during


.

Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans

The information required by this Item regarding equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference to the information set forth in Part III, Item 12 of this report.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds

As previously disclosed in our 2013 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, during the first quarter of 2013, we discovered that we sold shares of our common stock that were not registered with the SEC to certain participants, through their investment in our unitized common stock fund, under our SVB Financial Group 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“401(k) Plan”). The common stock fund is comprised primarily of shares of our common stock, and to a lesser extent, cash; and participants may invest 401(k) Plan contributions for an interest in the fund. With respect to the purchases that were not registered, the shares of our common stock held in the common stock fund are purchased by our 401(k) Plan trustee from the open market; hence, these purchases do not represent any additional equity dilution of our outstanding shares. We do not receive any proceeds from these transactions.

Under applicable federal securities laws, certain participants may have a right to rescind, and to require us to repurchase, their purchases of our common stock (through their investment in the common stock fund) for an amount equal to the price paid for the securities, plus interest. Generally, the federal statute of limitations applicable to such rescission rights is one year. Additionally, we may be subject to potential civil and other penalties by regulatory authorities as a result of this registration issue.



Based on our estimates, we do not believe the amount of potential liability associated with the securities subject to rescission rights is material to our financial condition or results of operations. As of December 31, 2013, we estimate that there were less than 40,000 shares of our common stock (over the one-year period preceding such date) that would be subject to rescission rights; substantially none of which, based on our closing stock price of $124.65 as of February 26, 2014 would be economically advantageous for participants to exercise any such rescission rights. These securities continue to be reflected in stockholders' equity in our balance sheet.

We filed a new registration statement on Form S-8 on May 20, 2013 to register future sales of our common stock through our common stock fund under the 401(k) Plan.

Management’s Overview of


Financial Performance

Overall, we had another strong year in


, which reflected the strength of our clients and our business. We had record net income available to common stockholders of

$215.9 million

, with a diluted EPS of

$4.70

in 2013, compared to

$3.91

in 2012. In


, compared to


, we experienced strong growth in net interest income as a result of outstanding loan growth with a record high average balance of $9.4 billion.  We also experienced strong growth in noninterest income as a result of exceptional gains on investment securities, net, and equity warrant assets. Included in our results for the year were pre-tax gains of $55.0 million from the increased valuation of two of our portfolio companies, FireEye, Inc. ("FireEye") and Twitter, Inc. ("Twitter"), which included gains from equity warrant assets and gains from non-marketable and other securities, net of noncontrolling interests. Our total client funds, which consist of on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance sheet client investment funds, also increased, reflecting growth from our existing clients and new clients. In addition, overall credit quality remained strong, we saw continued growth in fee income and our liquidity and capital ratios continued to remain strong.


results (compared to


, where applicable) reflected strong performance across all areas of our businesses and included:

▪

Average loan balances of

$9.4 billion

, an increase of

$1.8 billion

, or

23.7

percent. Period-end loan balances were

$10.9 billion

, an increase of

$2.0 billion

, or

21.9

percent.

▪

Average deposit balances of

$19.6 billion

, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 9.5 percent. Period-end deposit balances were

$22.5 billion

, an increase of

$3.3 billion

,

17.2

percent.

▪

Average total client funds (including both on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance sheet client investment funds) were $43.8 billion, an increase of $5.7 billion, or 15.0 percent. Period-end total client funds were

$48.8 billion

, an increase of

$7.1 billion

, or

17.1

percent.

▪

Net interest income (fully taxable equivalent basis) of

$699.1 million

, an increase of

$79.3 million

, primarily due to an increase in interest income from loans attributable to growth in average balances of

$1.8 billion

. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the overall yield of our loan portfolio from a shift in the mix of our late stage and sponsor-led buyout portfolios from national Prime rate, to LIBOR, indexed loans, in addition to, lower rates on existing and new capital call lines, as a result of increased competition.

▪

Our net interest margin increased to

3.29

percent, compared to

3.19

percent, primarily due to growth in average loan balances (higher-yielding assets), partially offset by lower loan yields from a continued shift in the mix of our loans as noted previously.

▪

A provision for loan losses of

$63.7 million

, compared to

$44.3 million

. The provision of

$63.7 million

in 2013 was primarily driven by net charge-offs of $31.5 million and period-end loan growth of

$2.0 billion

resulting in a provision



of $21.9 million. Net charge-offs in 2013 were 0.33 percent of average total gross loans, reflecting the strong overall credit quality of our portfolio.

▪

Non-GAAP core fee income (deposit service charges, letters of credit fees, credit card fees, lending related fees, client investment fees, and foreign exchange fees) of $

175.5 million

, an increase of $

17.1 million

, or

10.8

percent. This increase reflects increased client activity and continued growth in our business, primarily from credit card fees, foreign exchange fees and lending related fees. See “Results of Operations—Noninterest Income” for a description and reconciliation of non-GAAP core fee income.

▪

Non-GAAP net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests and excluding gains on sales of certain-available-for-sale securities of

$77.3 million

compared to

$31.5 million

. The increase was primarily related to strong IPO and M&A activity with primary contributions from FireEye and Twitter. See “Results of Operations—Noninterest Income—Gains on Investment Securities, Net” for further details and a reconciliation of non-GAAP net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests.

▪

Gains of $46.1 million from equity warrant assets, an increase of $26.7 million, or 137.8 percent.  The increase was primarily driven by healthy IPO and M&A activity, including the FireEye and Twitter IPOs.

▪

Noninterest expense of

$621.7 million

, an increase of

$75.7 million

, or

13.9

percent. The increase was primarily due to increases in incentive compensation and other employee benefits as a result of the strong performance in 2013 relative to our internal performance targets.

▪

Overall, our liquidity remained strong based on the attributes of our period-end available-for-sale securities portfolio, which totaled

$12.0 billion

at December 31, 2013, compared to

$11.3 billion

at December 31, 2012. Our available-for-sale securities portfolio continued to be a good source of liquidity as it was invested in high quality investments and generated steady monthly cash flows. Additionally, our available-for-sale securities portfolio continued to provide us with the ability to secure wholesale borrowings, as needed.

Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Common Share

We use and report non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per common share, which excludes, in the year applicable, gains from sales of certain available-for-sale securities as well as gains from the sale of certain assets related to our equity management services business. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that do not occur every reporting period. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results and related trends, and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income available to common stockholders and non-GAAP diluted earnings per common share for


and


is as follows:

(1)

Gains on the sales of $316 million in certain available-for-sale securities in the second quarter of 2012.

(2)

Net gains of $4.2 million from the sale of certain assets related to our equity management services business in the second quarter of 2012.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. We have identified four policies as being critical because they require us to make particularly difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and we base these estimates on historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Our critical accounting policies include those that address the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded credit commitments, measurements of fair value, the valuation of equity warrant assets and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. Our senior management has discussed and reviewed the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.



Allowance for Loan Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Credit Commitments

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. We consider our accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses to be critical as estimation of the allowance involves material estimates by us and is particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term. Determining the allowance for loan losses requires us to make forecasts that are highly uncertain and require a high degree of judgment. Our loan loss reserve methodology is applied to our loan portfolio and we maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels that we believe are appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio.

Our allowance for loan losses is established for loan losses that are probable but not yet realized. The process of anticipating loan losses is inherently imprecise. We apply a systematic process for the evaluation of individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses. On a quarterly basis, each loan in our portfolio is assigned a credit risk rating through an evaluation process, which includes consideration of such factors as payment status, the financial condition of the borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral values, potential loan concentrations, and general economic conditions.

The allowance for loan losses is based on a formula allocation for similarly risk-rated loans by client industry sector and individually for impaired loans. Our formula allocation is determined on a quarterly basis by utilizing a historical loan loss migration model, which is a statistical model used to estimate an appropriate allowance for outstanding loan balances by calculating the likelihood of a loan being charged-off based on its credit risk rating using historical loan performance data from our portfolio.   The formula allocation provides the average loan loss experience for each portfolio segment, which considers our quarterly historical loss experience since the year 2000, both by risk-rating category and client industry sector. The resulting loan loss factors for each risk-rating category and client industry sector are ultimately applied to the respective period-end client loan balances for each corresponding risk-rating category by client industry sector to provide an estimation of the allowance for loan losses.

We apply qualitative allocations to the results we obtained through our historical loan loss migration model to ascertain the total allowance for loan losses. These qualitative allocations are based upon management's assessment of the risks that may lead to a loan loss experience different from our historical loan loss experience. These risks are aggregated to become our qualitative allocation. Based on management's prediction or estimate of changing risks in the lending environment, the qualitative allocation may vary significantly from period to period and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of the following factors:

•

Changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collections, and charge-off and recovery practices;

•

Changes in national and local economic business conditions, including the market and economic condition of our clients' industry sectors;

•

Changes in the nature of our loan portfolio;

•

Changes in experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff;

•

Changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans;

•

Changes in the trend of the volume of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, and other loan modifications;

•

Reserve floor for portfolio segments that would not draw a minimum reserve based on the lack of historical loan loss experience;

•

Reserve for large funded loan exposure; and

•

Other factors as determined by management from time to time.

A committee comprised of senior management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.

Reserve for Unfunded Credit Commitments

The level of the reserve for unfunded credit commitments is determined following a methodology that parallels that used for the allowance for loan losses. We consider our accounting policy for the reserve for unfunded credit commitments to be critical as estimation of the reserve involves material estimates by our management and is particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term. We record a liability for probable and estimable losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments. Each quarter, every unfunded client credit commitment is allocated to a credit risk-rating category in accordance with each client's credit risk rating. We use the historical loan loss factors described under our allowance for loan losses to calculate the possible loan loss experience if unfunded credit commitments are funded. Separately, we use historical trends to calculate the probability of an unfunded credit commitment being funded. We apply the loan funding probability factor to risk-



factor adjusted unfunded credit commitments by credit risk-rating to derive the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. The reserve for unfunded credit commitments also includes certain qualitative allocations as deemed appropriate by management.

Fair Value Measurements

We use fair value measurements to record fair value for certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Our available-for-sale securities, derivative instruments, marketable securities and certain non-marketable and other securities are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We disclose our method and approach for fair value measurements of assets and liabilities in Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 in this report.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,

establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable and the significance of the level of the input to the entire measurement. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. The three levels for measuring fair value are defined in Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 in this report.

It is our practice to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. When available, we use quoted market prices to measure fair value. If market prices are not available, fair value measurement is based upon valuation techniques that use relevant inputs derived from primarily market-based or independently-sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment speeds, option volatilities and currency rates. Substantially all of our financial instruments use the foregoing methodologies, collectively Level 1 and Level 2 measurements, to determine fair value adjustments recorded to our financial statements. However, in certain cases, when market observable inputs for valuation techniques may not be readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument, and the significance of those inputs in the entire measurement.

The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. For inactive markets, there is little information, if any, to evaluate if individual transactions are orderly. Accordingly, we are required to estimate, based upon all available facts and circumstances, the degree to which orderly transactions are occurring and provide more weighting to price quotes that are based upon orderly transactions.  In addition, changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greater for financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3. Our valuation processes include a number of key controls that are designed to ensure that fair value is measured appropriately.

The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of

December 31, 2013

and


:



As of

December 31, 2013

, our available-for-sale securities portfolio, consisting primarily of mortgage-backed securities and debentures issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, represented

$12.0 billion

, or

89.9 percent

of our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, compared to

$11.3 billion

, or

92.6 percent

, as of

December 31, 2012

. These instruments were classified as Level 2 because their valuations were based on indicative prices corroborated by observable market quotes or valuation techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio is sensitive to changes in levels of market interest rates and market perceptions of credit quality of the underlying securities. Market valuations and impairment analyses on assets in the available-for-sale securities portfolio are reviewed and monitored on a quarterly basis. Assets valued using Level 2 measurements also include certain equity warrant assets in shares of public company capital stock, marketable securities, interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward and option contracts, loan conversion options and client interest rate derivatives.

To the extent available-for-sale securities are used to secure borrowings, changes in the fair value of those securities could have an impact on the total amount of secured financing available. We pledge securities to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. The market value of collateral pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (comprised primarily of U.S. agency debentures) at

December 31, 2013

totaled

$1.4 billion

, all of which was unused and available to support additional borrowings. The market value of collateral pledged at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with our liquidity risk management practices at

December 31, 2013

totaled

$578 million

, all of which was unused and available to support additional borrowings. We have repurchase agreements in place with multiple securities dealers, which allow us to access short-term borrowings by using available-for-sale securities as collateral. At

December 31, 2013

, we had not utilized any of our repurchase lines to secure borrowed funds.

Financial assets valued using Level 3 measurements consist of our investments in venture capital and private equity funds and direct equity investments in privately-held companies, equity warrant assets in shares of private company capital stock and equity warrant assets and other investment securities in shares of public company stock subject to certain sales restrictions for which the sales restriction has not been lifted.

During


, the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of

$420.3 million

(which is inclusive of noncontrolling interest), primarily due to valuation increases in underlying investments in our managed funds, as well as gains from liquidity events and distributions. Additionally, we had strong net gains in 2013 from our equity warrant assets. During


and


, the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of

$104.7 million

and

$176.9 million

(which is inclusive of noncontrolling interest), respectively.

Non-Marketable and Other Securities

Our non-marketable and other securities carried under fair value accounting consist of direct equity investments in privately-held companies, investments in venture capital and private equity funds, and direct equity investments in public companies. Our managed funds that hold these investments qualify as investment companies under the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies, and accordingly, these funds report their investments at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as investment gains or losses in our consolidated statements of income. The estimated fair value of these securities is based primarily on financial information obtained as the general partner of the fund or obtained from the funds' respective general partner.

For direct private company investments, valuations are based upon consideration of a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, exit strategies, and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. These valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of management judgment.

The valuation of our venture capital and private equity funds is primarily based upon our pro-rata share of the fair market value of the net assets of a fund as determined by such fund on the valuation date. We utilize the most recent available financial information from the investee general partner. We account for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment's net asset value by using the most recent available financial information available from the investee general partner, for example, September 30

th

for our December 31

st

consolidated financial statements, adjusted for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and known significant fund transactions or market events about which we are aware through information provided by the fund managers or from publicly available transaction data during the reporting period.

The valuation of direct equity investments in public companies are based on quoted market prices less a discount if the securities are subject to certain sales restrictions. Sales restriction discounts generally range from 10% to 20% depending on the duration of the sale restrictions which typically range from 3 to 6 months.

The valuation of non-marketable securities in shares of private company capital stock and the valuation of other securities in shares of public company stock with certain sales restrictions is subject to significant judgment. The inherent uncertainty in the process of valuing securities for which a ready market does not exist may cause our estimated values of these securities to



differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences could be material. The timing and amount of changes in fair value, if any, of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying companies, fluctuations in the market prices of the preferred or common stock of the underlying companies, general volatility and interest rate market factors, and legal and contractual restrictions. The timing and amount of actual net proceeds, if any, from the disposition of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including investor demand for IPOs, levels of M&A activity, legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell, and the perceived and actual performance of portfolio companies. All of these factors are difficult to predict and there can be no assurances that we will realize the full value of these securities, which could result in significant losses. (See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of Part I above.)

Derivative Assets-Equity Warrant Assets

In connection with negotiated credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock in primarily private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science industries. Equity warrant assets for shares of private and public companies are recorded at fair value on the grant date and adjusted to fair value on a quarterly basis through consolidated net income.

We account for equity warrant assets with net settlement terms in certain private and public client companies as derivatives. In general, equity warrant assets entitle us to buy a specific number of shares of stock at a specific price within a specific time period. Certain equity warrant assets contain contingent provisions, which adjust the underlying number of shares or purchase price upon the occurrence of certain future events. Our warrant agreements typically contain net share settlement provisions, which permit us to receive at exercise a share count equal to the intrinsic value of the warrant divided by the share price (otherwise known as a “cashless” exercise).

The fair value of our equity warrant assets portfolio is reviewed quarterly. We value our equity warrant assets using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model, which incorporates the following significant inputs:

•

An underlying asset value, which is estimated based on current information available, including any information regarding subsequent rounds of funding for the entity issuing the warrant.

•

Stated strike price, which can be adjusted for certain warrants upon the occurrence of subsequent funding rounds or other future events.

•

Price volatility or the amount of uncertainty or risk about the magnitude of the changes in the underlying asset price. The volatility assumption is based on historical price volatility of publicly traded companies within indices similar in nature to the underlying client companies issuing the warrant. The actual volatility input is based on the median volatility for an individual public company within an index, averaged for the past 16 quarters. The weighted average quarterly median volatility assumption used for the warrant valuation at

December 31, 2013

was

40.1 percent

, compared to

45.2 percent

at

December 31, 2012

.

•

Actual data on cancellations and exercises of our equity warrant assets are utilized as the basis for determining the expected remaining life of the equity warrant assets in each financial reporting period. Equity warrant assets may be exercised in the event of acquisitions, mergers or IPOs, and cancelled due to events such as bankruptcies, restructuring activities or additional financings. These events cause the expected remaining life assumption to be shorter than the contractual term of the warrants. The remaining life assumption used for the valuation of our private warrant portfolio was

45.0 percent

at December 31, 2013 and 2012.

•

The risk-free interest rate is derived from the Treasury yield curve and is calculated based on a weighted average of the risk-free interest rates that correspond closest to the expected remaining life of the warrant. The weighted average risk-free interest rate used for the equity warrant assets portfolio valuation was

0.8 percent

at

December 31, 2013

and

0.4

percent at

December 31, 2012

.

•

A discount applied to all private company warrants to account for a general lack of marketability due to the private nature of the associated underlying company. The discount is based on long-run averages and is influenced over time by various factors, including market conditions. The marketability discount used for the valuation of our private warrant portfolio was

22.5 percent

at December 31, 2013 and 2012.

•

A discount applied to all public company warrants subject to certain sales restrictions. As the sales restriction term nears, and other sale restrictions are lifted, discounts are adjusted downward to 0 percent once all restrictions expire or are removed.  The weighted average sales restrictions discount used for the valuation of our public warrant portfolio was

13.7

percent at December 31, 2013.  There were no sales restriction discounts applied to our public warrant portfolio at December 31, 2012.



The fair value of our equity warrant assets recorded on our balance sheets represents our best estimate of the fair value of these instruments. Changes in the above inputs may result in significantly different valuations.

The timing and value realized from the disposition of equity warrant assets depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying portfolio companies, investor demand for IPOs, fluctuations in the price of the underlying common stock of these private and public companies, levels of M&A activity, and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities. All of these factors are difficult to predict. Many equity warrant assets may be terminated or may expire without compensation and may incur valuation losses from lower-priced funding rounds. We are unable to predict future gains or losses with accuracy, and gains or losses could vary materially from period to period.

We consider our accounting policy for equity warrant assets to be critical as the valuation of these assets is complex and subject to a certain degree of management judgment. Management has the ability to select from several valuation techniques and has alternative approaches in the calculation of significant inputs. The selection of alternative valuation techniques or alternative approaches used to calculate significant inputs in the current methodology may cause our estimated values of these assets to differ significantly from the values recorded. Additionally, the inherent uncertainty in the process of valuing these assets for which a ready market is unavailable may cause our estimated values of these assets to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the assets existed, and those differences could be material. Further, the fair value of equity warrant assets may never be realized, which could result in significant losses.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax-basis carrying amount. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided when management assesses available evidence and exercises their judgment that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

We consider our accounting policy relating to income taxes to be critical as the determination of current and deferred income taxes is based on complex analyses of many factors including interpretation of federal, state and foreign income tax laws, the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities (temporary differences), estimates of amounts due or owed, the timing of reversals of temporary differences and current financial accounting standards. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates due to tax law interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities. Additionally, there can be no assurances that estimates and interpretations used in determining income tax liabilities may not be challenged by federal and state taxing authorities.

In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740,

Income Taxes.

We believe that our unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, are adequate in relation to the potential for additional tax assessments.

We are also subject to routine corporate tax audits by the various tax jurisdictions. In the preparation of income tax returns, tax positions are taken based on interpretation of federal and state income tax laws as well as foreign tax laws. We review our uncertain tax positions quarterly, and we may adjust these unrecognized tax benefits in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Income and Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

Net interest income is defined as the difference between interest earned on loans, available-for-sale securities and short-term investment securities, and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest income is our principal source of revenue. Net interest margin is defined as the amount of annualized net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis to consistently reflect income from taxable loans and securities and tax-exempt securities based on the federal statutory tax rate of 35.0 percent.



Analysis of Net Interest Income Changes Due to Volume and Rate (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “volume change.” Net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “rate change.” The following table sets forth changes in interest income for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest expense for each major category of interest-bearing liabilities. The table also reflects the amount of simultaneous changes attributable to both volume and rate changes for the years indicated. For this table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and average rate.

Net Interest Income (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)


compared to


Net interest income increased by

$79.3 million

to

$699.1 million

in


, compared to

$619.8 million

in


. Overall, we saw an increase in our net interest income primarily due to higher average loan balances and a higher overall yield on our available-for-sale-securities portfolio, primarily from lower premium amortization expense. These increases were partially offset by lower yields earned on our loans and available-for-sale securities.

The main factors affecting interest income and interest expense for


, compared to


, are discussed below:

•

Interest income

for


increased by

$80.7 million

primarily due to:

◦

A

$73.1 million

increase in interest income on loans to

$542.2 million

in 2013, compared to

$469.1 million

in 2012. This increase was reflective of an increase in average loan balances of $

1.8 billion

, partially offset by a decrease of


basis points in the overall yield on our loan portfolio. The decrease in yields was reflective of a shift in the mix of our late stage and sponsor-led buyout portfolios from national Prime rate, to LIBOR, indexed loans, in addition to, lower rates on existing and new capital call lines, as a result of increased competition.



We expect our loan yields will continue to be impacted by the shift in the mix of our late stage and sponsor-led buyout loans, as well as, increased pressure on the yield of our capital call lines in 2014, as a result of increased competition and the overall low interest rate environment. The 3-month LIBOR index rate was approximately 300 basis points lower than the national Prime rate at December 31, 2013.

◦

A

$7.7 million

increase in interest income on available-for-sale securities to

$185.1 million

in 2013, compared to

$177.3 million

in 2012. The increase of

$7.7 million

was primarily due to:

▪

An increase of $25.8 million resulting from the decrease in premium amortization expense.  Premium amortization expense for the year ended is $29.8 million, compared to $55.6 million.  The decrease in premium amortization expense is reflective of higher treasury rates during 2013 resulting in a slow-down of prepayments during 2013 as compared to 2012.  Average 5-year, and 10-year, treasury bill rates were higher by 41, and 55, basis points, respectively, for 2013 as compared to 2012.

▪

A decrease of $16.3 million as a result of a decline in yields and $1.6 million reflective of lower volume resulting from the strategic timing of the investment of excess cash during the low interest rate environment throughout most of 2013.

▪

Interest income, excluding premium amortization expense, for the year ended is $215.0 million, compared to $232.9 million.

•

Interest expense

for


increased by

$1.4 million

primarily due to:

◦

An increase in interest expense from interest-bearing deposits of

$2.5 million

, primarily due to an

$831 million

increase in average money market deposits at a slightly higher yield in 2013 compared to 2012.

◦

A decrease in interest expense of $1.0 million related to our long-term debt, primarily due to the maturity and repayment of our 5.70% Senior Notes of $141.0 million on June 1, 2012.

2012 compared to 2011

Net interest income increased by $91.6 million to $619.8 million in 2012, compared to $528.2 million in 2011. Overall, we saw an increase in our net interest income primarily due to higher average loan balances and growth in our available-for-sale securities portfolio, which has increased as a result of our continued growth in deposits. These increases were partially offset by lower yields earned on our loans and available-for-sale securities.

The main factors affecting interest income and interest expense for 2012 compared to 2011 are discussed below:

•

Interest income

for 2012 increased by $83.3 million primarily due to:

◦

A $79.3 million increase in interest income on loans to $469.1 million in 2012, compared to $389.8 million in 2011. This increase was reflective of an increase in average loan balances of $1.7 billion, partially offset by a decrease of 49 basis points in the overall yield on our loan portfolio. The decrease in yields was reflective of a continued shift in the mix of our loans that are indexed to the national Prime rate versus the SVB Prime rate. We expect our loan yields will continue to be impacted by this shift in the mix of our loans in 2013, as we expect we will continue to index more loans to the national Prime rate, instead of our SVB Prime rate. The national Prime rate was 75 basis points lower than the SVB Prime rate as of December 31, 2012.

◦

A $6.3 million increase in interest income on available-for-sale securities to $177.3 million in 2012, compared to $171.0 million in 2011. The increase of $6.3 million was primarily due to:

▪

A $22.4 million increase related to higher average balances of $1.3 billion.

▪

An $11.6 million increase related to higher yields, reflective of a shift in our portfolio to a smaller proportion of lower-yielding variable-rate securities as we did not purchase any of these securities in 2012. For 2012, average variable-rate securities were $2.1 billion, or 19.7 percent of our portfolio, compared to $2.7 billion, or 28.9 percent for 2011. The coupon rate on these securities resets based on changes in the one-month LIBOR rate.

▪

A $27.7 million decrease related to higher premium amortization expense, which increased to $55.6 million in 2012 from $27.9 million in 2011. The increase in premium amortization expense was reflective of an increase in mortgage prepayment levels on our fixed rate mortgage securities. As of December 31, 2012, the remaining unamortized premium balance on our available-for-sale securities portfolio was $115.0 million.



•

Interest expense

for 2012 decreased by $8.3 million primarily due to:

◦

A decrease in interest expense of $6.2 million related to our long-term debt, primarily due to the maturity of $250.0 million of our 3.875% Convertible Notes in April 2011, as well as the repurchase of $109 million of our 5.70% Senior Notes and $204 million of our 6.05% Subordinated Notes in May 2011.

◦

A decrease in interest expense from interest-bearing deposits of $2.2 million, primarily due to decreases in rates paid on deposits throughout 2011, which was reflective of market rates.

Net Interest Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

Our net interest margin increased to

3.29 percent

in


, compared to

3.19 percent

in


and

3.08 percent

in


.

The net interest income factors discussed above affected our net interest margin in


as follows:

•

A 14 basis point increase in net interest margin due to increased net interest income from loans, primarily from an increase of

$1.8 billion

in average loan balances (higher-yielding assets).

•

A 4 basis point decrease in net interest margin due to a larger proportion of our available for sale securities portfolio, invested in lower-yielding US Agency securities.

The net interest income factors discussed above affected our net interest margin in 2012 as follows:

•

An increase in net interest margin from an increase of $1.7 billion in average loan balances (higher-yielding assets).

•

An increase in net interest margin from lower cash balances as a result of deployment into available-for-sale securities, which has resulted in a favorable change in our mix of interest-earning assets.

•

An increase in net interest margin from an increase in yields on our available-for-sale securities, which was reflective of a shift in our portfolio to a smaller proportion of lower-yielding variable-rate securities.

•

A decrease in net interest margin from a decrease in the overall yield on our loan portfolio resulting from changes in loan mix.

•

A decrease in net interest margin from an increase in premium amortization expense on our available-for-sale securities portfolio.

Average Balances, Yields and Rates Paid (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

The average yield earned on interest-earning assets is the amount of annualized fully taxable equivalent interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The average rate paid on funding sources is the amount of annualized interest expense expressed as a percentage of average funding sources. The following tables set forth average assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and SVBFG stockholders’ equity, interest income, interest expense, annualized yields and rates, and the composition of our annualized net interest margin in

Provision for Loan Losses

Our provision for loan losses is based on our evaluation of the existing allowance for loan losses in relation to total gross loans using historical and other objective information, and on our qualitative assessment of the inherent and identified credit risks of the loan portfolio. For a more detailed discussion of credit quality and the allowance for loan losses, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and “-Consolidated Financial Condition-Credit Quality and the Allowance for Loan Losses” below.

The following table summarizes our allowance for loan losses for


,


and


, respectively:

We had a provision for loan losses of

$63.7 million

in


, compared to a provision of

$44.3 million

in


. The provision of

$63.7 million

in


was primarily driven by net charge-offs of $31.5 million and period-end loan growth of

$2.0 billion

resulting in a provision of $21.9 million. Gross loan charge-offs of

$42.7 million

and loan recoveries of

$11.2 million

were primarily from our hardware, software and other commercial client portfolios.

We had a provision for loan losses of

$44.3 million

in


, compared to a provision of

6.1 million

in


. The provision of

$44.3 million

in


was primarily due to net charge-offs of $23.6 million as well as a provision of $23.1 million reflective of period-end loan growth of $2.0 billion.  Gross loan charge-offs of $33.3 million in


were primarily from our hardware client portfolio. Loan recoveries of $9.7 million in


were primarily from our software client portfolio.

Our impaired loans totaled

$52 million

at December 31, 2013, compared to

$38 million

at December 31, 2012. The allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans was

$21 million

at December 31, 2013, compared to

$6 million

at December 31, 2012.  The increase came primarily from four loans within our software and hardware portfolios.

This non-GAAP measure represents noninterest income, but excludes certain line items where performance is typically subject to market or other conditions beyond our control.

Included in net income is income and expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. We recognize, as part of our investment funds management business through SVB Capital and Debt Fund Investments, the entire income or loss from funds where we own significantly less than 100% of the investment. We are required under GAAP to consolidate 100% of the results of entities that we are deemed to control, even though we may own less than 100% of such entities. The relevant amounts attributable to investors other than us are reflected under “Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests” on our statements of income. Where applicable, the non-GAAP tables presented below for noninterest income and net gains on investment securities exclude noncontrolling interests, as well as gains from sales of certain available-for-sale-securities and certain other assets. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that represent income attributable to investors other than us and our subsidiaries. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.



The following table provides a summary of non-GAAP noninterest income, net of noncontrolling interests:

Foreign Exchange Fees

Foreign exchange fees represent the income differential between purchases and sales of foreign currency on behalf of our clients and offsetting trades with correspondent banks. Foreign exchange fees were

$57.4 million

in


, compared to

$52.4 million

and

$45.8 million

in


and


, respectively. The increases reflect improving business conditions for our clients, which has resulted in a higher number of trades as well as an improvement in our spread. Additionally, the increase has been influenced by growth in our larger, later-stage client base that typically uses more foreign exchange products.

Credit Card Fees

Credit card fees were

$32.5 million

in


, compared to

$24.8 million

and

$18.7 million

in


and


, respectively. The increases reflect increased client awareness of our credit card products and the introduction of custom payment solutions, which has resulted in new credit card clients and an increase in client activity. Custom payment solutions primarily utilize virtual cards for clients with high volume payment processing needs.

Lending Related Fees

Lending related fees were

$21.0 million

in


, compared to

$18.0 million

and

$8.9 million

in


and


, respectively. The increase in 2013 is due to an increase in unused commitment fees as our loan commitments available for funding balance increased from $8 billion to $10 billion.  The increase in 2012 included a $5.9 million increase in unused commitment fees, primarily resulting from the prospective reclassification of certain fees from interest income to noninterest income. The comparable amount of these fees included in interest income in 2011 was $5.2 million.

Client Investment Fees

We offer a variety of investment products on which we earn fees. These products include money market mutual funds, overnight repurchase agreements, sweep money market funds and fixed income securities available through client-directed accounts offered through SVB Securities, our broker dealer subsidiary, and fixed income management services offered through SVB Asset Management, our investment advisory subsidiary.

Client investment fees were

$14.0 million

in


, compared to

$14.5 million

and

$12.4 million

in


and


, respectively.  The decrease in 2013 from 2012 is reflective of lower margins earned on certain products owing to the overall low rates in the short-term fixed income markets.  The increase in 2012 from 2011 was primarily a result of our clients' increased utilization of our off-balance sheet sweep money market funds.

Gains on Investment Securities, Net

Net gains on investment securities include both gains from our non-marketable and other securities, as well as gains from sales of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, when applicable.

Our available-for-sale securities portfolio is a fixed income investment portfolio that is managed to earn an appropriate portfolio yield over the long-term while maintaining sufficient liquidity and credit diversification as well as addressing our asset/liability management objectives. Though infrequent, the sale of investments from our available-for-sale portfolio results in net gains or losses on investment securities, and are within the guidelines of our investment policy of managing our liquidity position and interest rate risk. Pre-tax gains from the sale of certain available-for-sale securities were minimal during 2013 and 2012.

Our non-marketable and other securities portfolio primarily represents investments in venture capital and private equity funds, venture debt funds and private and public portfolio companies. We experience variability in the performance of our non-marketable and other securities from period to period, which results in net gains or losses on investment securities (both realized and unrealized). This variability is due to a number of factors, including unrealized changes in the fair value of our investments, changes in the amount of realized gains from distributions, or changes in liquidity events and general economic and market conditions. Unrealized gains from non-marketable and other securities for any single period are typically driven by valuation changes, and are therefore subject to potential increases or decreases in future periods. Such variability may lead to volatility in the gains or losses from investment securities and as such our results for a particular period are not necessarily indicative of our expected performance in a future period.

The extent to which any unrealized gains will become realized is subject to a variety of factors, including, among other things, the expiration of certain sales restrictions to which these securities are subject, the actual sales of securities and the timing of such actual sales.

In


we had net gains on investment securities of

$419.4 million

, compared to

$122.1 million

and

$195.0 million

in

and

$32.7 million

in


and


, respectively. Net gains, net of noncontrolling interests and excluding gains on sales of certain available-for-sale securities, of

$77.3 million

in


were driven by the following:

•

Gains of

$42.1 million

from our managed direct venture funds, primarily driven by the increase in valuation and carried interest allocations related to FireEye and Twitter.  Both FireEye and Twitter are each subject to a lock-up agreement.



•

Gains of

$15.0 million

mainly attributable to four of our managed funds of funds, primarily related to unrealized valuation increases due to strong IPO and other exit activity across the portfolio.

•

Gains of

$10.2 million

from our strategic and other investments, primarily driven by strong distributions from strategic venture capital fund investments.

•

Gains of

$9.4 million

from our investments in debt funds, primarily due to our pro-rata interest in equity gains in the fund portfolio.

•

Gains of

$3.0 million

on the revaluation of foreign currency instruments, compared to gains of

$1.7 million

in 2012. The revaluation gains were primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and Pound Sterling.

The increase of $15.1 million in 2012 was primarily due to the following:

•

Gains of $4.2 million on the sale of certain assets related to our equity management services business in the second quarter of 2012.

•

Currency revaluation losses of $16 thousand in 2012, compared to losses of $4.3 million in 2011. The losses of $4.3 million in 2011 were primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Indian Rupee.

•

Gains on the revaluation of foreign currency instruments of $1.7 million in 2012 compared to losses of $2.1 million in 2011. The revaluation gains were primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and Pound Sterling.



Noninterest Expense

A summary of noninterest income for


,


and


is as follows:

Included in noninterest expense is expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. See below for a summary of non-GAAP noninterest expense and non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio, both of which exclude noncontrolling interests.

Non-GAAP Noninterest Expense

We use and report non-GAAP noninterest expense, non-GAAP taxable equivalent revenue and non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio, which excludes noncontrolling interests and net gains from note repurchases and termination of corresponding interest rate swaps (when applicable). We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by: (i) excluding certain items that represent expenses attributable to investors other than us and our subsidiaries, or certain items that do not occur every reporting period; or (ii) providing additional information used by management that is not otherwise required by GAAP or other applicable requirements. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The table below provides a summary of non-GAAP noninterest expense and non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio, both net of noncontrolling interests:



NM—Not meaningful

(1)

The non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non-GAAP noninterest expense by non-GAAP total taxable-equivalent income.

Compensation and Benefits Expense

The following table provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense:

(1)

Other employee benefits includes employer payroll taxes, group health and life insurance, share-based compensation,        401(k), warrant incentive and retention program plans, agency fees and other employee related expenses.

Compensation and benefits expense was

$366.8 million

in


, compared to

$326.9 million

in


and

$313.0 million

in


. The key changes in factors driving the increase in compensation and benefits expense in 2013 were as follows:

•

An increase of

$16.8 million

in incentive compensation and ESOP expense, primarily reflective of higher expenses in 2013 as a result of strong performance relative to our internal performance targets for the year.

•

An increase of

$14.1 million

in other employee benefits, primarily due to warrant incentive program plan expense resulting from the gains recorded for the increase in valuation related to IPOs in 2013 and share-based plan expense primarily as a result of the increase in the valuation of the SVB Financial's common stock.  The remaining increases related to various other employee benefits.



•

An increase of

$8.9 million

in salaries and wages expense, primarily due to an increase in the number of average FTEs, as well as from merit increases. Average FTEs increased by


to

1,669

in


, compared to

1,581

in


, primarily to support our product development, operational and sales and advisory, as well as to support our commercial banking operations and initiatives.

The increase in compensation and benefits expense of $13.9 million in 2012 was primarily due to the following:

•

An increase of $15.8 million in salaries and wages expense, primarily due to an increase in the number of average FTEs, as well as from merit increases. Average FTEs increased by 130 to 1,581 in 2012, compared to 1,451 in 2011, primarily to support our product development, operational and sales and advisory, as well as to support our commercial banking operations and initiatives.

•

An increase of $8.7 million in other employee benefits, primarily due to an increase in average FTEs, as well as an increase in 401(k) expenses and employer payroll taxes driven by 2011 incentive compensation payouts during the first quarter of 2012, which were at higher levels than 2010 incentive compensation payouts in the first quarter of 2011.

•

A decrease of $10.6 million in incentive compensation and ESOP expense, primarily reflective of higher expenses in 2011 as a result of better than expected results for that period.

Our variable compensation plans primarily consist of our Incentive Compensation Plan, Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan, 401(k) and ESOP Plan, Retention Program and Warrant Incentive Plan. Total costs incurred under these plans were

$123.2 million

in


, compared to

$101.2 million

in


and

$110.3 million

in


. These amounts are included in total compensation and benefits expense discussed above.

Professional Services

Professional services expense was

$76.2 million

in


, compared to

$67.8 million

in


and

$60.8 million

in


. The increases were primarily due to increased consulting fees related to our ongoing business and IT infrastructure initiatives.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment expense was

$45.9 million

in


, compared to

$40.7 million

in


and

$28.3 million

in


. The increases were primarily due to increased spending to enhance and maintain our IT infrastructure.

Business Development and Travel

Business development and travel expense was

$33.3 million

in


, compared to

$29.4 million

in


and

$24.3 million

in


. The increases were primarily reflective of our increased focus on global initiatives and increased business development activity due to improving economic and business conditions.

Net Occupancy

Net occupancy expense was

$24.9 million

in


, compared to

$22.5 million

in


and

$19.6 million

in


. The increases were reflective of lease renewals at higher rates and the expansion of certain existing offices in both 2013 and 2012.

Provision for Unfunded Credit Commitments

We recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of

$7.6 million

in


, compared to

$0.5 million

in


and

$4.4 million

in


. The provision in


was primarily due to growth in total unfunded credit commitments and letters of credit balances which increased by

$2.9 billion

to

$11.5 billion

in 2013 from

$8.6 billion

in 2012.

The provision for unfunded credit commitments of $0.5 million in 2012 was primarily reflective of a decrease in the reserve rate applied to our unfunded commitments due to improved credit performance across our client portfolio. Additionally, growth in total unfunded credit commitments and letters of credit balances was $543 million in 2012, compared to $1.1 billion in 2011.

Other Noninterest Expense

A summary of other noninterest expense for


,


and


is as follows:



(1)

Represents net gains from the repurchase of $109 million of our 5.70% Senior Notes and $204 million of our 6.05% Subordinated Notes and the termination of the corresponding portions of interest rate swaps in 2011.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

Included in net income is income and expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. The relevant amounts attributable to investors other than us are reflected under “Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests” in our statements of income.

In the table below, noninterest income consists primarily of investment gains and losses from our consolidated funds. Noninterest expense is primarily related to management fees paid by our managed funds to SVB Financial’s subsidiaries as the funds’ general partners. A summary of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for


,


and


is as follows:

NM—Not meaningful

(1)

Represents noncontrolling interests’ share in net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense.

(2)

Represents the preferred allocation of income earned by the general partners or limited partners of certain consolidated funds.

Income Taxes

Our effective income tax expense rate was

39.2 percent

in


, compared to

39.3 percent

in


and

40.9 percent

in


.

The decrease in the tax rate in 2013  was primarily attributable to lower state taxes offset by a one-time prior period tax expense adjustment of $2.9 million. The decrease in the tax rate in 2012 was primarily attributable to lower state taxes and lower taxes on foreign operations.

Our effective tax rate is calculated by dividing income tax expense by the sum of income before income tax expense and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Operating Segment Results

We have three segments for which we report our financial information: Global Commercial Bank, SVB Private Bank and SVB Capital.

We report segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reporting segments. Please



refer to Note 20—”Segment Reporting” of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional details.

Our primary source of revenue is from net interest income, which is primarily the difference between interest earned on loans, net of FTP, and interest paid on deposits, net of FTP. Accordingly, our segments are reported using net interest income, net of FTP. FTP is an internal measurement framework designed to assess the financial impact of a financial institution’s sources and uses of funds. It is the mechanism by which an earnings credit is given for deposits raised, and an earnings charge is made for funded loans.

We also evaluate performance based on provision for loan losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense, which are presented as components of segment operating profit or loss. In calculating each operating segment’s noninterest expense, we consider the direct costs incurred by the operating segment as well as certain allocated direct costs. As part of this review, we allocate certain corporate overhead costs to a corporate account. We do not allocate income taxes to our segments. Additionally, our management reporting model is predicated on average asset balances; therefore, period-end asset balances are not presented for segment reporting purposes.

Changes in an individual client’s primary relationship designation have resulted, and in the future may result, in the inclusion of certain clients in different segments in different periods. The following is our reportable segment information for


,


and


:

Global Commercial Bank

NM—Not meaningful

Income before income tax expense from our Global Commercial Bank (“GCB”) increased to

$343.8 million

in 2013, compared to

$340.1 million

in


and

$303.3 million

in


, which reflects the continued growth of our core commercial business and clients, with an increase in pressure on overall loan yields as a result of the low interest rate environment and increased competition. The key components of GCB's performance are discussed below:


compared to


Net interest income from our GCB increased by

$47.9 million

in


, primarily due to a

$70.8 million

increase in loan interest income resulting mainly from an increase in average loan balances, partially offset by lower loan yields. Additionally, our GCB had a

$13.0 million

increase in the FTP earned for deposits due to average deposit growth. These increases were partially offset by a

$38.7 million

decrease in the FTP earned for deposits from decreases in market interest rates.

We had a provision for loan losses for GCB of

$65.3 million

in


, compared to

$45.4 million

in


. The provision of

$65.3 million

was primarily due to net charge-offs and period-end loan growth of

$2.0 billion

resulting in a provision of $21.9M.

Noninterest income increased by

$13.6 million

in


, primarily due to higher credit card fees and  foreign exchange fees. The increase in credit card fees reflect increased client awareness of our credit card products and the introduction of custom payment solutions, which has resulted in new credit card clients and an increase in client activity. Custom payment solutions primarily utilize virtual cards for clients with high volume payment processing needs. The increase in foreign exchange fees was primarily due to improved business conditions for our clients, which has resulted in an increase in the number of trades and commissioned notional volumes.

Noninterest expense increased by

$37.9 million

in


, primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and  premises and equipment. Incentive compensation increased primarily from better than expected results in 2013.  Higher



compensation and benefits expenses were attributable to increased incentive plan and salaries and wages expenses. The increase in our incentive plan expenses was primarily related to our strong performance in 2013, which we exceeded internal performance targets.  The increase in salaries and wages was primarily due to an increase in the average number of FTEs at GCB, which increased by


to

1,329

in


, compared to

1,244

in


. The increase in average FTEs was attributable to increases in positions for product development, operational and sales and advisory, as well as to support our commercial banking operations and initiatives.  The increase in premises and equipment was primarily due to increased spending to enhance and maintain our IT infrastructure.


compared to


Net interest income from our GCB increased by $76.0 million in 2012, primarily due to a $80.8 million increase in loan interest income resulting mainly from an increase in average loan balances and a $24.1 million increase in the FTP earned for deposits due to deposit growth. These increases were partially offset by a $25.9 million decrease in the FTP earned for deposits from decreases in market interest rates.

We had a provision for loan losses for GCB of $45.4 million in 2012, compared to a provision of $13.5 million in 2011. The provision of $45.4 million in 2012 was primarily due to net charge-offs and period-end loan growth. The provision of $13.5 million in 2011 was primarily due to period-end loan growth, partially offset by a decrease in the allowance for our performing loans due to the strong overall credit quality of our clients.

Noninterest income increased by $38.7 million in 2012, primarily due to an increase in gains from debt fund investments, foreign exchange fees and credit card fees, as well as gains of $4.2 million on the sale of certain assets related to our equity management services business in the second quarter of 2012. The increase in gains from debt fund investments was driven primarily by IPO and M&A activity and other valuation increases from the investments within the funds. The increase in foreign exchange fees was primarily due to improving business conditions for our clients and increased volatility in foreign markets, which has resulted in an improvement in our spread as well as higher number of trades. The increase in credit card fees was primarily due to the addition of new credit card clients and an increase in client activity.

Noninterest expense increased by $46.0 million in 2012, primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages, premises and equipment and professional services. The increase in salaries and wages was primarily due to an increase in the average number of FTEs within GCB, which increased by 108 to 1,244 in 2012, compared to 1,136 in 2011, as well as from base salary merit increases. The increase in average FTEs was attributable to increases in positions for product development, operational and sales and advisory, as well as to support our commercial banking operations and initiatives. The increase in premises and equipment was primarily due to increased spending to enhance and maintain our IT infrastructure, as well as the write-off of certain assets. The increase in professional services was primarily due to increased consulting fees related to our ongoing business and infrastructure initiatives.

SVB Private Bank

Income before income tax expense from SVB Private Bank increased to

$13.6 million

in


, compared to

$9.9 million

in


and

$17.3 million

in


. The key drivers of SVB Private Bank's performance are discussed below:


compared to


Net interest income from SVB Private Bank increased by

$4.9 million

in


, primarily from an increase in loan interest income from an increase in average loan balances and an increase in the FTP earned for deposits due to average deposit growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the overall yield on our Private Bank loan portfolio, reflective of the current low interest rate environment.



Noninterest expense increased by

$2.3 million

in


, primarily due to increased incentive plan expenses due to our strong performance in 2013, which we exceeded internal performance targets.


compared to


Net interest income from SVB Private Bank increased by $2.3 million in 2012, primarily due to an increase in the FTP earned for deposits due to deposit growth and an increase in loan interest income resulting primarily from an increase in average loan balances.

SVB Private Bank had a reduction of provision for loan losses of $1.1 million in 2012, compared to a reduction of provision of $7.4 million in 2011. The reduction of provision for both periods was primarily due to net loan recoveries.

Noninterest expense increased by $3.5 million in 2012, primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense resulting from an increase in the average number of FTEs at SVB Private Bank, which increased by 9 to 43 in 2012, compared to 34 in 2011. The increase in average FTEs was to support the growth of SVB Private Bank.

SVB Capital

NM—Not meaningful

SVB Capital’s components of noninterest income primarily include net gains and losses on non-marketable and other securities, carried interest and fund management fees. All components of income before income tax expense discussed below are net of noncontrolling interests.

We experience variability in the performance of SVB Capital from period to period due to a number of factors, including changes in the values of our funds’ underlying investments, changes in the amount of distributions and general economic and market conditions. Such variability may lead to volatility in the gains and losses from investment securities and cause our results to differ from period to period. Results for a particular period may not be indicative of future performance.

Income before income tax expense from SVB Capital increased to

$64.3 million

in 2013, compared to

$16.2 million

in 2012 and

$14.3 million

in 2011, which reflects significant gains from our managed funds. The key drivers of SVB Capital's performance are discussed below:

December 31, 2013

and

December 31, 2012

,

$715 million

and

$72 million

, respectively, of our cash and due from banks was deposited at the FRB and was earning interest at the Federal Funds target rate, and interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions were

$300 million

and

$283 million

, respectively.

Investment Securities

Investment securities totaled

$13.6 billion

at

December 31, 2013

, an increase of

$1.1 billion

, or

8.4 percent

, compared to

$12.5 billion

at

Our investment securities portfolio consists of both an available-for-sale securities portfolio, which represents interest-earning investment securities, and a non-marketable and other securities portfolio, which primarily represents investments managed as part of our funds management business. The following table presents a profile of our investment securities portfolio at

December 31, 2013

,


and


:



Available-for-Sale Securities

Our available-for-sale securities portfolio is a fixed income investment portfolio that is managed to earn an appropriate portfolio yield over the long-term while maintaining sufficient liquidity and credit diversification as well as addressing our asset/liability management objectives. Available-for-sale securities were

$12.0 billion

at

December 31, 2013

, an increase of

$0.6 billion

, or

5.7 percent

, compared to

$11.3 billion

at

December 31, 2012

, which increased by

$0.8 billion

or

7.7 percent

, compared to

$10.5 billion

at

December 31, 2011

. The increase in


was primarily due to purchases of new investments of

$3.3 billion

, partially offset by paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities of

$2.4 billion

. The purchases of new investments of

$3.3 billion

were primarily comprised of fixed-rate agency-issued mortgage securities and fixed-rate agency debentures. The paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities on securities of

$2.4 billion

were comprised of

$1.8 billion

in fixed-rate securities and

$0.6 billion

in variable-rate securities.

The increase in 2012 was primarily due to purchases of new investments of $3.9 billion, partially offset by paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities of $2.7 billion and sales of $329 million. The purchases of new investments of $3.9 billion were primarily comprised of fixed-rate agency-issued mortgage securities and fixed-rate agency debentures. The paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities on securities of $2.7 billion were comprised of $2.1 billion in fixed-rate securities and $657 million in variable-rate securities. The sales of $329 million were primarily comprised of U.S. agency securities. These securities were sold as part of our portfolio management strategy of managing duration risk.

Portfolio duration is a standard measure used to approximate changes in the market value of fixed income instruments due to a change in market interest rates. The measure is an estimate based on the level of current market interest rates, expectations for changes in the path of forward rates and the effect of forward rates on mortgage prepayment speed assumptions. As such, portfolio duration will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates. Changes in portfolio duration are also impacted by changes in the mix of longer versus shorter term-to-maturity securities. At

December 31, 2013

, our estimated portfolio duration was

3.3

years, compared to

2.2

, and 1.8, years at

December 31, 2012

and 2011, respectively.



Non-Marketable and Other Securities

Our non-marketable and other securities portfolio primarily represents investments in venture capital and private equity funds, debt funds and private and public portfolio companies. A majority of these investments are managed through our SVB Capital funds business in funds of funds and direct venture and private equity funds. Included in our non-marketable and other securities carried under fair value accounting are amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests. We are required under GAAP to consolidate 100% of these investments that we are deemed to control, even though we may own less than 100% of such entities. See below for a summary of the carrying value (as reported) of non-marketable and other securities compared to the amounts attributable to SVBFG.

Non-marketable and other securities were

$1.6 billion

at

December 31, 2013

, an increase of

$411 million

, or

34.7 percent

, compared to

$1.2 billion

at

December 31, 2012

, which increased by

$180 million

or

17.9 percent

, compared to

$1.0 billion

at

December 31, 2011

.

The increase in non-marketable and other securities of

$411 million

in


was primarily related to the following:

◦

Gains of $230 million  from our managed direct venture funds, driven by the continued strong stock performance of successful portfolio company IPOs during the year.

◦

Gains of $170 million from our managed funds of funds, primarily related to unrealized valuation increases from IPO, M&A activity and other valuation increases across the portfolio.

The increase in non-marketable and other securities of $180 million in 2012 was primarily related to the following:

•

Funding of our capital contribution of $80 million to our joint venture bank in China in the second quarter of 2012, which is included in the line item "Other investments" under equity method accounting.

•

An increase of $54 million in venture capital and private equity investments accounted for using fair value accounting from our managed funds of funds due to additional capital calls (net of distributions) for fund investments, as well as from valuation increases.

•

An increase of $35 million in low income housing tax credit funds due to new investments.

The following table summarizes the carrying value (as reported) of non-marketable and other securities compared to the amounts attributable to SVBFG (which generally represents the carrying value times our ownership percentage) at

Investments classified as other securities (fair value accounting) represent direct equity investments in public companies held by our consolidated funds. This amount primarily includes total unrealized gains of $294 million in two of our public portfolio companies, FireEye and Twitter, both of which are currently subject to lock-up agreements. The extent to which any unrealized gains will become realized is subject to a variety of factors, including, among other things, the expiration of certain sales restrictions to which these securities are subject, the actual sales of securities and the timing of such actual sales.



Loans

The following table details the composition of the loan portfolio, net of unearned income, as of the five most recent year-ends:

We saw an increase in commercial loans from

December 31, 2012

to

December 31, 2013

in all of our client industry segments, with particularly strong growth in sponsor-led buyouts by later stage clients in our software portfolio, as well as from capital call lines of credit for our venture capital/private equity clients.



Loan Concentration

Loan concentrations may exist when there are borrowers engaged in similar activities or types of loans extended to a diverse group of borrowers that could cause those borrowers or portfolios to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. A substantial percentage of our loans are commercial in nature. The breakdown of total gross loans and total loans as a percentage of gross loans by industry sector is as follows:

(1)

Premium wine clients can have loan balances included in both commercial loans and real estate secured loans, the total of which are used for the breakout of the above categories.

(2)

Consumer loan clients have loan balances included in both real estate secured loans and other consumer loans, the total of which are used for the breakout of the above categories.



The following table provides a summary of gross loans by size and category. The breakout of the categories is based on total client balances (individually or in the aggregate) as of

December 31, 2013

:

(1)

Premium wine clients can have loan balances included in both commercial loans and real estate secured loans, the total of which are used for the breakout of the above categories.

(2)

Consumer loan clients have loan balances included in both real estate secured loans and other consumer loans, the total of which are used for the breakout of the above categories.

At

December 31, 2013

, gross loans equal to or greater than $20 million to any single client (individually or in the aggregate) totaled

$4.2 billion

, or

38.4 percent

of our portfolio. These loans represented


clients, and of these loans,

none

were on nonaccrual status as of

December 31, 2013

.

The following table provides a summary of gross loans by size and category. The breakout of the categories is based on total client balances (individually or in the aggregate) as of

December 31, 2012

:

Premium wine clients can have loan balances included in both commercial loans and real estate secured loans, the total of which are used for the breakout of the above categories.

(2)

Consumer loan clients have loan balances included in both real estate secured loans and other consumer loans, the total of which are used for the breakout of the above categories.

At

December 31, 2012

, gross loans equal to or greater than $20 million to any single client (individually or in the aggregate) totaled

$3.1 billion

, or

34.8 percent

of our portfolio. These loans represented


clients, and of these loans,

none

were on nonaccrual status as of

December 31, 2012

.

The credit profile of our clients varies across our loan portfolio, based on the nature of the lending we do for different market segments. Our technology and life sciences loan portfolio includes loans to clients at all stages of their life cycles, beginning with our SVB Accelerator practice, which serves our emerging or early-stage clients. Loans provided to early-stage clients represent a relatively small percentage of our overall portfolio at approximately

9.2 percent

of total gross loans at both

December 31, 2013

and 2012 . Typically, these loans are made to companies with modest or negative cash flows and no established record of profitable operations. Repayment of these loans may be dependent upon receipt by borrowers of additional equity financing from venture capitalists or others, or in some cases, a successful sale to a third party or a public offering. Venture capital firms may provide financing at lower levels, more selectively or on less favorable terms, which may have an adverse effect on our borrowers that are otherwise dependent on such financing to repay their loans to us. When repayment is dependent upon the next round of venture investment and there is an indication that further investment is unlikely or will not occur, it is often likely the company would need to be sold to repay its debt in full. If reasonable efforts have not yielded a likely buyer willing to repay all debt at the close of the sale or on commercially viable terms, the account will most likely be deemed to be impaired.

At

December 31, 2013

, our lending to venture capital/private equity firms represented

21.9 percent

of total gross loans, compared to

19.4 percent

of total gross loans at

December 31, 2012

. Many of these clients have capital call lines of credit, the repayment of which is dependent on the payment of capital calls by the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by these firms.

At

December 31, 2013

, sponsor-led buyout loans represented

12.5

percent of total gross loans, compared to

11.8

percent of total gross loans at

December 31, 2012

. These loans are typically larger in nature and repayment is generally dependent upon the cash flows of the acquired company. However, these loans are typically highly-secured and therefore carry lower credit risk.

At

December 31, 2013

, our asset-based lending, which consists primarily of working capital lines and accounts receivable factoring represented

7.3 percent

and

4.2 percent

, respectively, of total gross loans, compared to

7.0 percent

and

4.8 percent

, respectively at

December 31, 2012

. The repayment of these arrangements is dependent on the financial condition, and payment ability, of third parties with whom our clients do business.

Approximately

39.7 percent

of our outstanding total gross loan balances as of

December 31, 2013

were to borrowers based in California compared to

38.5 percent

as of

December 31, 2012

. Other than California, there were no states with balances greater than 10 percent.

As of

December 31, 2013

,

78.4 percent

, or

$8.6 billion

, of our outstanding total gross loans were variable-rate loans that adjust at a prescribed measurement date upon a change in our prime-lending rate or other variable indices, compared to

76.3 percent

, or

$6.9 billion

, as of

December 31, 2012

. The following table sets forth the remaining contractual maturity distribution of our gross loans by industry sector at

December 31, 2013

, for fixed and variable rate loans:



Upon maturity, loans satisfying our credit quality standards may be eligible for renewal. Such renewals are subject to the normal underwriting and credit administration practices associated with new loans. We do not grant loans with unconditional extension terms.



Loan Administration

The Credit Committee of our Board of Directors (formerly the Directors' Loan Committee) oversees our credit risks and strategies, as well as our credit policies and lending practices.

Subject to the oversight of the Credit Committee, lending authority is delegated to the Chief Credit Officer and our management's Loan Committee, which consists of the Chief Credit Officer and other senior members of our lending management. Requests for new and existing credit extensions that meet certain size and underwriting criteria may be approved outside of our Loan Committee by designated senior lenders or jointly with a senior credit officer or division risk manager.

Credit Quality Indicators

As of

December 31, 2013

, our criticized and impaired loans represented

5.7 percent

of our total gross loans. This compares to

6.6 percent

at

December 31, 2012

. A majority of our criticized loans are from our SVB Accelerator portfolio, serving our emerging or early stage clients. Loans to early stage clients make up approximately

9 percent

of our loan portfolio. It is common for an emerging early stage client’s remaining liquidity to fall temporarily below the threshold for a pass-rated credit during its capital-raising period for a new round of funding. This situation typically lasts only a few weeks and, in our experience, generally resolves itself with a subsequent round of venture funding. As a result, we expect that each of our early-stage clients will be managed through our criticized portfolio during a portion of their life cycle. Criticized loan levels will continue to vary but are expected to remain within the current range.



Credit Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses

The following table presents a summary of the activity for the allowance for loan losses as of the five most recent year-ends:



The following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among specific classes of loans as of the five most recent year-ends:

(1)

Represents loan category as a percentage of total gross loans as of year-end.



Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets consist of loans on nonaccrual status and foreclosed property classified as Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”). We measure all loans placed on nonaccrual status for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral or the net present value of the expected cash flows. The table below sets forth certain data and ratios between nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and the allowance for loan losses:

(1)

The “Reserve for unfunded credit commitments” is included as a component of other liabilities. See “Provision for Unfunded Credit Commitments” above for a discussion of the changes to the reserve.

(2)

Includes unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.



Nonaccrual Loans

is as follows:

NM—Not meaningful

(1)

See “Derivatives” section below.

Deferred Tax Assets

Our deferred taxes moved to a net asset position as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio resulting from significant increases in period-end market interest rates.

Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Assets

Foreign exchange spot contract assets represent unsettled client trades at the end of the period. The increase of

$31 million

was primarily due to increased client trade activity at period-end, and is consistent with the increase in foreign exchange spot contract liabilities (see “Other Liabilities” section below).



Derivatives

Derivative instruments are recorded as a component of other assets and other liabilities on the balance sheet. The following table provides a summary of derivative assets and liabilities, net at

December 31, 2013

:

Equity Warrant Assets

In connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain rights to acquire stock in the form of equity warrant assets in primarily private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science industries. At

December 31, 2013

, we held warrants in

1,320

companies, compared to

1,270

companies at

December 31, 2012

. The change in fair value of equity warrant assets is recorded in gains on derivatives instruments, net, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. The following table provides a summary of transactions and valuation changes for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


:

Foreign Exchange Forward and Foreign Currency Option Contracts

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts with clients involved in foreign activities, either as the purchaser or seller, depending upon the clients’ need. For each forward or option contract entered into with our clients, we enter into an opposite way forward or option contract with a correspondent bank, which mitigates the risk of fluctuations in currency rates. We also enter into forward contracts with correspondent banks to economically reduce our foreign exchange exposure related to certain foreign currency denominated instruments. Revaluations of foreign currency denominated instruments are recorded on the line item “Other” as part of noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. We have not experienced nonperformance by a counterparty and therefore have not incurred any related losses. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties. Our net exposure for foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts at

December 31, 2013

and


amounted to

$2.9 million

and

$0.7 million

, respectively. For additional information on our foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, see Note 12–“Derivative Financial Instruments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Interest Rate Swaps

Deposits

The following table presents the composition of our deposits as of

December 31, 2013

,


, and


:

The increase in deposits of

$3.3 billion

in


was primarily driven by increases in our noninterest-bearing demand  and money market deposits of

$2.0 billion

and $1.4 billion, respectively, reflective of growth from new clients and strong IPO and M&A activity during the year resulting in increased balances from existing clients. No material portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect our business.

The increase in deposits of

$2.5 billion

in


was primarily driven by increases in our noninterest-bearing demand deposits of

$2.0 billion

, reflective of growth from new clients and the continued lack of attractive market investment opportunities for our deposit clients.

At

December 31, 2013

,

29.3 percent

of our total deposits were interest-bearing deposits, compared to

27.6 percent

at

December 31, 2012

and

29.0 percent

at

December 31, 2011

.

At

December 31, 2013

, the aggregate balance of time deposit accounts individually equal to or greater than $100,000 totaled

$197 million

, compared to

$133 million

at

December 31, 2012

and

$126 million

at

December 31, 2011

. At

December 31, 2013

, substantially all time deposit accounts individually equal to or greater than $100,000 were scheduled to mature within one year. The maturity profile of our time deposits as of

December 31, 2013

is as follows:

Short-Term Borrowings

The following table summarizes our short-term borrowings that mature in one month or less:



Average daily balances and maximum month-end balances for our short-term borrowings in

Long-Term Debt

The following table represents outstanding long-term debt at

December 31, 2013

,


and


:

The decrease of

$3 million

in our long-term debt in


was primarily due to a decrease in the value of the hedge associated with our 6.05% Subordinated Notes. The decrease in our long-term debt in


was primarily due to the maturity of $141 million of our 5.70% Senior Notes on June 1, 2012.

For more information on our long-term debt, please refer to Note 11–“Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 in this report.



Other Liabilities

A summary of other liabilities at

December 31, 2013

and


is as follows:

(1)

See “Derivatives” section above.

Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Liabilities

Foreign exchange spot contract liabilities represent unsettled client trades at the end of the period. The increase of

$33 million

was primarily due to increased client trade activity at period-end, and is consistent with the increase in foreign exchange spot contract assets. (See “Accrued Interest Receivable and Other Assets” section above).

Accrued Compensation

Accrued compensation includes amounts for our Incentive Compensation Plans, Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan, Retention Program, Warrant Incentive Plan, ESOP/profit sharing and other compensation arrangements. The increase of

$23 million

was primarily the result of larger incentive compensation accruals at December 31, 2013 due to our strong performance in 2013. For a description of our variable compensation plans please refer to Note 15—“Employee Compensation and Benefit Plans” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 in this report.

Net Deferred Tax Liabilities

Our deferred taxes moved to a net asset position as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio resulting from significant increases in period-end market interest rates. See "Other Assets" above.

Reserve for Unfunded Credit Commitments

Our reserve for unfunded credit commitments increased to

$30 million

at December 31, 2013, compared to $22 million   at December 31, 2012, due to a

$2.9 billion

increase in unfunded credit commitments during 2013.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests totaled

$1.1 billion

and

$0.8 billion

at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively. The increase of

$0.3 billion

was primarily due to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of

$330 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2013

, primarily related to unrealized gains from FireEye and Twitter and other valuation increases in our managed funds.  For more information, refer to Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Principles of Consolidation and Presentation" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 in this report.



Capital Resources

Our management seeks to maintain adequate capital to support anticipated asset growth, operating needs and unexpected credit risks, and to ensure that SVB Financial and the Bank are in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines. Our primary sources of new capital include retained earnings and proceeds from the sale and issuance of capital stock or other securities. Our management engages, in consultation with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, in a regular capital planning process in an effort to optimize the use of the capital available to us and to appropriately plan for our future capital needs. The capital plan considers capital needs for the foreseeable future and allocates capital to both existing and future business activities. Expected future use or activities for which capital may be set aside include balance sheet growth and associated relative increases in market or credit exposure, investment activity, potential product and business expansions, acquisitions and strategic or infrastructure investments.

SVBFG Stockholders’ Equity

SVBFG stockholders’ equity totaled

$2.0 billion

at

December 31, 2013

, an increase of

$136 million

, or

7.4 percent

compared to

$1.8 billion

at

December 31, 2012

. This increase was primarily the result of net income of

$216 million

in


and an increase in additional-paid-in-capital of

$77 million

primarily from stock option exercises and amortization of share based compensation expense. These increases were offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of

$157 million

primarily as a result of the decline in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio as a result of significant increases in period-end market interest rates.

Funds generated through retained earnings are a significant source of capital and liquidity and are expected to continue to be so in the future.

Capital Ratios

Regulatory capital ratios for SVB Financial and the Bank exceeded minimum federal regulatory guidelines for a well-capitalized depository institution as of

December 31, 2013

,


and


. See Note 19–“Regulatory Matters” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 in this report for further information. Capital ratios for SVB Financial and the Bank, compared to the minimum regulatory ratios to be considered “well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized”, are set forth below:

(1)

Our risk-weighted assets for 2012 reflect a refinement in our determination of certain unfunded credit commitments related to the contractual borrowing base.

(2)

See below for a reconciliation of non-GAAP tangible common equity to tangible assets and tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets.

(3)

The FRB has not issued any minimum guidelines for the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio or the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio. However, we believe these ratios provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our capital levels and are therefore provided above.


compared to




Our total risk-based capital (includes tier 1 and tier 2 capital components) and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios for both SVB Financial and the Bank decreased compared to

December 31, 2012

, reflective of continued growth in risk-weighted assets and  the increase in other comprehensive loss due to the decrease in available-for-sale securities valuations at December 31, 2013, partially offset by growth in retained earnings and additional paid-in-capital.  The growth in risk-weighted assets was primarily due to the significant growth in our loan balances. Our tier 1 leverage ratio for SVB Financial increased compared to

December 31, 2012

due to growth in retained earnings and additional-paid-in-capital, the impact of which was partially offset by continued growth in assets. Our tier 1 leverage ratio for the Bank held relatively flat as our growth in retained earnings matched our growth in assets.  All of our capital ratios are above the levels to be considered “well capitalized”.


compared to


Our total risk-based capital (includes tier 1 and tier 2 capital components) and tier 1 risk-based capital ratios for both SVB Financial and the Bank increased compared to

December 31, 2011

reflective of growth in retained earnings, largely offset by continued growth in risk-weighted assets. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2012, we refined our determination of certain unfunded credit commitments related to the contractual borrowing base, which increased these ratios by approximately 40 basis points. Our tier 1 leverage ratios for both SVB Financial and the Bank increased compared to

December 31, 2011

due to growth in retained earnings and additional-paid-in-capital, the impact of which was partially offset by continued growth in assets. All of our capital ratios are above the levels to be considered “well capitalized”.

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio and the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios are not required by GAAP or applicable bank regulatory requirements. However, we believe these ratios provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our capital levels. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these ratios in evaluating the adequacy of the Company’s capital levels; however, this financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These ratios are calculated by dividing total SVBFG stockholder’s equity, by total period-end assets and risk-weighted assets, after reducing both amounts by acquired intangibles, if any. The manner in which this ratio is calculated varies among companies. Accordingly, our ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar measures of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures defined by GAAP:



(1)

Our risk-weighted assets for 2012 reflect a refinement in our determination of risk rating for certain unfunded credit commitments related to the contractual borrowing base.


compared to


For both SVB Financial and the Bank, the tangible common equity to tangible assets and tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios decreased due to increases in tangible and risk weighted assets. For the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratios, the growth in tangible assets exceeded the growth in equity, which primarily reflects our growth in investment securities and period-end loan balances. For the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios, the growth in risk-weighted assets exceeded the growth in equity, which primarily reflects our growth in period-end loan balances.


compared to


For both SVB Financial and the Bank, the tangible common equity to tangible assets and tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios increased due to an increase in retained earnings, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income from increases in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, and an increase in additional-paid-in-capital from stock option exercises, stock purchases under our ESPP plan, and ESOP contributions during 2012. For the  tangible common equity to tangible assets ratios, the growth in equity was  partially offset by increases in tangible assets, which primarily reflects our growth in deposits. For the  tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios, the growth in equity was  partially offset by increases in risk-weighted assets, which primarily reflects our growth in period-end loan balances.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

In the normal course of business, we use financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial and standby letters of credit and commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity fund investments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. Credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. Please refer to the discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 17-“Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments” of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 in this report.



As of

December 31, 2013

, we, or the funds in which we have an ownership interest and manage, had the following unfunded contractual obligations and commercial commitments:



(1)

See Note 7–“Investment Securities” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 in this report, for further disclosure related to non-marketable and other securities. Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, including the Volcker Rule (See "Business - Supervision and Regulation" under Item 1 of Part I of this report), we make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, which in turn make investments generally in, or in some cases make loans to, privately-held companies . Commitments to invest in these funds are generally made for a


-year period from the inception of the fund. Although the limited partnership agreements governing these investments typically do not restrict the general partners from calling

100%

of committed capital in one year, it is customary for these funds to generally call most of the capital commitments over


to


years; however in certain cases, the funds may not call

100%

of committed capital over the life of the fund. The actual timing of future cash requirements to fund these commitments is generally dependent upon the investment cycle, overall market conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held companies operate.

Liquidity

The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet our financial obligations, including, as necessary, paying creditors, meeting depositors’ needs, accommodating loan demand and growth, funding investments, repurchasing securities and other operating or capital needs, without incurring undue cost or risk, or causing a disruption to normal operating conditions.

We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and economic conditions, individual client funding needs, and existing and planned business activities. Our Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”), which is a management committee, provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines for the approval of the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, and courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity needs.

Our deposit base is, and historically has been, our primary source of liquidity. Our deposit levels and cost of deposits may fluctuate from time to time due to a variety of factors, including market conditions, prevailing interest rates, changes in client deposit behaviors, availability of insurance protection, and our offering of deposit products. At

December 31, 2013

, our period-end total deposit balances increased by

$3.3 billion

to

$22.5 billion

, compared to

$19.2 billion

at

December 31, 2012

. The overall increase in deposit balances was primarily due to the addition of new clients and increased fundraising activity by our venture capital/private equity clients.

Our liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of our portfolio of liquid assets. Our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations, short-term investment securities maturing within one year, available-for-sale securities eligible and available for financing or pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of one year and anticipated near-term cash flows from investments.

On a stand-alone basis, SVB Financial’s primary liquidity channels include dividends from the Bank, its portfolio of liquid assets, and its ability to raise debt and capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is subject to certain regulations described in “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Restriction on Dividends” under Part I, Item 1 in this report.

ITEM 7A.         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk Management

Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse fluctuations in the market value of financial instruments due to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk is our primary market risk and can result from timing and volume differences in the repricing of our rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, widening or tightening of credit spreads, changes in the general level of market interest rates and changes in the shape and level of the benchmark LIBOR/SWAP yield curve. Additionally, changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on mortgage securities, which affects the rate of amortization of purchase premiums and discounts. Other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk. These risks are not considered significant interest rate sensitive risks and no separate quantitative information concerning them is presented herein.

Interest rate risk is managed by our ALCO. ALCO reviews the market valuation and 12-month forward looking earnings sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates, structural changes in investment and funding portfolios, loan and deposit activity and current market conditions. Adherence to relevant policies, which are approved by the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, is monitored on an ongoing basis.

Management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving our available-for-sale securities, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, our policies permit the use of off-balance sheet derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk.

We utilize a simulation model to perform sensitivity analysis on the economic value of equity and net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios, balance sheet forecasts and proposed strategies. The simulation model provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity embedded in our balance sheet which measures the potential variability in forecasted results relating to changes in market interest rates over time. We review our interest rate risk position on a quarterly basis at a minimum.

Model Simulation and Sensitivity Analysis

One application of the aforementioned simulation model involves measurement of the impact of market interest rate changes on our economic value of equity (“EVE”). EVE is defined as the market value of assets, less the market value of liabilities, adjusted for any off-balance sheet items. A second application of the simulation model measures the impact of market interest rate changes on our net interest income (“NII”) assuming a static balance sheet as of the period-end reporting date. The market interest rate changes that affect us are principally short-term interest rates and include the following: (1) National Prime and SVB Prime rates; (2) 1-month and 3-month LIBOR; and (3) Fed Funds target rate. Changes in these short-term rates impact interest earned on our variable rate loans, variable rate available-for-sale securities and balances held as cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, deposit pricing generally follows overall changes in short-term interest rates.

The following table presents our EVE and NII sensitivity exposure at

December 31, 2013

and

December 31, 2012

, related to an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points.



Economic Value of Equity

The estimated EVE in the preceding table is based on a combination of valuation methodologies including a discounted cash flow analysis and a multi-path lattice based valuation. Both methodologies use publicly available market interest rates. The model simulations and calculations are highly assumption-dependent and will change regularly as our asset/liability structure changes, as interest rate environments evolve, and as we change our assumptions in response to relevant market or business circumstances. These calculations do not reflect the changes that we anticipate or may make to reduce our EVE exposure in response to a change in market interest rates as a part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy.

As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain limitations are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding table. We are exposed to yield curve risk, prepayment risk and basis risk, which cannot be fully modeled and expressed using the above methodology. Accordingly, the results in the preceding table should not be relied upon as a precise indicator of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates. Additionally, the resulting EVE and NII estimates are not intended to represent, and should not be construed to represent the underlying value. In addition, we assume different rates of deposit balance decreases for each interest rate scenario based on a long-term historical deposit study of our clients.

Our base case EVE at

December 31, 2013

increased from

December 31, 2012

by

$1.3 billion

primarily due to the change in balance sheet mix and a steeper yield curve due to market condition. The steeper market curve had a $620 million positive impact on the EVE. The change in balance sheet mix was primarily reflective of a $2.0 billion increase in our period-end loan portfolio, a $1.1 billion increase in investment securities and a $530 million increase in cash and cash equivalents.  The increases were offset by an increase of $3.3 billion in deposits. EVE sensitivity slightly increased in the simulated upward interest rate movements due to a $2.0 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. In the simulated downward interest rate movements, EVE sensitivity decreased due to steeper and higher market yield curves. The higher yield curve had a bigger reduction impact on noninterest-bearing deposits, which more than offset the asset value increase from the down rate scenarios.

12-Month Net Interest Income Simulation

Our estimated 12-month NII at

December 31, 2013

increased from

December 31, 2012

by

$132 million

primarily due to an increase of

$2.0 billion

in our loan portfolio which is partially offset by an increase of $1.3 billion in interest-bearing deposits. NII sensitivity stays relatively unchanged in the simulated upward interest rate movements while NII sensitivity decreased in the simulated downward interest rate movements. The NII sensitivity decreased in the simulated downward rate movements due to a lower short-end market yield curve, which reduced the negative impact of rate reset from the variable rate assets.

The simulation model used in the above analysis embeds floors in our interest rate scenarios, which prevent model benchmark rates from moving below 0.0%. In addition, we assume different deposit balance decay rates for each interest rate scenario based on a long-term historical deposit study of our clients. These assumptions may change in future periods based on management discretion. Actual changes in our deposit pricing strategies may differ from our current model assumptions and may have an impact on our overall sensitivity.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

SVB Financial Group:

We have audited SVB Financial Group and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (Item 9A(b)). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, and our report dated February 27, 2014  expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates may change as new information is obtained. Significant items that are subject to such estimates include measurements of fair value, the valuation of non-marketable and other securities, the valuation of equity warrant assets, the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded credit commitments and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The following discussion provides additional background on our significant accounting policies.

Principles of Consolidation and Presentation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SVB Financial Group and entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity and whether the accounting guidance requires consolidation. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Company’s determination of whether it has a controlling interest is based on ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity interest or through control of management of the entities.

VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in a VIE by considering whether our involvement with the VIE is significant and whether we are the primary beneficiary based on the following:

1.

We have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance;



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

2.

The aggregate indirect and direct variable interests held by the Company have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the VIE; and,

3.

Qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size, and form of our involvement with the VIE.

Voting interest entities in which we have a controlling financial interest or VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary are consolidated into our financial statements.

We have not provided financial or other support during the periods presented to any VIE that we were not previously contractually required to provide. We are variable interest holders in certain partnerships for which we are the primary beneficiary. We perform on-going reassessments on the status of the entities and whether facts or circumstances have changed in relation to previously evaluated voting interest entities and our involvement in VIEs which could cause our consolidation conclusion to change.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, cash balances due from banks, interest-earning deposits, Federal Reserve deposits, federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and other short-term investment securities. For the consolidated statements of cash flows, we consider cash equivalents to be investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, so near to their maturity that they present an insignificant risk of change in fair value due to changes in market interest rates, and purchased in conjunction with our cash management activities.

Investment Securities

Available-for-Sale Securities

Our available-for-sale securities portfolio is a fixed income investment portfolio that is managed to earn an appropriate portfolio yield over the long-term while maintaining sufficient liquidity and credit diversification as well as addressing our asset/liability management objectives. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of applicable taxes, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of SVBFG's stockholders' equity, until realized.

We analyze available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment each quarter. Market valuations represent the cumulative current fair value of a security at a specified point in time and incorporates the risk of timing of interest due and the return of principal over the contractual life of each security. Gains and losses on securities are realized when there is a sale of the security prior to maturity. A credit downgrade represents an increased level of risk of other-than-temporary impairment, and as a part of our consideration of recording an other-than-temporary impairment we will assess the issuer's ability to service the debt and to repay the principal at contractual maturity.

We apply the other-than-temporary impairment standards of ASC 320,

Investments-Debt and Equity Securities

. For our debt securities, we have the intent and ability to hold these securities until we recover our cost less any credit-related loss. We separate the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment, if any, into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between a security's amortized cost basis and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the security's effective interest rate. The amount due to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income.

We consider numerous factors in determining whether a credit loss exists and the period over which the debt security is expected to recover. The following list is not meant to be all inclusive. All of the following factors are considered:

•

The length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis (severity and duration);

•

Adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or geographic area; for example, changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset-backed debt security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors. Examples of those changes include any of the following:

◦

Changes in technology;

◦

The discontinuance of a segment of the business that may affect the future earnings potential of the issuer or underlying loan obligors of the security; and

◦

Changes in the quality of the credit enhancement.

•

The historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security;



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

•

The payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future;

•

Failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments;

•

Any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; and

•

Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.

In accordance with ASC 310-20,

Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs

, we use estimates of future principal prepayments, provided by third-party market-data vendors, in addition to actual principal prepayment experience to calculate the constant effective yield necessary to apply the effective interest method in the amortization of purchase discounts or premiums on mortgage-backed securities and fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”). The discounts or premiums are included in interest income over the contractual terms of the underlying securities replicating the effective interest method.

Non-Marketable and Other Securities

Non-marketable and other securities include investments in venture capital and private equity funds, debt funds, direct equity investments in companies and low income housing tax credit funds. A majority of these investments are managed through our SVB Capital funds business in funds of funds and direct venture funds. Our accounting for investments in non-marketable and other securities depends on several factors, including the level of ownership, power to control and the legal structure of the subsidiary making the investment. As further described below, we base our accounting for such securities on: (i) fair value accounting, (ii) equity method accounting, or (iii) cost method accounting.

Fair Value Accounting

Our managed funds are investment companies under the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and accordingly, these funds report their investments at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as investment gains or losses in our consolidated statements of income. Our non-marketable and other securities recorded pursuant to fair value accounting consist of our investments through the following funds:

•

Funds of funds; which make investments in venture capital and private equity funds;

•

Direct venture funds; which make equity investments in privately held companies.

A summary of our ownership interests in the investments held under fair value accounting as of December 31, 2013 is presented in the following table:



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

The general partners of these funds are owned and controlled by SVB Financial. The limited partners of these funds do not have substantive participating or kick-out rights. Therefore, these funds are consolidated and any gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in our consolidated net income.

Under fair value accounting, investments are carried at their estimated fair value based on financial information obtained as the general partner of the fund or obtained from the funds' respective general partner. For direct private company investments, valuations are based upon consideration of a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, exit strategies, and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment.  For direct equity investments in public companies, valuations are based on quoted market prices less a discount if the securities are subject to certain sales restrictions. Sales restriction discounts generally range from

10%

to

20%

depending on the duration of the sale restrictions which typically range from


to


months. For our fund investments, we utilize the net asset value per share as obtained from the general partners of the fund investments as the funds do not have a readily determinable fair value and the funds prepare their financial statements using guidance consistent with fair value accounting. We account for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment's net asset value by using the most recent available financial information from the investee general partner, for example September 30th, for our December 31st consolidated financial statements, adjusted for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and known significant fund transactions or market events about which we are aware through information provided by the fund managers or from publicly available transaction data during the reporting period.

Gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the investments and from distributions received are recorded as gains on investment securities, net, a component of noninterest income. The portion of any investment gains or losses attributable to the limited partners is reflected as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and adjusts our net income to reflect its percentage ownership.

Equity Method

Our equity method non-marketable securities consist of investments in venture capital and private equity funds, privately-held companies, debt funds, and low income housing tax credit funds. Our equity method non-marketable securities and related accounting policies are described as follows:

•

Equity securities, such as preferred or common stock in privately-held companies in which we hold a voting interest of at least

20 percent

but less than

50 percent

or in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investees' operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method.

•

Investments in limited partnerships in which we hold voting interests of more than

5 percent

, but less than

50 percent

or in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the partnerships' operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method.

•

Our China joint venture partnership, for which we have 50 percent ownership, is accounted for under the equity method.

We recognize our proportionate share of the results of operations of these equity method investees in our results of operations, based on the most current financial information available from the investee. We review our investments accounted for under the equity method at least quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. Our review typically includes an analysis of facts and circumstances for each investment, the expectations of the investment's future cash flows and capital needs, variability of its business and the company's exit strategy. For our fund investments, we utilize the net asset value per share as provided by the general partners of the fund investments. We account for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment's net asset value by using the most recent available financial information from the investee general partner, for example September 30

th

, for our December 31

st

consolidated financial statements, adjusted for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and known significant fund transactions or market events about which we are aware through information provided by the fund managers or from publicly available transaction data during the reporting period.

We reduce our investment value when we consider declines in value to be other-than-temporary and recognize the estimated loss as a loss on investment securities, a component of noninterest income.

Cost Method



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Our cost method non-marketable securities and related accounting policies are described as follows:

•

Equity securities, such as preferred or common stock in privately-held companies in which we hold an ownership interest of less than

20 percent

and in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investees' operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the cost method.

•

Investments in limited partnerships in which we hold voting interests of less than

5 percent

and in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the partnerships' operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the cost method. These non-marketable securities include investments in venture capital and private equity funds.

We record these investments at cost and recognize distributions or returns received from net accumulated earnings of the investee since the date of acquisition as income. Our share of net accumulated earnings of the investee after the date of investment are recognized in consolidated net income only to the extent distributed by the investee. Distributions or returns received in excess of accumulated earnings are considered a return of investment and are recorded as reductions in the cost basis of the investment.

We review our investments accounted for under the cost method at least quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. Our review typically includes an analysis of facts and circumstances of each investment, the expectations of the investment's future cash flows and capital needs, variability of its business and the company's exit strategy. To help determine impairment, if any, for our fund investments, we utilize the net asset value per share as provided by the general partners of the fund investments. We account for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment's net asset value by using the most recent available financial information from the investee general partner, for example September 30

th

, for our December 31

st

consolidated financial statements, adjusted for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and known significant fund transactions or market events about which we are aware through information provided by the fund managers or from publicly available transaction data during the reporting period.

We reduce our investment value when we consider declines in value to be other-than-temporary and recognize the estimated loss as a loss on investment securities, a component of noninterest income.

Gains or losses on cost method investment securities that result from a portfolio company being acquired by a publicly traded company are determined using its fair value when the acquisition occurs. The resulting gains or losses are recognized in consolidated net income on that date.

Loans

Loans are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned loan fees. Unearned loan fees reflect unamortized deferred loan origination and commitment fees net of unamortized deferred loan origination costs. In addition to cash loan fees, we often obtain equity warrant assets that give us an option to purchase a position in a client company's stock in consideration for providing credit facilities. The grant date fair values of these equity warrant assets are deemed to be loan fees and are deferred as unearned income and recognized as an adjustment of loan yield through loan interest income. The net amount of unearned loan fees is amortized into loan interest income over the contractual terms of the underlying loans and commitments using the constant effective yield method, adjusted for actual loan prepayment experience, or the straight-line method, as applicable.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses considers credit risk and is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. Our allowance for loan losses is established for estimated loan losses that are probable but not yet realized. Our evaluation process is designed to determine that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate at the balance sheet date. The process of estimating loan losses is inherently imprecise.

We maintain a systematic process for the evaluation of individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses. On a quarterly basis, each loan in our portfolio is assigned a Credit Risk Rating and industry niche. Credit Risk Ratings are assigned on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing loans with a low risk of nonpayment, 9 representing loans with the highest risk of nonpayment, and 10 representing loans which have been charged-off. This Credit Risk Rating process includes, but is not limited to, consideration of such factors as payment status, the financial condition and operating performance of the borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral values and performance trends, the degree of access to additional capital, the presence of credit enhancements such as third party guarantees (where applicable), the degree to which the borrower is sensitive to external factors, the depth and experience of the borrower's management team, potential loan concentrations, and



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

general economic conditions. Our policies require a committee of senior management to review, at least quarterly, credit relationships that exceed specific dollar values. Our review process evaluates the appropriateness of the credit risk rating and allocation of the allowance for loan losses, as well as other account management functions. The allowance for loan losses is based on a formula allocation for similarly risk-rated loans by portfolio segment and individually for impaired loans. The formula allocation provides the average loan loss experience for each portfolio segment, which considers our quarterly historical loss experience since the year 2000, both by risk-rating category and client industry sector. The resulting loan loss factors for each risk-rating category and client industry sector are ultimately applied to the respective period-end client loan balances for each corresponding risk-rating category by client industry sector to provide an estimation of the allowance for loan losses. The probable loan loss experience for any one year period of time is reasonably expected to be greater or less than the average as determined by the loss factors. As such, management applies a qualitative allocation to the results of the aforementioned model to ascertain the total allowance for loan losses. This qualitative allocation is based on management's assessment of the risks that may lead to a future loan loss experience different from our historical loan loss experience. Based on management's prediction or estimate of changing risks in the lending environment, the qualitative allocation may vary significantly from period to period and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of the following factors:

•

Changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collections, and charge-off and recovery practices;

•

Changes in national and local economic business conditions, including the market and economic condition of our clients' industry sectors;

•

Changes in the nature of our loan portfolio;

•

Changes in experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff;

•

Changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans;

•

Changes in the trend of the volume of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, and other loan modifications;

•

Reserve floor for portfolio segments that would not draw a minimum reserve based on the lack of historical loan loss experience;

•

Reserve for large funded loan exposure; and

•

Other factors as determined by management from time to time.

While the evaluation process of our allowance for loan losses uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of the allowance for loan losses rely, to a great extent, on the judgment and experience of our management.

Uncollectible Loans and Write-offs

Our charge-off policy applies to all loans, regardless of portfolio segment. Loans are considered for full or partial charge-offs in the event that principal or interest is over 180 days past due or the loan lacks sufficient collateral and it is not in the process of collection. We also consider writing off loans in the event of any of the following circumstances: 1) the loan, or a portion of the loan is deemed uncollectible due to: a) the borrower's inability to make recurring payments, b) material changes in the borrower's assets, c) the expected sale of all or a portion of the borrower's business, or d) a combination of the foregoing; 2) the loan has been identified for charge-off by regulatory authorities; or 3) the debt is overdue greater than 90 days.

Troubled Debt Restructurings

A TDR arises from the modification of a loan where we have granted a concession to the borrower related to the borrower's financial difficulties that we would not have otherwise considered for economic or legal reasons. These concessions may include: (1) deferral of payment for more than an insignificant period of time; (2) interest rate reductions; (3) extension of the maturity date with interest rate concessions; (4) principal forgiveness; and or (5) reduction of accrued interest.

We use the factors in ASC 310-40,

Receivables, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors,

to help determine when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and when we have granted a concession, both of which must be present for a restructuring to meet the criteria of a TDR. If we determine that a TDR exists, we measure impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, we may



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

also measure impairment based on a loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if the loan is a collateral-dependent loan.

Reserve for Unfunded Credit Commitments

We record a liability for probable and estimable losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments being funded and subsequently being charged off. Each quarter, every unfunded client credit commitment is allocated to a credit risk-rating  in accordance with each client's credit risk rating. We use the historical loan loss factors described under our allowance for loan losses to calculate the loan loss experience if unfunded credit commitments are funded. Separately, we use historical trends to calculate a probability of an unfunded credit commitment being funded. We apply the loan funding probability factor to risk-factor adjusted unfunded credit commitments by credit risk-rating to derive the reserve for unfunded credit commitments, similar to  funded loans. The reserve for unfunded credit commitments also includes certain qualitative allocations as deemed appropriate by our management. We include the reserve for unfunded credit commitments in other liabilities and the related provision in other expenses.

Nonaccrual Loans and Impaired Loans

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due as to principal or interest payments (unless the principal and interest are well secured and in the process of collection); or when we have determined, based upon currently known information, that the timely collection of principal or interest is not probable.

When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued interest and fees are reversed against interest income and the loan is accounted for using the cost recovery method thereafter until qualifying for return to accrual status. Historically, loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status have remained as nonaccrual loans until the loan is either charged-off, or the principal balances have been paid off. For a loan to be returned to accrual status, all delinquent principal and interest must become current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and future collection of remaining principal and interest must be deemed probable. We apply a cost recovery method in which all cash received is applied to the loan principal until it has been collected. Under this approach, interest income is recognized after total cash flows received exceed the recorded investment at the date of initial impairment.

A loan is considered impaired when, based upon currently known information, it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the agreement. All of our nonaccrual loans are classified under the impaired category. On a quarterly basis, we review our loan portfolio for impairment. Within each class of loans, we review individual loans for impairment based on credit risk ratings. Loans that have credit risk ratings of 8 or 9 are considered impaired and are reviewed individually.

For each loan identified as impaired, we measure the impairment based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. In limited circumstances, we may measure impairment based on the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent. Impaired collateral dependent loans will have independent appraisals completed and accepted at least annually. The fair value of the collateral will be determined by the most recent appraisal, as adjusted to reflect a reasonable marketing period for the sale of the asset(s) and an estimate of reasonable selling expenses.

If it is determined that the value of an impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, net of previous charge-offs and payments collected, we recognize impairment through the allowance for loan losses as determined by our analysis.

Standby Letters of Credit

We recognize a liability at the inception of a standby letter of credit equivalent to the premium or the fee received for such guarantee. This fee is recognized in noninterest income over the commitment period using the straight-line method.



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the related leases, whichever is shorter. The maximum estimated useful lives by asset classification are as follows:

We capitalize the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use, including costs related to developed software, purchased software licenses and certain implementation costs.

For property and equipment that is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in noninterest expense in consolidated net income.

Lease Obligations

We lease all of our properties. At the inception of the lease, each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease. For leases that contain rent escalations or landlord incentives, we record the total rent payable during the lease term, using the straight-line method over the term of the lease and record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight-line rent as lease obligations. We had no capitalized lease obligations at

Fair Value Measurements

Our available-for-sale securities, derivative instruments and certain marketable, non-marketable and other securities are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We make estimates regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing our consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurement-Definition and Hierarchy

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There is a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable and the significance of those inputs in the fair value measurement. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data and views of market participants. The three levels for measuring fair value are based on the reliability of inputs and are as follows:

Level 1

Fair value measurements based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these instruments does not entail a significant degree of judgment. Assets utilizing Level 1 inputs include exchange-traded equity securities and certain marketable securities accounted for under fair value accounting.

Level 2

Fair value measurements based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, directly or indirectly. Valuations for the available-for-sale securities are provided by third party external pricing service providers. We review the methodologies used to determine the fair value, including understanding the nature and observability of the inputs used to determine the price. Additional corroboration, such as obtaining a non-binding price from a broker, may be obtained depending on the frequency of trades of the security and the level of liquidity or depth of the market. The valuation methodology that is generally used for the Level 2 assets is the income approach. Below is a summary of the significant inputs used for each class of Level 2 assets and liabilities:



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

U.S. treasury securities:

U.S. treasury securities are considered by most investors to be the most liquid fixed income investments available. These securities are priced relative to market prices on similar U.S. treasury securities.

U.S. agency debentures:

Fair value measurements of U.S. agency debentures are based on the characteristics specific to bonds held, such as issuer name, issuance date, coupon rate, maturity date and any applicable issuer call option features. Valuations are based on market spreads relative to similar term benchmark market interest rates, generally U.S. treasury securities.

Agency-issued mortgage-backed securities:

Agency-issued mortgage-backed securities are pools of individual conventional mortgage loans underwritten to U.S. agency standards with similar coupon rates, tenor, and other attributes such as geographic location, loan size and origination vintage. Fair value measurements of these securities are based on observable price adjustments relative to benchmark market interest rates taking into consideration estimated loan prepayment speeds.

Agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations:

Agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations are structured into classes or tranches with defined cash flow characteristics and are collateralized by U.S. agency-issued mortgage pass-through securities. Fair value measurements of these securities incorporate similar characteristics of mortgage pass-through securities such as coupon rate, tenor, geographic location, loan size and origination vintage, in addition to incorporating the effect of estimated prepayment speeds on the cash flow structure of the class or tranche. These measurements incorporate observable market spreads over an estimated average life after considering the inputs listed above.

Agency-issued commercial mortgage-backed securities:

Fair value measurements of these securities are based on spreads to benchmark market interest rates (usually U.S. treasury rates or rates observable in the swaps market), prepayment speeds, loan default rate assumptions and loan loss severity assumptions on underlying loans.

Municipal bonds and notes:

Bonds issued by municipal governments generally have stated coupon rates, final maturity dates and are subject to being called ahead of the final maturity date at the option of the issuer. Fair value measurements of these securities are priced based on spreads to other municipal benchmark bonds with similar characteristics; or, relative to market rates on U.S. treasury bonds of similar maturity.

Interest rate swap assets:

Fair value measurements of interest rate swaps are priced considering the coupon rate of the fixed leg of the contract and the variable coupon on the floating leg of the contract. Valuation is based on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve and the credit worthiness of the contract counterparty.

Foreign exchange forward and option contract assets and liabilities:

Fair value measurements of these assets and liabilities are priced based on spot and forward foreign currency rates and option volatility assumptions and the credit worthiness of the contract counterparty.

Equity warrant assets (public portfolio):

Fair value measurements of equity warrant assets of publicly-traded portfolio companies are valued based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model uses the price of publicly-traded companies (underlying stock price), stated strike prices, warrant expiration dates, the risk-free interest rate and market-observable option volatility assumptions.

Level 3

The fair value measurement is derived from valuation techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates of assumptions we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset. Below is a summary of the valuation techniques used for each class of Level 3 assets:

Venture capital and private equity fund investments:

Fair value measurements are based on the net asset value per share as obtained from the investee funds' management as the funds do not have a readily determinable fair value and the funds prepare their financial statements using guidance consistent with fair value accounting. We account for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment’s net asset value by using the most recent available financial information from the investee general partner, adjusted for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and significant fund transactions or market events during the reporting period.

Other venture capital investments:

Fair value measurements are based on consideration of a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, and as it relates to the private company, the current and projected operating performance, exit strategies, and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement include the information about each portfolio company, including actual and forecasted results, cash position, recent or planned transactions and market comparable companies. Significant



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

changes to any one of these inputs in isolation could result in a significant change in the fair value measurement, however, we generally consider all factors available through ongoing communication with the portfolio companies and venture capital fund managers to determine whether there are changes to the portfolio company or the environment that indicate a change in the fair value measurement.

Other securities:

Fair value measurements of equity securities of public companies are priced based on quoted market prices less a discount if the securities are subject to certain sales restrictions. Certain sales restriction discounts generally range from

10%

to

20%

depending on the duration of the sale restrictions which typically range from 3 to 6 months.

Equity warrant assets (public portfolio):

Fair value measurements of equity warrant assets of publicly-traded portfolio companies are valued based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model uses the price of publicly-traded companies (underlying stock price), stated strike prices, warrant expiration dates, the risk-free interest rate and market-observable option volatility assumptions. Modeled asset values are further adjusted by applying a discount of up to

20%

for certain warrants that have certain sales restrictions or other features that indicate a discount to fair value is warranted. As sale restrictions are lifted, discounts are adjusted downward to 0 percent once all restrictions expire or are removed.

Equity warrant assets (private portfolio):

Fair value measurements of equity warrant assets of private portfolio companies are priced based on a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the asset value by using stated strike prices, option expiration dates, risk-free interest rates and option volatility assumptions. Option volatility assumptions used in the modified Black-Scholes model are based on public market indices whose members operate in similar industries as companies in our private company portfolio. Option expiration dates are modified to account for estimates to actual life relative to stated expiration. Overall model asset values are further adjusted for a general lack of liquidity due to the private nature of the associated underlying company. There is a direct correlation between changes in the volatility and remaining life assumptions in isolation and the fair value measurement while there is an inverse correlation between changes in the liquidity discount assumption and the fair value measurement.

It is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. When available, we use quoted market prices to measure fair value. If market prices are not available, fair value measurement is based upon valuation techniques that use primarily market-based or independently-sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment speeds, option volatilities and currency rates. Substantially all of our financial instruments use the foregoing methodologies, and are categorized as a Level 1 or Level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. However, in certain cases, when market observable inputs for our valuation techniques may not be readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions we believe market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument, and based on the significance of those judgments, the measurement may be determined to be a Level 3 fair value measurement.

The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. For inactive markets, there is little information, if any, to evaluate if individual transactions are orderly. Accordingly, we are required to estimate, based upon all available facts and circumstances, the degree to which orderly transactions are occurring and provide more weighting to price quotes that are based upon orderly transactions. In addition, changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greater for financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3.

Fee-based Services Revenue Recognition

Letters of Credit and Standby Letters of Credit Fee Income

Fees generated from letters of credit and standby letters of credit are deferred as a component of other liabilities and recognized in noninterest income over the commitment period using the straight-line method, based on the likelihood that the commitment being drawn down will be remote.



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Client Investment Fees

Client investment fees include fees earned from Rule 12(b)-1 fees, revenue sharing and from customer transactional based fees. Rule 12(b)-1 fees and revenue sharing are recognized as earned based on client funds that are invested in the period. Transactional based fees are earned and recognized on fixed income and equity securities when the transaction is executed on the clients' behalf.

Foreign Exchange Fees

Foreign exchange fees represent the income differential between purchases and sales of foreign currency on behalf of our clients and are recognized as earned.

Lending Related Fees

Unused commitment fees, minimum finance fees and unused line fees are recognized as earned on a monthly and quarterly basis.  Fees that qualify for syndication treatment are recognized at the completion of the syndicated loan deal for which the fees were received.

Other Fee Income

Credit card fees and deposit service charge fee income are recognized as earned on a monthly basis.

Other Service Revenue

Other service revenue primarily includes revenue from valuation services. We recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) we have performed the service, provided we have no other remaining obligations to the customer, (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable and, (iv) collectibility is probable.

Fund Management Fees and Carried Interest

Fund management fees are comprised of fees charged directly to our managed funds of funds and direct venture funds. Fund management fees are based upon the contractual terms of the limited partnership agreements and are recognized as earned over the specified contract period, which is generally equal to the life of the individual fund.  Fund management fees are recorded as a component of other noninterest income.

Carried interest is comprised of preferential allocations of profits recognizable when the return on assets of our individual managed funds of funds and direct venture funds exceeds certain performance targets. Carried interest is recorded quarterly based on measuring fund performance to date versus the performance target and is recorded as a component of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Our federal, state and foreign income tax provisions are based upon taxes payable for the current year as well as current year changes in deferred taxes related to temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement balances of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. We file a consolidated federal income tax return, and consolidated, combined, or separate state income tax returns as appropriate. Our foreign incorporated subsidiaries file tax returns in the applicable foreign jurisdictions. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other noninterest expense, a component of consolidated net income.

Share-Based Compensation

For all stock-based awards granted, stock-based compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, including consideration of vesting conditions and anticipated forfeitures. The fair value of stock options are measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common stock shares and potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of stock options, ESPP shares and restricted stock units. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if the effect is antidilutive.

Derivative Financial Instruments

All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative financial instrument depends on whether the derivative financial instrument is designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity. Changes in fair value are recognized through earnings for derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, or that have not been designated in a hedging relationship.

Fair Value Hedges

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in the statement of income in the same line item as the hedged item and is intended to offset the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Any difference that does arise would be the result of hedge ineffectiveness, and impacts earnings.

Equity Warrant Assets

In connection with negotiated credit facilities and certain other services, we may obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock in primarily private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science industries. We hold these assets for prospective investment gains. We do not use them to hedge any economic risks nor do we use other derivative instruments to hedge economic risks stemming from equity warrant assets.

We account for equity warrant assets in certain private and public client companies as derivatives when they contain net settlement terms and other qualifying criteria under ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

. In general, equity warrant assets entitle us to buy a specific number of shares of stock at a specific price within a specific time period. Certain equity warrant assets contain contingent provisions, which adjust the underlying number of shares or purchase price upon the occurrence of certain future events. Our warrant agreements typically contain net share settlement provisions, which permit us to receive at exercise a share count equal to the intrinsic value of the warrant divided by the share price (otherwise known as a “cashless” exercise). These equity warrant assets are recorded at fair value and are classified as derivative assets, a component of other assets, on our consolidated balance sheet at the time they are obtained.

The grant date fair values of equity warrant assets received in connection with the issuance of a credit facility are deemed to be loan fees and recognized as an adjustment of loan yield through loan interest income. Similar to other loan fees, the yield adjustment related to grant date fair value of warrants is recognized over the life of that credit facility.

Any changes in fair value from the grant date fair value of equity warrant assets will be recognized as increases or decreases to other assets on our balance sheet and as net gains or losses on derivative investments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. When a portfolio company completes an IPO on a publicly reported market or is acquired, we may exercise these equity warrant assets for shares or cash.

In the event of an exercise for shares, the basis or value in the securities is reclassified from other assets to investment securities on the balance sheet on the latter of the exercise date or corporate action date. The shares in public companies are classified as available-for-sale securities (provided they do not have a significant restriction from sale). Changes in fair value of securities designated as available-for-sale, after applicable taxes, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of SVBFG stockholders' equity. The shares in private companies are classified as non-marketable securities. We, typically, account for these securities at cost and only record adjustments to the value at the time of exit or liquidation though gains (losses) on investments securities, net, which is a component of noninterest income.

The fair value of the equity warrant assets portfolio is reviewed quarterly. We value our equity warrant assets using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model, which incorporates the following significant inputs:

•

An underlying asset value, which is estimated based on current information available, including any information regarding subsequent rounds of funding.



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

•

Stated strike price, which can be adjusted for certain warrants upon the occurrence of subsequent funding rounds or other future events.

•

Price volatility or the amount of uncertainty or risk about the magnitude of the changes in the warrant price. The volatility assumption is based on historical price volatility of publicly traded companies within indices similar in nature to the underlying client companies issuing the warrant. The actual volatility input is based on the median volatility for an individual public company within an index for the past 16 quarters, from which an average volatility was derived.

•

Actual data on cancellations and exercises of our warrants are utilized as the basis for determining the expected remaining life of the warrants in each financial reporting period. Warrants may be exercised in the event of acquisitions, mergers or IPOs, and cancelled due to events such as bankruptcies, restructuring activities or additional financings. These events cause the expected remaining life assumption to be shorter than the contractual term of the warrants.

•

The risk-free interest rate is derived from the Treasury yield curve and is calculated based on a weighted average of the risk-free interest rates that correspond closest to the expected remaining life of the warrant.

•

Other adjustments, including a marketability discount, are estimated based on management's judgment about the general industry environment.

Loan Conversion Options

In connection with negotiating certain credit facilities, we occasionally extend loan facilities, which have convertible option features. The convertible loans may be converted into a certain number of shares determined by dividing the principal amount of the loan by the applicable conversion price. Because our loan conversion options have underlying and notional values, had no initial net investment and met other qualifying criteria under ASC 815, these assets qualify as derivative instruments. We value our loan conversion options using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model, which incorporates assumptions about the underlying asset value, volatility, and the risk-free rate. Loan conversion options are recorded at fair value in other assets, while changes in their fair value are recorded through gains on derivative instruments, net, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.

Foreign Exchange Forwards and Foreign Currency Option Contracts

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts with clients involved in international activities, either as the purchaser or seller, depending upon the clients' need. We typically also enter into an opposite-way forward or option contract with a correspondent bank to economically hedge client contracts to mitigate the fair value risk to us from fluctuations in currency rates. Settlement, credit, and operational risks remain. We also enter into forward contracts with correspondent banks to economically hedge currency exposure risk related to certain foreign currency denominated loans. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized in consolidated net income under gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net, a component of noninterest income. Period-end gross positive fair values are recorded in other assets and gross negative fair values are recorded in other liabilities.

Impact of Adopting ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income

In June 2011, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, which requires presentation of the components of total comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. Regardless of which option is chosen, reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income are required to be shown on the face of the financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB approved a proposed update, which indefinitely defers the requirements of ASU No. 2011-05 to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement. This new guidance did not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The guidance was effective on a retrospective basis for the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and was therefore adopted effective January 1, 2012. This standard only clarified the presentation of comprehensive income and did not affect our financial position, results of operations or stockholders’ equity.

Impact of Adopting ASU No. 2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities

In December 2011, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, which requires new disclosures surrounding derivative instruments and certain financial instruments that are offset on the statement of financial position, or are eligible for offset



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

subject to a master netting arrangement. This standard was issued concurrent with the IASB’s issuance of a similar standard with the objective of converged disclosure guidance. The guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for the interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and was therefore adopted in the first quarter of 2013. The standard increased the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and certain financial instruments that are subject to master netting arrangements, and did not have any impact on our financial position, results of operations or stockholders' equity. See Note 12 - “Derivative Financial Instruments” for further details.

Impact of Adopting ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

In February 2013, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, which requires new disclosures surrounding the effect of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. This standard requires entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and by the respective line items of net income. The guidance was effective on a prospective basis for the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2013, and was therefore adopted in the first quarter of 2013. This standard increased the disclosure requirements for reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income, and did not have any impact on our financial position, results of operations or stockholders’ equity. See our "Interim Consolidated Statements of Income" for more details.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU 2013-08,

Financial Services - Investment Companies (ASC Topic 946): Amendments to the Scope, Measurement and Disclosure Requirement).

This ASU modifies the guidance in ASC 946 for determining whether an entity is an investment company, as well as the measurement and disclosure requirements for investment companies. The ASU does not change current accounting where a noninvestment company parent retains the specialized accounting applied by an investment company subsidiary in consolidation. ASU 2013-08 will be applied prospectively for all periods beginning after December 15, 2013. We do not expect this ASU to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.

In January 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard (ASU 2014-01,

Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (topic 323), Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects

), which permits entities that invest in qualified affordable housing projects through limited liability entities that are flow-through entities for tax purposes to make an accounting policy election to use proportional amortization method or apply an equity or cost method.  If the proportional amortization method is elected, retrospective presentation is required for prior periods.  The guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, with early adoption available.  We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance, however, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or stockholders' equity.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentations.

Stockholders’ Equity and EPS

Stockholders' Rights Plan

Our Board of Directors (the “Board”)  had previously adopted a stockholders' rights plan (the "Rights Plan") to, among other things, protect our stockholders from coercive takeover tactics. The Rights Plan expired on January 31, 2014.  It was not renewed or extended by our Board of Directors.

EPS

Basic EPS is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for stock options and restricted stock units outstanding under our equity incentive plans and our ESPP. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of dilutive EPS in periods in which the effect would be antidilutive. The following is a reconciliation of basic EPS to diluted EPS for

Concurrent with the issuance of our 3.875% convertible senior notes ("3.875% Convertible Notes"), we entered into a convertible note hedge and warrant agreement. The warrants expired ratably over


business days beginning on July 15, 2011. The common shares under these warrants were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation for all periods presented as they were deemed to be anti-dilutive based on the conversion price of

$64.43

per common share.

Our

$250 million

3.875% Convertible Notes matured on

April 15, 2011

. All of the notes were converted prior to maturity and we made an aggregate

$260 million

conversion settlement payment. We paid

$250 million

in cash (representing total principal) and

$10 million

through the issuance of

187,760

shares of our common stock (representing total conversion premium value). In addition, in connection with the conversion settlement, we received

186,736

shares of our common stock, valued at

$10 million

, from the associated convertible note hedge. Accordingly, there was not a significant impact on our total stockholders' equity with respect to settling the conversion premium value.

Equity Incentive Plans

On May 11, 2006, our stockholders approved the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Incentive Plan”). Our previous 1997 Equity Incentive Plan expired in December 2006. The 2006 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of various types of incentive awards, of which the following have been granted: (i) stock options; (ii) restricted stock awards; (iii) restricted stock units; and (iv) other cash or stock settled equity awards.

Subject to the provisions of Section 16 of the 2006 Incentive Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be awarded and sold thereunder is

7,543,321

, which includes

2,000,000

shares that are subject to stockholder approval at the upcoming 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units will be counted against the numerical limits of the 2006 Incentive Plan as two shares for every one share awarded. Further, if shares acquired under any such award are forfeited or repurchased by us and would otherwise return to the 2006 Incentive Plan, two times the number of such forfeited or repurchased shares will return to the 2006 Incentive Plan and will again become available for issuance.

Eligible participants in the 2006 Incentive Plan include directors, employees, and consultants. Options granted under the 2006 Incentive Plan generally expire

seven

years after the grant date. Options generally become exercisable over various periods, typically

four

years, from the grant date based on continued employment, and typically vest annually. Restricted stock awards and units generally vest over the passage of time and require continued employment or other service through the vesting period. Performance-based restricted stock units generally vest upon meeting certain performance-based objectives and, typically the passage of time and require continued employment or other service through the vesting period. The vesting period for restricted stock units cannot be less than

three

years unless they are subject to certain performance-based objectives, in which case the vesting period can be


months or longer.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We maintain the 1999 ESPP under which participating employees may annually contribute up to

10 percent

of their gross compensation (not to exceed

$25,000

) to purchase shares of our common stock at

85 percent

of its fair market value at either the beginning or end of each six-month offering period, whichever price is less. To be eligible to participate in the ESPP, an employee must, among other requirements, be employed by the Company on both the date of offering and date of purchase, and be employed customarily for at least 20 hours per week and at least five months per calendar year. We issued

176,416

shares and received

$9.8 million

in cash under the ESPP in


. At

December 31, 2013

, a total of

696,309

shares of our common stock were still available for future issuance under the ESPP.

Valuation Assumptions

The fair values of share-based awards for employee stock options and employee stock purchases made under our ESPP were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of restricted stock units were based on our closing stock price on the date of grant. The following weighted average assumptions and fair values were used for our employee stock options and restricted stock units:

The following weighted average assumptions and fair values were used for our ESPP:

The expected term is based on the implied term of the stock options using factors based on historical exercise behavior. The expected volatilities are based on a blended rate consisting of our historic volatility and our expected volatility over a

five

-year term which is an indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends. For


,


and


, expected volatilities for the ESPP were equal to the historical volatility for the previous six-month periods. The expected risk-free interest rates were based on the yields of Treasury Securities, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with maturities equal to the expected terms of the employee stock options.

. The weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of debt securities, which are reported at fair value. For U.S. treasury securities, the expected maturity is the actual contractual maturity of the notes. Expected remaining maturities for certain U.S. agency debentures may occur earlier than their contractual maturities because the note issuers have the right to call outstanding amounts ahead of their contractual maturity. Expected maturities for mortgage-backed securities may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay outstanding loan obligations with or without penalties. Mortgage-backed securities classified as available-for-sale typically have original contractual maturities from


to


years whereas expected average lives of these securities tend to be significantly shorter and vary based upon structure and prepayments in lower rate environments.

Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses

We serve a variety of commercial clients in the technology, life science, venture capital/private equity and premium wine industries. Our technology clients generally tend to be in the industries of hardware (semiconductors, communications and electronics), software and related services, and clean technology (energy and resource innovation). Because of the diverse nature of clean technology products and services, for our loan-related reporting purposes, cleantech-related loans are reported under our hardware, software, life science and other commercial loan categories, as applicable. Our life science clients are concentrated in the medical devices and biotechnology sectors. Loans made to venture capital/private equity firm clients typically enable them to fund investments prior to their receipt of funds from capital calls. Loans to the premium wine industry focus on vineyards and wineries that produce grapes and wines of high quality.

In addition to commercial loans, we make consumer loans through SVB Private Bank and provide real estate secured loans to eligible employees through our EHOP. Our private banking clients are primarily venture capital/private equity professionals and executive leaders in the innovation companies they support. These products and services include real estate secured home equity lines of credit, which may be used to finance real estate investments and loans used to purchase, renovate or refinance personal residences. These products and services also include restricted stock purchase loans and capital call lines of credit.

We also provide community development loans made as part of our responsibilities under the Community Reinvestment Act. These loans are included within “Construction loans” below and are primarily secured by real estate.

Credit Quality Indicators

For each individual client, we establish an internal credit risk rating for that loan, which is used for assessing and monitoring credit risk as well as performance of the loan and the overall portfolio. Our internal credit risk ratings are also used to summarize the risk of loss due to failure by an individual borrower to repay the loan. For our internal credit risk ratings, each individual loan is given a risk rating of 1 through 10. Loans risk-rated 1 through 4 are performing loans and translate to an internal rating of “Pass”, with loans risk-rated 1 being cash secured. Loans risk-rated 5 through 7 are performing loans, however, we consider them as demonstrating higher risk, which requires more frequent review of the individual exposures; these translate to an internal rating of “Performing (Criticized)”. A majority of our Performing (Criticized) loans are from our SVB Accelerator practice, serving our emerging or early stage clients. Loans risk-rated 8 and 9 are loans that are considered to be impaired and are on nonaccrual status. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due as to principal or interest payments (unless the principal and interest are well secured and in the process of collection), or when we have determined, based upon most recent available information, that the timely collection of principal or interest is not probable; these loans are deemed “impaired” (For further description of nonaccrual loans, refer to Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”). Loans rated 10 are charged-off and are not included as part of our loan portfolio balance. We review our credit quality indicators for performance and appropriateness of risk ratings as part of our evaluation process for our allowance for loan losses.

TDRs

As of

December 31, 2013

we had 18 TDRs with a total carrying value of

$22 million

where concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, in an attempt to maximize collection. This compares to 18 TDRs with a total carrying value of

$34 million

as of

December 31, 2012

. There were unfunded commitments available for funding of

$0.1 million

to the clients associated with these TDRs as of

$11.1 million

,

$14.3 million

, and

$2.8 million

respectively, on loans classified as TDRs.

During


and 2011 all new TDRs were modified through payment deferrals granted to our clients and no principal or interest was forgiven.  During


new TDRs totaling

$9 million

and

$19 million

were modified through forgiveness of principal and payment deferrals granted to our clients, respectively.

The related allowance for loan losses for the majority of our TDRs is determined on an individual basis by comparing the carrying value of the loan to the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the pre-modification contractual


interest rate. For certain TDRs, the related allowance for loan losses is determined based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

The following table summarizes the recorded investment in loans modified in TDRs within the previous 12 months that subsequently defaulted during their respective periods, broken out by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable:

Charge-offs and defaults on previously restructured loans are evaluated to determine the impact to the allowance for loan losses, if any. The evaluation of these defaults may impact the assumptions used in calculating the reserve on other TDRs and impaired loans as well as management’s overall outlook of macroeconomic factors that affect the reserve on the loan portfolio as a whole. After evaluating the charge-offs and defaults experienced on our TDRs we determined that no change to our reserving methodology was necessary to determine the allowance for loan losses as of

December 31, 2013

.

5.375% Senior Notes

In September 2010, we issued

$350 million

of 5.375% Senior Notes due in September 2020 (“5.375% Senior Notes”). We received net proceeds of

$345 million

after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses. We used approximately

$250 million

of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to meet obligations due on our 3.875% Convertible Notes, which matured in April 2011. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital.

6.05%

Subordinated Notes

On May 15, 2007, the Bank issued 6.05% Subordinated Notes, due in

June 2017

, in an aggregate principal amount of

$250 million

.  Concurrent with the issuance of the 6.05% Subordinated Notes, we entered into a fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreement (see Note 12-“Derivative Financial Instruments”).

We repurchased

$204 million

of our 6.05% Subordinated Notes through a tender offer transaction in May 2011. The repurchase resulted in a gross loss from extinguishment of debt. In connection with the repurchase, we terminated the corresponding amount of the interest rate swap associated with the 6.05% Subordinated Notes (see Note 12-“Derivative Financial Instruments”), resulting in a gross gain on swap termination. The net gain from the note repurchase and the termination of the corresponding portion of the interest rate swap was recognized during the second quarter of 2011 as a reduction in noninterest expense, which is included in the line item “Other”.

7.0% Junior Subordinated Debentures

In October 2003, we issued

$50 million

in 7.0% Junior Subordinated Debentures to a special-purpose trust, SVB Capital II. Distributions to SVB Capital II are cumulative and are payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 7.0 percent per annum of the face value of the junior subordinated debentures. Distributions for each of

were

$3.5 million

. The junior subordinated debentures are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity in October 2033, or may be redeemed prior to maturity in whole or in part, at our option, at any time on or after October 2008. Issuance costs of

$2.2 million

related to the junior subordinated debentures were deferred and are being amortized over the period until mandatory redemption of the debentures in October 2033.

Available Lines of Credit

We have certain facilities in place to enable us to access short-term borrowings on a secured (using available-for-sale securities as collateral) and an unsecured basis. These include repurchase agreements and uncommitted federal funds lines with various financial institutions. As of

December 31, 2013

, we did not borrow against our uncommitted federal funds lines. We also pledge securities to the FHLB of San Francisco and the discount window at the FRB. The market value of collateral pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco (comprised primarily of U.S. agency debentures) at

December 31, 2013

December 31, 2013

totaled

$578 million

, all of which was unused and available to support additional borrowings.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We primarily use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. Also, in connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock in private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science industries.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is our primary market risk and can result from timing and volume differences in the repricing of our interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities and changes in market interest rates.

To manage interest rate risk for our 6.05% Subordinated Notes, we entered into a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreement at the time of debt issuance based upon LIBOR with matched-terms.

Net cash benefits associated with our interest rate swap is recorded as a reduction in “Interest expense—Borrowings,” a component of net interest income. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is calculated using a discounted cash flow method and adjusted for credit valuation associated with counterparty risk. Changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are reflected in either other assets (for swaps in an asset position) or other liabilities (for swaps in a liability position).

We assess hedge effectiveness under ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, using the long-haul method. Any differences associated with our interest rate swaps that arise as a result of hedge ineffectiveness are recorded through net gains on derivative instruments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.

Currency Exchange Risk

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to economically reduce our foreign exchange exposure risk associated with the net difference between foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily in Pound Sterling and Euro. We do not designate any foreign exchange forward contracts as derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in currency rates on foreign currency denominated instruments are included in other noninterest income, a component of noninterest income. We may experience ineffectiveness in the economic hedging relationship, because the instruments are revalued based upon changes in the currency’s spot rate on the principal value, while the forwards are revalued on a discounted cash flow basis. We record forward agreements in gain positions in other assets and loss positions in other liabilities, while net changes in fair value are recorded through net gains on derivative instruments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. Additionally, through our global banking operations we maintain customer deposits denominated in the Euro and Pound Sterling, which are used to fund certain loans in these currencies to limit our exposure to currency fluctuations.

Other Derivative Instruments

Equity Warrant Assets

Our equity warrant assets are concentrated in private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science industries. Most of these warrant agreements contain net share settlement provisions, which permit us to pay the warrant exercise price using shares issuable under the warrant (“cashless exercise”). We value our equity warrant assets using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model, which incorporates assumptions about the underlying asset value, volatility, and the risk-free rate. We make valuation adjustments for estimated remaining life and marketability for warrants issued by private companies. Equity warrant assets are recorded at fair value in other assets, while changes in their fair value are recorded through net gains on derivative instruments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.

Loan Conversion Options

In connection with negotiating certain credit facilities, we occasionally extend loan facilities which have convertible option features. The convertible loans may be converted into a certain number of shares determined by dividing the principal amount of the loan by the applicable conversion price. Because our loan conversion options have underlying and notional values and had no initial net investment, these assets qualify as derivative instruments. We value our loan conversion options using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model, which incorporates assumptions about the underlying asset value, volatility, and the risk-free rate. Loan conversion options are recorded at fair value in other assets, while changes in their fair value are recorded through net gains on derivative instruments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Other Derivatives

We sell forward and option contracts to clients who wish to mitigate their foreign currency exposure. We economically reduce the currency risk from this business by entering into opposite way contracts with correspondent banks. This relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. The contracts generally have terms of

one year

or less, although we may have contracts extending for up to

five years

. Generally, we have not experienced nonperformance on these contracts, have not incurred credit losses, and anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. Contracts in an asset position are included in other assets and contracts in a liability position are included in other liabilities. The net change in the fair value of these contracts is recorded through net gains on derivative instruments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.

Counterparty Credit Risk

We are exposed to credit risk if counterparties to our derivative contracts do not perform as expected. We mitigate counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures and obtaining collateral, as appropriate. With respect to measuring counterparty credit risk for derivative instruments, we measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on a net risk basis by counterparty portfolio.

We are subject to income tax in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions and have identified our federal tax return and tax returns in California and Massachusetts as “major” tax filings. U.S. federal tax examinations through 2009 have been concluded.

Our U.S. federal tax returns for 2010 and subsequent years remain open to examination.  Our California tax returns for 2008 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination.  Massachusetts tax returns for 2008, 2010 and subsequent years remain open to examination.

During the third quarter of 2013 we recorded a one-time prior period tax expense adjustment of

$7 million

, respectively.

Currently, we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from these net operating loss carryforwards, which are associated with our former eProsper business unit, part of SVB Analytics, and our UK operations, will not be realized in the near term due to uncertainties in the timing of future profitability in those businesses.

Incentive Compensation Plan

Our Incentive Compensation Plan (“ICP”) is an annual cash incentive plan that rewards performance based on our financial results and other performance criteria. Awards are made based on company performance, the employee's target bonus level, and management's assessment of individual employee performance.

Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan

The Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan (“Direct Drive”) is an annual sales incentive program. Awards are based on sales teams' performance to predetermined financial targets and other company/individual performance criteria. Actual awards for each sales team member under Direct Drive are based on: (i) the actual results and financial performance with respect to the incentive gross profit targets; (ii) the sales team payout targets; and (iii) the sales team member's sales position and team payout allocation.

Retention Program

The Retention Program (“RP”) is a long-term incentive plan that allows designated employees to share directly in our investment success. Plan participants are granted an interest in the distributions of gains from certain designated investments made by us during the applicable year. Specifically, participants share in: (i) returns from designated investments made by us, including investments in certain venture capital and private equity funds, debt funds, and direct equity investments in companies; (ii) income realized from the exercise of, and the subsequent sale of shares obtained through the exercise of, warrants held by us; and (iii) other designated amounts as determined by us. No new participants are being added and no new investments will be designated to the plan.

Warrant Incentive Plan

The Warrant Incentive Plan provides individual and team awards to those employees who negotiate warrants on our behalf. Designated participants, as determined by the Company, share in the cash proceeds received by the Company from the exercise of equity warrant assets.

401(k) and ESOP

The 401(k) Plan and ESOP, collectively referred to as the “Plan”, is a combined 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan and employee stock ownership plan in which all regular U.S. employees are eligible to participate.

Employees participating in the 401(k) Plan are allowed to contribute up to

75 percent

of their pre-tax pay as defined in the Plan, up to the maximum annual amount allowable under federal income tax regulations of

$17,500

for the year 2013,

$17,000

for the year 2012 and

$16,500

for 2011. We match the employee's contributions dollar-for-dollar, up to

5 percent

of the employee's pre-tax pay as defined in the Plan. Our matching contributions vest immediately. The amount of salary deferred, up to the allowed maximum, is not subject to federal or state income taxes at the time of deferral.

Discretionary ESOP contributions, based on our company performance, are made by us to all eligible individuals employed by us on the last day of the fiscal year. We may elect to contribute cash or our common stock (or a combination of cash and stock), in an amount not exceeding

10 percent

of the employee's eligible pay earned in the fiscal year. The ESOP contributions vest in equal annual increments over

five

years during a participant's first five years of service (thereafter all subsequent ESOP contributions are fully vested).

EHOP

The EHOP is a benefit plan that provides for the issuance of mortgage loans at favorable interest rates to eligible employees. Eligible employees may apply for a fixed-rate mortgage for their primary residence, which is due and payable in either

five

or

seven

years and is based on amortization over a


year period. Applicants must qualify for a loan through the normal mortgage review and approval process, which is typical of industry standards. The maximum loan amount generally cannot be greater than

80 percent

of the lesser of the purchase price or the appraised value. The interest rate on the loan is written at the then market rate for five year (5/1) or seven year (7/1) mortgage loans as determined by us. However, provided that the applicant continues to meet all the eligibility requirements, including employment, the actual rate charged to the borrower shall be up to

2 percent

below the market rate.

The loan rate shall not be less than the greater of either the jumbo conforming market rate (corresponding to the maturity of the loan) or the monthly Applicable Federal Rate for medium-term loans as published by the Internal Revenue Service. The loan rate will be fixed at the time of approval and locked in for 30 days.

Deferred Compensation Plan

Under the Deferred Compensation Plan (the “DC Plan”), eligible employees may elect to defer up to

50 percent

of their base salary and/or up to

100 percent

of any eligible bonus payment to which they are entitled, for a period of


consecutive months, beginning January 1 and ending December 31. Any amounts deferred under the DC Plan will be invested and administered by us (or such person we designate). We do not match employee deferrals to the DC Plan.

Voluntary deferrals under the DC Plan were

$3.6 million

Commitments to Extend Credit

A commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. Such commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, or other termination clauses, and usually require a fee paid by the client upon us issuing the commitment. The following table summarizes information related to our commitments to extend credit at

(5)

Our reserve for unfunded credit commitments includes an allowance for both our unfunded loan commitments and our letters of credit.

Our potential exposure to credit loss for commitments to extend credit, in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument, is the contractual amount of the available unused loan commitment. We use the same credit approval and monitoring process in extending credit commitments as we do in making loans. The actual liquidity needs and the credit risk that we have experienced have historically been lower than the contractual amount of commitments to extend credit because a significant portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. We evaluate each potential borrower and the necessary collateral on an individual basis. The type of collateral varies, but may include real property, intellectual property, bank deposits, or business and personal assets. The credit risk associated with these commitments is considered in the reserve for unfunded credit commitments.

Commercial and Standby Letters of Credit

Commercial and standby letters of credit represent conditional commitments issued by us on behalf of a client to guarantee the performance of the client to a third party when certain specified future events have occurred. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily for inventory purchases by a client and are typically short-term in nature. We provide two types of standby letters of credit: performance and financial standby letters of credit. Performance standby letters of credit are issued to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party when certain specified future events have occurred and are primarily used to support performance instruments such as bid bonds, performance bonds, lease obligations, repayment of loans, and past due notices. Financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the payment by a client to a third party (beneficiary) and are primarily used to support many types of domestic and international payments. These standby letters of credit have fixed expiration dates and generally require a fee to be paid by the client at the time we issue the commitment. Fees generated from these standby letters of credit are recognized in noninterest income over the commitment period using the straight-line method.

The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with extending credit commitments to clients, and accordingly, we use a credit evaluation process and collateral requirements similar to those for credit commitments. Our standby letters of credit often are cash secured by our clients. The actual liquidity needs and the credit risk that we have experienced historically have been lower than the contractual amount of letters of credit issued because a significant portion of these conditional commitments expire without being drawn upon.

The table below summarizes our commercial and standby letters of credit at

December 31, 2013

. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the amount that could be remitted under letters of credit if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from the collateral held or pledged.

Commitments to Invest in Venture Capital and Private Equity Funds

We make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, which in turn make investments generally in, or in some cases make loans to, privately-held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally made for a


-year period from the inception of the fund. Although the limited partnership agreements governing these investments typically do not restrict the general partners from calling

100%

of committed capital in one year, it is customary for these funds to generally call most of the capital commitments over


to


years; however in certain cases, the funds may not call

100%

of committed capital over the life of the fund. The actual timing of future cash requirements to fund these commitments is generally dependent upon the investment cycle, overall market conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held companies operate. The following table details our total capital commitments, unfunded capital commitments, and our ownership percentage in each fund at

December 31, 2013

:

(1)

Our ownership includes direct ownership of

1.3 percent

and indirect ownership of

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair Value Measurements

Our available-for-sale securities, derivative instruments and certain non-marketable, marketable and other securities are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.

Unrealized gains are recorded on the line item “gains on derivative instruments, net”, a component of noninterest income.

The extent to which any unrealized gains will become realized is subject to a variety of factors, including, among other things, the expiration of current sales restrictions to which these securities are subject, the actual sales of securities and the timing of such actual sales.  Both FireEye and Twitter are each subject to a lock-up agreement.

The following table presents quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used for certain of our Level 3 fair value measurements at

December 31, 2013

. We have not included in this table our venture capital and private equity fund investments (fair value accounting) as we use net asset value per share (as obtained from the general partners of the investments) as a practical expedient to determine fair value.



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

(1)

In determining the fair value of our other venture capital investment portfolio, we evaluate a variety of factors related to each underlying private portfolio company including, but not limited to, actual and forecasted results, cash position, recent or planned transactions and market comparable companies. Additionally, we have ongoing communication with the portfolio companies and venture capital fund managers, to determine whether there is a material change in fair value. These factors are specific to each portfolio company and a weighted average or range of values of the unobservable inputs is not meaningful.

(2)

We adjust quoted market prices of public companies which are subject to certain sales restrictions.  Sales restriction discounts generally range from 10 percent to 20 percent depending on the duration of the sales restrictions which typically range from 3 to 6 months.

(3)

Our marketability discount is applied to all private company warrants to account for a general lack of liquidity due to the private nature of the associated underlying company. The quantitative measure used is based on long-run averages and is influenced over time by various factors, including market conditions. On a quarterly basis, a sensitivity analysis is performed on our marketability discount.

(4)

We adjust the contractual remaining term of private company warrants based on our best estimate of the actual remaining life, which we determine by utilizing historical data on cancellations and exercises. At

December 31, 2013

, the weighted average contractual remaining term was

6.3

years, compared to our estimated remaining life of

2.8

years. On a quarterly basis, a sensitivity analysis is performed on our remaining life assumption.

During


, there were no transfers between Level 2 and Level 1, compared to transfers of

$3.1 million

and

$3.9 million

from Level 2 to Level 1 in


and 2011, respectively. During 2013, a new sales restriction discount was applied to the valuation of public equity warrant assets, which were subject to certain sales restrictions.  The application of this discount resulted in a transfer of

$24.2 million

of public equity warrant assets from Level 2 to Level 3. Transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 during


and 2012 included

$3.6 million

and

$7.6 million

, respectively, as a result of the expiration of lock-up, and other sales, restrictions on certain of our other venture capital investments.

All other transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 during


,


and


were due to the transfer of equity warrant assets from our private portfolio to our public portfolio (See our Level 3 reconciliation above). All amounts reported as transfers represent the fair value as of the date of the change in circumstances that caused the transfer.

Financial Instruments not Carried at Fair Value

FASB guidance over financial instruments requires that we disclose estimated fair values for our financial instruments not carried at fair value. Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth below for our financial instruments, are made solely to comply with these requirements.

Fair values are based on estimates or calculations at the transaction level using present value techniques in instances where quoted market prices are not available. Because broadly traded markets do not exist for many of our financial instruments, the fair value calculations attempt to incorporate the effect of current market conditions at a specific time. The aggregation of the fair value calculations presented herein does not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of the Company.

The following describes the methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments, excluding financial instruments already recorded at fair value as described above.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash balances due from banks, interest-earning deposits, securities purchased under agreement to resell and other short-term investment securities. The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the insignificant risk of changes in fair value due to changes in market interest rates, and the instruments are purchased in conjunction with our cash management activities.

Non-Marketable and Other Securities (Cost and Equity Method Accounting)

Non-marketable and other securities includes other investments (equity method accounting), low income housing tax credit funds (equity method accounting), venture capital and private equity fund investments (cost method accounting), and other venture capital investments (cost method accounting). Other investments (equity method accounting) includes our investment in SPD-SVB, our joint venture bank in China. At this time, the carrying value of our investment in SPD-SVB is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of the remaining other investments (equity method accounting) and the fair value of venture capital and private equity fund investments (cost method accounting) and other venture capital investments (cost method

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

accounting) is based on financial information obtained from the investee or obtained from the fund investments’ or debt fund investments’ respective general partners. For private company investments, estimated fair value is based on consideration of a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, exit strategies, and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. For our fund investments, we utilize the net asset value per share as obtained from the general partners of the investments. We adjust the net asset value per share for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment’s net asset value by using the most recently available financial information from the investee general partner, for example

September 30

th

, for our December 31

st

consolidated financial statements, adjusted for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and significant fund transactions or market events during the reporting period. The carrying value of our low income housing tax credit funds (equity method accounting) is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Loans

The fair value of fixed and variable rate loans is estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using rates that reflect current pricing for similar loans and the projected forward yield curve. This method is not based on the exit price concept of fair value required under ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

.

FHLB and FRB stock

Investments in FHLB and FRB stock are recorded at cost. The carrying amounts of these investments are reasonable estimates of fair value because the securities are restricted to member banks and they do not have a readily determinable market value.

Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable

The carrying amounts of accrued interest receivable and payable are reasonable estimates of fair value due to the short-term nature of these balances.

Deposits

The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing checking accounts, money market accounts and interest-bearing sweep deposits is equal to the amount payable on demand at the measurement date. The fair value of time deposits is estimated by discounting the cash flows using our cost of borrowings and the projected forward yield curve over their remaining contractual term.

Short-Term Borrowings

Short-term borrowings at both

December 31, 2013

and 2012 included federal funds purchased and cash collateral received from our counterparty for our interest rate swap agreement related to our

6.05%

Subordinated Notes. Short-term borrowings at December 31, 2012 also included federal funds purchased. The carrying amounts of our federal funds purchased is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the relatively short time between the origination of the instrument and its contractual maturity. The carrying amount of the cash collateral is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt at

December 31, 2013

and 2012 included our

5.375%

Senior Notes,

7.0%

Junior Subordinated Debentures and

6.05%

Subordinated Notes.  The fair value of long-term debt is generally based on quoted market prices, when available, or is estimated based on calculations utilizing third-party pricing services and current market spread, price indications from reputable dealers or observable market prices of the underlying instrument(s), whichever is deemed more reliable. Also included in the estimated fair value of our

6.05%

Subordinated Notes are amounts related to hedge accounting associated with the notes.

Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments

The fair value of net available commitments to extend credit is estimated based on the average amount we would receive or pay to execute a new agreement with identical terms and pricing, while taking into account the counterparties’ credit standing.

Letters of credit are carried at their fair value, which is equivalent to the residual premium or fee at

December 31, 2013

Investments in Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share

FASB guidance over certain fund investments requires that we disclose the fair value of funds, significant investment strategies of the investees, redemption features of the investees, restrictions on the ability to sell investments, estimate of the period of time over which the underlying assets are expected to be liquidated by the investee, and unfunded commitments related to the investments.

Our investments in debt funds and venture capital and private equity fund investments generally cannot be redeemed. Alternatively, we expect distributions, if any, to be received primarily through IPOs and M&A activity of the underlying assets of the fund. We currently do not have any plans to sell any of these fund investments. If we decide to sell these investments in the future, the investee fund’s management must approve of the buyer before the sale of the investments can be completed. The fair values of the fund investments have been estimated using the net asset value per share of the investments, adjusted for any differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment’s net asset value by using the most recently available financial information from the investee general partner, for example

September 30

Venture capital and private equity fund investments within non-marketable and other securities (fair value accounting) include investments made by our managed funds of funds and one of our direct venture funds.

Included in the fair value and unfunded commitments of fund investments under fair value accounting are

$786 million

Regulatory Matters

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board and the California Department of Financial Institutions (“DFI”). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) required that the federal regulatory agencies adopt regulations defining five capital categories for banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Quantitative measures, established by the regulators to ensure capital adequacy, require that SVB Financial Group and the Bank maintain minimum ratios (set forth in the table below) of capital to risk-weighted assets. There are three categories of capital under the guidelines. Tier 1 capital includes common stockholders' equity (excluding any net unrealized gains or losses, after applicable taxes, on available-for-sale securities), qualifying preferred stock and trust preferred securities, less goodwill and certain other deductions (including the net unrealized losses, after applicable taxes, on available-for-sale equity securities carried at fair value). At least 50 percent of the qualifying total capital should consist of Tier 1 capital. Components of Tier 2 capital include preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 capital, qualifying subordinated debt, the allowance for credit losses, up to a maximum of 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets and unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities, subject to limitations set by the guidelines. Tier 3 capital includes certain qualifying unsecured subordinated debt. We did not have any Tier 3 capital as of

December 31, 2013

and


.

As of December 31, 2013, both SVB Financial and the Bank were considered “well-capitalized” for regulatory purposes under existing capital guidelines.  There are no conditions or events since that date that management believes would have a material impact on that capital category.

Segment Reporting

We have

three

reportable segments for management reporting purposes: Global Commercial Bank, SVB Private Bank and SVB Capital. The results of our operating segments are based on our internal management reporting process.

Our operating segments’ primary source of revenue is from net interest income, which is primarily the difference between interest earned on loans, net of funds transfer pricing (“FTP”), and interest paid on deposits, net of FTP. Accordingly, our segments are reported using net interest income, net of FTP. FTP is an internal measurement framework designed to assess the financial impact of a financial institution’s sources and uses of funds. It is the mechanism by which an earnings credit is given for deposits raised, and an earnings charge is made for funded loans. FTP is calculated at an instrument level based on account characteristics.

We also evaluate performance based on provision for loan losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense, which are presented as components of segment operating profit or loss. In calculating each operating segment’s noninterest expense, we consider the direct costs incurred by the operating segment as well as certain allocated direct costs. As part of this review, we allocate certain corporate overhead costs to a corporate account. We do not allocate income taxes to our segments. Additionally, our management reporting model is predicated on average asset balances; therefore, period-end asset balances are not presented for segment reporting purposes. Changes in an individual client’s primary relationship designation have resulted, and in the future may result, in the inclusion of certain clients in different segments in different periods.

Unlike financial reporting, which benefits from the comprehensive structure provided by GAAP, our internal management reporting process is highly subjective, as there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our management reporting process measures the performance of our operating segments based on our internal operating structure,

which is subject to change from time to time, and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial services companies.

The following is a description of the services that our

three

reportable segments provide (for further description of these reportable segments, refer to "Business–Business Overview" under Part I, Item 1 of this report):

Global Commercial Bank

provides solutions to the financial needs of commercial clients through lending, deposit products, cash management services, and global banking and trade products and services. It also serves the needs of our non-U.S. clients with global banking products, including loans, deposits and global finance, in key foreign entrepreneurial markets, where applicable. Our Global Commercial Bank segment is comprised of results from our Commercial Bank, and also includes SVB Specialty Lending, SVB Analytics and our Debt Fund Investments.

•

SVB Private Bank

provides banking products and a range of credit services primarily to venture capital/private equity professionals using both long-term secured and short-term unsecured lines of credit.

•

SVB Capital

is the venture capital investment arm of SVBFG, which focuses primarily on funds management. SVB Capital manages funds (primarily venture capital funds) on behalf of third party limited partners and SVB Financial Group. The SVB Capital family of funds is comprised of funds of funds and direct venture funds. SVB Capital generates income for the Company primarily through management fees, carried interest arrangements and returns through the Company’s investments in the funds.

The summary financial results of our operating segments are presented along with a reconciliation to our consolidated  results. The Other Items column reflects the adjustments necessary to reconcile the results of the operating segments to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. Noninterest income in the Other Items column is primarily attributable to noncontrolling interests and gains on equity warrant assets. Noninterest expense in the Other Items column primarily consists of expenses associated with corporate support functions such as finance, human resources, marketing, legal and other expenses. Additionally, average assets in the Other Items column primarily consists of cash and cash equivalents.

Legal Matters

Certain lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed or are pending against us or our affiliates. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we establish accruals for all lawsuits, claims and expected settlements when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, we do not establish an accrual. Any such loss estimates are inherently uncertain, based on currently available information and are subject to management’s judgment and various assumptions. Due to the inherent subjectivity of these estimates and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate resolution of such matters.

To the extent we believe any potential loss relating to such lawsuits and claims may have a material impact on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or our business as a whole and is reasonably possible but not probable, we disclose information relating to any such potential loss, whether in excess of any established accruals or where there is no

established accrual. We also disclose information relating to any material potential loss that is probable but not reasonably estimable. Where reasonably practicable, we will provide an estimate of loss or range of potential loss. No disclosures are generally made for any loss contingencies that are deemed to be remote.

Based upon information available to us, our review of lawsuits and claims filed or pending against us to date and consultation with our outside legal counsel, we have not recognized a material accrual liability for these matters, nor do we currently expect it is reasonably possible that these matters will result in a material liability to the Company. However, the outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that one or more of such matters currently pending or threatened could have an unanticipated material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or our business as a whole, in the future.

Subsequent Events

Update on Securities and Warrant Valuations for the First Quarter of 2014

As previously noted in prior disclosures, SVB and certain equity investment funds managed by SVB Capital, our funds management business, hold warrants as well as direct and indirect investments in FireEye.  Since our valuation of those investments as of December 31, 2013, the stock price of FireEye has significantly increased to a closing price of

$80.00

as of February 25, 2014 compared to its closing price of

$43.61

at December 31, 2013.  Based on this incremental increase in stock price thus far during the first quarter of 2014, and certain sales restrictions, if any, in place at March 31, 2014, we would expect to include in our financial results for the first quarter of 2014 total combined pre-tax gains net of noncontrolling interests from our equity warrant assets and our investment securities of approximately

$53 million

to

$63 million

.  This is comprised of gains from our equity warrant assets of approximately

$13 million

and gains net of noncontrolling interests from our investment



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

securities of approximately

$40 million

to

$50 million

(total gross gains, including noncontrolling interests, would be approximately

$200 million

to

$250 million

) for the first quarter of 2014. (This is a non-GAAP financial measure.  See reconciliation below.)

Any actual investment gains (or losses) that we would record for the first quarter of 2014 are subject to FireEye’s stock price specifically as of March 31, 2014, which is subject to market conditions and other factors.  Given that it is still early in the first quarter, FireEye’s valuation and its estimated impact on our first quarter 2014 financial results, are subject to change, and actual results may differ. Additionally, these gains are currently unrealized gains, and the extent to which such gains will become realized is subject to a variety of factors, including among other things, the expiration of current lock-up agreements to which the securities are subject, the timing of any actual sales of the securities by us, changes in the valuation of the securities, and market conditions.

The table below sets forth a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure discussed above:

(a)

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, among other things, processes, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of

December 31, 2013

pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15b. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

December 31, 2013

.

(b)

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting at the Company. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, transactions and dispositions of the company's assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and the directors of the company, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As of

December 31, 2013

, the Company carried out an assessment, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15(c), as adopted by the SEC under the Exchange Act. In evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, management used the framework established in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992),” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of

December 31, 2013

, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.

KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of the Company, has issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013
