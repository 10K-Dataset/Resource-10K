ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

SVB Financial Group (formerly known as Silicon Valley
Bancshares) is a bank holding company and a financial holding company that was
incorporated in the state of Delaware in March 1999. Our principal
subsidiary, Silicon Valley Bank, is a California state-chartered bank and a
member of the Federal Reserve System. Silicon Valley Bank’s deposits are
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Our corporate
headquarters is located at 3003 Tasman Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054 and
our telephone number is 408.654.7400. When we refer to “SVB Financial Group,”
the “Company,” or “we,” or use similar words, we intend to include SVB
Financial Group and all of its subsidiaries collectively, including Silicon
Valley Bank. When we refer to “SVB Financial” or the “Parent” we are referring
only to the parent company, SVB Financial Group.

For over 20 years, SVB
Financial Group has been dedicated to helping entrepreneurs succeed,
specifically focusing on industries where we have deep knowledge and
relationships. Our focus is on the technology, life science, private equity,
and premium wine industries. We continue to diversify our products and services
to support our clients throughout their life cycles, regardless of age or size.
We offer a range of financial services that generate three distinct sources of
income.

Income Sources

In part, our income is generated from interest-rate
differentials. The difference between the interest rates paid by us on
interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the
interest rates received on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to
clients and securities held in our investment portfolio, account for the major
portion of our earnings.  That income,
referred to as net interest income, was $299.3 million in 2005, $229.5 million
in 2004, and $183.1 million in 2003. (For further information  see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data.)

Our deposits are largely obtained from commercial
clients within our technology, life science, private equity, and premium wine
industry sectors, and, to a lesser extent, from individuals served by our
Private Client Services group. We do not obtain deposits from conventional
retail sources and have no brokered deposits. As part of negotiated credit
facilities and certain other services, we frequently obtain rights to acquire
stock in the form of equity warrants in certain client companies.

Fee-based services also generate income for our
business. We market our full range of financial services to all of our
commercial and private equity firm clients. In addition to commercial banking
and private client services, we offer fee-based merger and acquisition
services, private placements, and investment and advisory services. Our ability
to integrate and cross-sell our diverse financial services to our clients is a
strength of our business model. Our non-interest income was $117.5 million in
2005, $107.8 million in 2004 and $81.4 million in 2003. (For further
information  see Item 8. Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.)

In addition, we seek to obtain equity returns through
investments in direct equity and venture capital fund investments. We manage
four limited partnerships: a venture capital fund that invests directly in
privately-held companies and three funds that invest in other venture capital
funds.

We are able to offer our
clients financial products and services through five strategic business groups,
as discussed in further detail below: Commercial Banking, SVB Capital, SVB
Alliant, Global Financial Services and Private Client Services and Other. These
operating groups are managed separately because they offer different services
to our clients, may appeal to different markets and require different
strategies. The Private Client Services and Global Financial Services groups
did not meet the separate reporting


thresholds
for segment reporting purposes. For further information on our reportable
business segments, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 22 Segment Reporting.

Business Overview

SVB Financial Group is
organized into strategic business groups that manage the diverse financial
services we offer:

Commercial Banking

Through Silicon Valley Bank and its subsidiaries, we
provide solutions to meet the needs of our commercial clients in the
technology, life science, premium wine industry, and venture capital and
private equity firm clients through lending, deposit account, cash management,
and global banking and trade products and services.

Through our lending products and services, we extend
loans and other credit facilities to our commercial clients, most often secured
by the intellectual property or other assets of our clients. Lending products
and services include traditional term loans, equipment loans, revolving lines
of credit, accounts-receivable based lines of credit, asset-based loans, real
estate loans, vineyard development loans, and financing of affordable housing
projects. We may obtain warrants to purchase an equity position in a client
company’s stock in consideration for providing credit facilities or other
services.

Our deposit account and cash management products and
services provide commercial clients with short- and long-term cash management
solutions. Deposit account products and services include traditional deposit
and checking accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts. In
connection with deposit accounts, we also provide lockbox and merchant services
that facilitate quicker depositing of checks and other payments to clients’
accounts. Cash management products and services include wire transfer and
Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment services to enable clients to transfer
funds quickly from their deposit accounts. Additionally, the cash management
services unit provides collection services, disbursement services, electronic
funds transfers, and online banking through SVBeConnect.

Our global banking and trade products and services
facilitate our clients’ global finance and business needs. These products and
services include foreign exchange services that allow commercial clients to
manage their foreign currency risks through the purchase and sale of currencies
on the global inter-bank market. To facilitate our clients’ international
trade, we offer a variety of loans and credit facilities guaranteed by the
Export-Import Bank of the United States. We also offer letters of credit,
including export, import, and standby letters of credit, to enable clients to
ship and receive goods globally.

Silicon Valley Bank
provides investment and advisory services to clients through our broker-dealer
subsidiary, SVB Securities, Inc. (“SVB Securities”). SVB Securities is a
broker-dealer registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
and a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD”).
Services offered by SVB Securities involve introducing mutual funds and fixed
income securities on an agency or riskless principal basis. SVB Securities does
not hold customer accounts. We also offer investment advisory services through
SVB Asset Management, a registered investment advisor subsidiary of Silicon
Valley Bank. SVB Asset Management specializes in outsourced treasury
management, customized cash portfolio management and reporting and monitoring
for corporations.

SVB Capital

SVB Capital (formerly referred to as our Merchant
Banking group) focuses on the business needs of our venture capital and private
equity clients, establishing and maintaining relationships with those firms


domestically and
internationally. Through this segment, we provide banking services and
financial solutions, including traditional deposit and checking accounts,
loans, letters of credit, and cash management services.

SVB Capital also makes investments in venture capital
and other private equity firms and in companies in the niches we serve. The
group also manages four venture funds that are consolidated into our financial
statements: SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP, SVB Strategic Investors Fund II,
LP, SVB Strategic Investors Fund III, LP which are funds of funds that invest
in other venture funds; and Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP, a direct-equity
venture fund that invests in privately held technology and life-science
companies. This segment also includes investments in Gold Hill Venture Lending
Partners 03, LP, and its parallel funds (collectively known as Gold Hill
Venture Lending Partners 03. LP), which provide secured debt to emerging-growth
clients in their earliest stages; and Partners for Growth, LP, a special
situation debt fund that provides secured debt to higher-risk, emerging-growth
clients in their later stages.

During the first half of
2005 SVB Capital, through Private Equities Services (a division of SVB
Securities), also assisted private equity firms, and the partners of such
firms, with liquidating securities following initial public offerings and
mergers and acquisitions, including in-kind stock transactions, restricted
stock sales, block trading, and special situations trading such as liquidation
of foreign securities. We exited this business during the third quarter of 2005
and ceased operations of the Private Equity Services division at that time.

SVB Alliant

Through SVB Alliant
(formerly known as Alliant Partners), our investment banking subsidiary, we
provide merger and acquisition advisory services (M&A), private placement
advisory services through our Private Capital Group, strategic alliance
services, and specialized financial studies such as valuations and fairness
opinions. SVB Alliant is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and a member
of the NASD. In 2005, we established SVB Alliant Europe Limited, a subsidiary
based in London, England, that will provide investment advisory services to
companies in Europe when the subsidiary becomes licensed to do so by the
Financial Services Authority in England.

Global Financial Services

Our Global Financial
Services group, which we began referring to as “SVB Global” in 2006,
facilitates our clients’ global expansion into major technology centers around
the world by leveraging our worldwide network of contacts, including venture
capitalists, corporate connections and service providers. Global Financial
Services provides consulting and business services, referrals, and knowledge
sharing, as well as identifying business opportunities for SVB Financial Group,
through several global subsidiaries of SVB Financial Group including SVB
Business Partners (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., SVB Europe Advisors Limited and SVB
India Advisors Pvt. Ltd. In 2005 we established SVB Business Partners
(Shanghai) Co., Ltd., a subsidiary based in Shanghai, China, that provides
consulting and business services as well as serving as a hub for companies
expanding business activities in China. In 2004, we established SVB Europe
Advisors Limited, a subsidiary based in London, England, that provides
consulting and business services, as well as access to financial services of
Silicon Valley Bank to clients and prospects based in Europe in the niches we
serve. In 2004, we also established SVB India Advisors Pvt. Ltd., a subsidiary
based in Bangalore, India, that provides consulting and business services to
facilitate technology companies and private equity firms pursuing international
business in India. SVB India Advisors also provides services such as
educational information, introductions to recommended service providers and
networking events. Our Global Financial Group also provides banking services to
international venture capital and private equity firms.


Private Client Services and Other

Our Private Client
Services and Other group are principally comprised of our Private Client
Services group and other business services units. Private Client Services
(formerly Private Banking) provides a wide range of credit services to
high-net-worth individuals using both long-term secured and short-term
unsecured lines of credit. Those products and services include home equity
lines of credit, secured lines of credit, restricted stock purchase loans,
airplane loans, and capital call lines of credit. We also help our clients meet
their cash management needs by providing deposit account products and services,
including checking accounts, deposit accounts, money market accounts, and
certificates of deposit. Through our subsidiary, Woodside Asset Management, Inc.,
we provide individual clients with personal investment advisory services,
assisting clients in establishing and implementing investment strategies to
meet their individual needs and goals.

Industry Niches

In each of the industry
niches we serve, we provide services to meet the needs of our clients
throughout their life cycles, from early stage through maturity.

Technology and Life
Science

We serve a variety of clients in the technology and
life-science industries. A key component of our technology and life-science
business strategy is to develop relationships with clients at an early stage
and offer them banking services that will continue to meet their needs as they
mature and expand. We define “emerging-growth” clients as companies in the
start-up or early stages of their lifecycle; these companies tend to be
privately held and backed by venture capital; they generally have few
employees, are primarily engaged in research and development, have brought
relatively few products or services to market, and have no or little revenue.
By contrast, we define “established” or “corporate technology” clients as
companies that tend to be more mature; these companies may be publicly traded,
and more established in the markets in which they participate.

The emerging growth clients, generally keep large cash
balances in their deposit accounts and usually do not borrow large amounts
under their credit facilities. The primary source of funding for most early
stage clients is equity from venture capitalists and public markets. Lending to
this market typically involves working capital lines of credit, equipment
financing, asset acquisition loans, and bridge financing between funding
rounds.

By expanding our suite of financial services, we have
extended our business to more mature companies. Our corporate technology
practice is a network of senior lenders focused primarily on the specific
financial needs of more mature private and public clients. Today, we can
comfortably address the financial needs of all companies in our niches, whether
they are entrepreneurs testing new ideas or multinational corporations with
established models and hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.

Our technology and
life science clients generally fall into the following industries:

•

Hardware: Semiconductors,
Communications, and Electronics

•

Software: Software and
Services

•

Biotechnology

•

Drug Discovery

•

Medical Devices

•

Specialty
Pharmaceuticals


Private Equity

Since our founding, we
have cultivated strong relationships with venture capital firms worldwide, many
of which are also clients. SVB Capital provides financial services to a
significant number of venture capital firms in the United States (more than
500) as well as to other private equity firms, facilitating deal flow to and
from these private equity firms and participating in direct investments in
their portfolio companies.

Premium Wine

Our Wine Group, which is
part of Silicon Valley Bank, has become one of the leading providers of
financial services to the U.S. premium wine industry. We focus on vineyards and
wineries that produce grapes and wines of the highest quality.

Industry Niches
Exited

In keeping with our strategic focus on the technology,
life science, private equity, and premium wine industries, we exited three
niches in late 2002: real estate, media, and religious lending. We will
continue to service our existing real estate, media, and religious niche loans
until they are paid-off.

For further information on
our business segments, see Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 22 Segment Reporting.

Business
Combinations

On October 1, 2002, we acquired substantially all
of the assets of Woodside Asset Management, Inc., an investment advisory
firm, which had approximately $200 million under management for 70 clients. We
offer Woodside Asset Management’s services as part of our Private Client
Services group, which is part of Silicon Valley Bank. Additionally, as part of
this acquisition, SVB Financial Group obtained the general partner interests in
two limited partnerships: Taurus Growth Partners, LP and Libra Partners, LP.
Both of these funds were liquidated and funds were fully disbursed to the
limited partners by December 31, 2004. We had less than a 1% ownership
interest in each of these funds. The remaining ownership interest represented
limited partners’ funds invested on their behalf by the general partner in
certain fixed income and marketable equity securities.

On September 28,
2001, SVB Securities, a subsidiary of Silicon Valley Bank, completed the
acquisition of SVB Alliant (at that time called “Alliant Partners”), an
investment banking firm providing merger and acquisition and corporate
partnering services. On October 1, 2002, SVB Alliant was sold from our
Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary to the SVB Financial Group.

Competition

The banking and financial
services industry is highly competitive, and evolves as a result of changes in
regulation, technology, product delivery systems, and the general market and
economic climate. Our current competitors include other banks and specialty and
diversified financial services companies that offer lending, leasing, other
financial products, and advisory services to our target client base. The
principal competitive factors in our markets include product offerings,
service, and pricing. Given our established market position with the client
segments that we serve, and our ability to integrate and cross-sell our diverse
financial services to extend the length of our relationships with our clients,
we believe we compete favorably in all our markets in these areas.


Employees

As of December 31,
2005, we employed approximately 1,033 full-time equivalent employees. To our
knowledge, none of our employees are represented by a labor union. Competition
for qualified personnel in our industry is significant, particularly for client
relationship manager positions, officers, and employees with strong
relationships with the venture capital community. Our future success will
depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified
personnel.

Supervision and
Regulation

General

Our operations are subject
to extensive regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies. As a bank
holding company, SVB Financial is subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s
supervision, regulation, examination and reporting requirements under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act). SVB Financial has also qualified and
elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the BHC Act. Silicon
Valley Bank, as a California-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve
System, is subject to primary supervision and examination by the Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the California Department of Financial
Institutions. Both SVB Financial and Silicon Valley Bank are required to file
periodic reports with these regulators and provide any additional information
that they may require. The following summary describes some of the more
significant laws, regulations, and policies that affect our operations; it is
not intended to be a complete listing of all laws that apply to us. Any change
in the statutes, regulations, or policies that apply to our operations may have
a material effect on our business.

Regulation of
Holding Company

The Federal Reserve Board requires SVB Financial to
maintain minimum capital ratios, as discussed below in Regulatory Capital.
Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is also required to
serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks
and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition,
it is the Federal Reserve Board’s policy that in serving as a source of
strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should stand ready to
use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary
banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the
financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional
resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company’s failure
to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary
banks or to observe established guidelines with respect to the payment of
dividends by bank holding companies will generally be considered by the Federal
Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice, a violation of the
Federal Reserve Board’s regulations, or both.

Prior to becoming a financial holding company, SVB
Financial was required under the BHC Act to seek the prior approval of the
Federal Reserve Board before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control
of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities, or
substantially all of the assets, of any bank, bank holding company, or non-bank
company. In addition, prior to becoming a financial holding company, SVB
Financial was generally limited under the BHC Act to engaging, directly or
indirectly, only in the business of banking or managing or controlling banks
and other activities that were deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be so
closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act) amended
the BHC Act to permit a qualifying bank holding company, called a financial
holding company, to engage in a broader range of activities than those
traditionally permissible for bank holding companies. A financial holding
company may conduct activities that are “financial in nature,” including
insurance, securities underwriting and dealing and market-making, and merchant
banking activities, as well as additional activities that the Federal Reserve
Board determines


(in the case of incidental
activities, in conjunction with the Treasury Department) are incidental or
complementary to financial activities, without the prior approval of the
Federal Reserve Board. The GLB Act also permits financial holding companies to
acquire companies engaged in activities that are financial in nature or that
are incidental or complementary to financial activities without the prior
approval of the Federal Reserve Board. The GLB Act also repealed the provisions
of the Glass-Steagall Act that restricted banks and securities firms from
affiliating. On November 14, 2000, SVB Financial became a financial
holding company. As a financial holding company, SVB Financial no longer
requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to conduct, or to
acquire ownership or control of entities engaged in, activities that are
financial in nature or activities that are determined to be incidental or
complementary to financial activities, although the requirement in the BHC Act
for prior Federal Reserve Board approval for the acquisition by a bank holding
company of more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of a bank or savings
association (or the holding company of either) is still applicable.
Additionally, under the merchant banking authority added by the GLB Act, SVB
Financial may invest in companies that engage in activities that are not
otherwise permissible, subject to certain limitations, including that SVB
Financial make the investment with the intention of limiting the investment in
duration and does not manage the company on a day-to-day basis.

To qualify as a financial holding company, a bank
holding company’s subsidiary depository institutions must be well capitalized
(as discussed below in Regulatory Capital) and have at least “satisfactory”
composite, managerial and Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) examination
ratings. A bank holding company that does not satisfy the criteria for
financial holding company status is limited to activities that were permissible
under the BHC Act prior to the enactment of the GLB Act. A financial holding
company that does not continue to meet all of the requirements for financial
holding company status will, depending upon which requirements it fails to
meet, loses the ability to undertake new activities or acquisitions that are
not generally permissible for bank holding companies and may not continue such
activities.

SVB Financial is also
treated as a bank holding company under the California Financial Code. As such,
SVB Financial and its subsidiaries are subject to periodic examination by, and
may be required to file reports with, the California Department of Financial
Institutions.

Regulatory Capital

The federal banking agencies have adopted minimum
risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks are expected
to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated
with a banking organization’s operations for both transactions reported on the
balance sheet as assets and those recorded as off-balance sheet items. These
off-balance sheet items include transactions such as commitments, letters of
credit, and recourse arrangements. Under these credit guidelines, dollar
amounts of assets and credit-equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are
adjusted by one of several conversion factors and/or risk adjustment
percentages. The Federal Reserve Board requires bank holding companies and
state member banks generally to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total
capital to risk-adjusted assets of 8% (10% to be well-capitalized). At least
half of total capital must consist of items such as common stock, retained
earnings, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, minority interests
(including trust preferred securities) and, for bank holding companies, a
limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less most
intangibles including goodwill (“Tier 1 capital”). The remainder (“Tier 2
capital”) may consist of other preferred stock, certain other instruments,
limited amounts of subordinated debt and the loan and lease loss allowance. Not
more than 25% of qualifying Tier 1 capital may consist of trust preferred
securities. In order to be well-capitalized, a bank holding company must have a
minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-adjusted assets of 6%. The Federal
Reserve Board also requires SVB Financial and Silicon Valley Bank to maintain a
minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to total average assets, referred to as
the Tier 1 leverage ratio. For a bank holding company or a bank that meets
certain specified criteria, including those in the highest of the five
categories used by regulators to rate


banking organizations, the
minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio is 3%. All other institutions are required
to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 3% plus an additional cushion
of 100 to 200 basis points (or at least 5% to be well-capitalized). In addition
to these requirements, the Federal Reserve Board may set individual minimum
capital requirements for specific institutions at rates substantially above the
minimum guidelines and ratios. Under certain circumstances, SVB Financial must
file written notice with, and obtain approval from, the Federal Reserve Board
prior to purchasing or redeeming its equity securities. See Item 1.
Business—Supervision and Regulation—Prompt Corrective Action and Other
Enforcement Mechanisms for additional discussion of capital ratios.

The ability of SVB Financial, like other bank holding
companies, to continue to include its outstanding trust preferred securities in
Tier 1 capital has been made the subject of some doubt due to the issuance by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in January 2003 of
Interpretation No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIE),”
(FIN 46) and in May 2003 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,” although the Federal Reserve
Board announced in July 2003 that qualifying trust preferred securities
will continue to be treated as Tier 1 capital until notice is given to the
contrary.

SVB Financial and Silicon Valley Bank are also subject
to rules that govern the regulatory capital treatment of equity
investments in non-financial companies made on or after March 13, 2000 and
held under certain specified legal authorities by a bank or bank holding
company. Silicon Valley Bank does not currently hold any such equity
investments. Under the rules, these equity investments will be subject to a
separate capital charge that will reduce a bank holding company’s Tier 1
capital and, correspondingly, will remove these assets from being taken into
consideration in establishing a bank holding company’s required capital ratios
discussed above.

The rules provide for the following incremental
Tier 1 capital charges: 8% of the adjusted carrying value of the portion
of such aggregate investments that are up to 15% of Tier 1 capital; 12% of
the adjusted carrying value of the portion of such aggregate investments that
are between 15% and 25% of Tier 1 capital; and 25% of the adjusted
carrying value of the portion of such aggregate investments that exceed 25% of
Tier 1 capital. The rules normally do not apply to equity warrants
acquired by a bank for making a loan or to equity securities that are acquired
in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted and that are held and divested
in accordance with applicable law.

The federal banking agencies have also adopted a joint
agency policy statement which provides that the adequacy and effectiveness of a
bank’s interest rate risk management process and the level of its interest rate
exposures are critical factors in the evaluation of the bank’s capital
adequacy. A bank with material weaknesses in its interest rate risk management
process or high levels of interest rate exposure relative to its capital will
be directed by the federal banking agencies to take corrective actions.
Financial institutions that have substantial amounts of their assets
concentrated in high-risk loans or non-traditional banking activities and who
fail to adequately manage these risks may be required to set aside capital in
excess of the regulatory minimums.

The capital ratios of SVB
Financial and Silicon Valley Bank, respectively, exceeded the well-capitalized
requirements, as defined above, at December 31, 2005. See Item 8.
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 20.
Regulatory Matters for the capital ratios of SVB Financial and Silicon Valley
Bank as of December 31, 2005.

Regulation of
Silicon Valley Bank

Silicon Valley Bank is a
California-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. Silicon
Valley Bank is subject to primary supervision, periodic examination and
regulation by the California Department of Financial Institutions and the
Federal Reserve Board. If, as a result of an


examination
of Silicon Valley Bank, the Federal Reserve Board should determine that the
financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects,
management, liquidity, or other aspects of Silicon Valley Bank’s operations are
unsatisfactory, or that Silicon Valley Bank or its management is violating or
has violated any law or regulation, various remedies are available to the
Federal Reserve Board. Such remedies include the power to enjoin “unsafe or
unsound” practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions
resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that
can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in capital, to restrict the
growth of Silicon Valley Bank, to assess civil monetary penalties, to remove
officers and directors, and ultimately to terminate Silicon Valley Bank’s
deposit insurance, which for a California-chartered bank would result in a
revocation of  Silicon Valley Bank’s
charter. The California Department of Financial Institutions has many of the
same remedial powers. Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of
the State of California and the United States affect the operations of Silicon
Valley Bank. State and federal statues and regulations relate to many aspects
of Silicon Valley Bank’s operations, including reserves against deposits,
ownership of deposit accounts, interest rates payable on deposits, loans,
investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends, locations of
branch offices, and capital requirements. Further, Silicon Valley Bank is
required to maintain certain levels of capital. (See Regulatory Capital,
above.) The GLB Act changed the powers of national banks and their
subsidiaries, and made similar changes in the powers of state bank
subsidiaries. The GLB Act permits a national bank to underwrite, deal in, and
purchase state and local revenue bonds. It also allows a subsidiary of a
national bank to engage in financial activities that the bank can not, except
for general insurance underwriting and real estate development and investment.
In order for a subsidiary to engage in new financial activities, the national
bank and its depository institution affiliates must be well-capitalized; have
at least “satisfactory” general, managerial, and CRA examination ratings; and
meet other qualification requirements relating to total assets, subordinated
debt, capital, risk management, and affiliate transactions. Subsidiaries of
state banks can exercise the same powers as national bank subsidiaries if they
satisfy the same qualifying rules that apply to national banks. For state
banks, such as Silicon Valley Bank, that are members of the Federal Reserve
System, prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required before they can
create a subsidiary to capitalize on the additional financial activities
empowered by the GLB Act.

Restrictions on
Dividends

SVB Financial’s ability to
pay cash dividends is limited by generally applicable Delaware corporation law
limits. In addition, SVB Financial is a legal entity separate and distinct from
Silicon Valley Bank, and there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the
amount of dividends that may be paid to SVB Financial by Silicon Valley Bank.
During 2005, 2004, and 2003, Silicon Valley Bank paid dividends of $0.0 million,
$25.0 million, and $51.0 million, respectively, to SVB Financial. However, a
part of the dividends paid in 2003 and in 2004 were in excess of the amount
permitted under the California State Department of Financial Institutions (“DFI”)
guidelines. Therefore SVB Financial was required by the DFI to return to
Silicon Valley Bank a portion the 2003 dividend and the 2004 dividend. The
total amount returned in early 2005 totaled $28.4 million. At December 31,
2005, under these regulatory restrictions, the remaining amount available for
payment of dividends to SVB Financial by Silicon Valley Bank totaled $95.0
million. The Federal Reserve Board and the California Commissioner of Financial
Institutions (the Commissioner) have the authority to prohibit Silicon Valley
Bank from engaging in activities that, in their opinion, constitute unsafe or
unsound practices in conducting its business. Depending upon the financial
condition of Silicon Valley Bank and other factors, the regulators could assert
that the payment of dividends or other payments might, under some
circumstances, be an unsafe or unsound practice. If Silicon Valley Bank fails
to comply with its minimum capital requirements, its regulators could restrict
its ability to pay dividends using prompt corrective action or other
enforcement powers. The Commissioner may impose similar limitations on the
conduct of California-chartered banks. See Item 8. Consolidated


Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 20. Regulatory Matters for further
discussion on dividend restrictions.

Transactions with
Affiliates

Transactions between
Silicon Valley Bank and its operating subsidiaries (including SVB Securities, Inc.;
SVB Asset Management; Woodside Asset Management; SVB Europe Advisors Private
Limited; and SVB India Advisors Pvt. Ltd.) and Silicon Valley Bank’s affiliates
(including but not limited to, SVB Financial Group; SVB Alliant; and SVB
Alliant Europe Limited) are subject to restrictions imposed by federal and
state law. These restrictions prevent SVB Financial and other affiliates from
borrowing from, or entering into other credit transactions with, Silicon Valley
Bank or its operating subsidiaries unless the loans or other credit
transactions are secured by specified amounts of collateral. All such loans and
credit transactions and other “covered transactions” by Silicon Valley Bank and
its operating subsidiaries with any one affiliate are limited, in the
aggregate, to 10% of Silicon Valley Bank’s capital and surplus; and all such
loans and credit transactions and other “covered transactions” by Silicon
Valley Bank and its operating subsidiaries with all affiliates are limited, in
the aggregate, to 20% of Silicon Valley Bank’s capital and surplus. For this purpose,
a “covered transaction” generally includes, among other things, a loan or
extension of credit to an affiliate; a purchase of or investment in securities
issued by an affiliate; a purchase of assets from an affiliate; the acceptance
of a security issued by an affiliate as collateral for an extension of credit
to any borrower; and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of
credit on behalf of an affiliate. A company that is a direct or indirect
subsidiary of  Silicon Valley Bank would
not be considered to be an “affiliate” of Silicon Valley Bank or its operating
subsidiaries unless it fell into one of certain categories, such as a “financial
subsidiary” authorized under the GLB Act. In addition, Silicon Valley Bank and
its operating subsidiaries generally may not purchase a low-quality asset from
an affiliate. Moreover, covered transactions and other specified transactions
by Silicon Valley Bank and its operating subsidiaries with an affiliate must be
on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking
practices. Silicon Valley Bank and its operating subsidiaries generally may
engage in transactions with affiliates only on terms and under circumstances,
including credit standards, that are substantially the same, or at least as
favorable to the Bank or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.

Prompt Corrective
Action and Other Enforcement Mechanisms

Federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take
corrective and other supervisory action against an insured bank and its holding
company. Federal laws require each federal banking agency to take prompt
corrective action to resolve the problems of insured banks. Each federal
banking agency has issued regulations defining five categories in which an
insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its
capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,
significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.

Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is
classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may
be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the
appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing,
determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound
practice, warrants such treatment. At each successive lower-capital category,
an insured bank is subject to more restrictions, including restrictions on the
bank’s activities, operational practices or the ability to pay dividends.
However, the federal banking agencies may not treat an institution as
critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratios actually warrant such
treatment.

In addition to measures
taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, bank holding companies and
insured banks may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal
regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for
violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the
agency or term of a written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may


include
the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank; the issuance of a
cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the termination of the
bank’s deposit insurance; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the
issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal
agreements; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers,
directors, and other institution-affiliated parties; and the enforcement of
such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial
determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not
granted.

Safety and
Soundness Guidelines

The federal banking
agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing
potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired. The
guidelines establish operational and managerial standards relating to: (1) internal
controls, information systems, and internal audit systems; (2) loan
documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest-rate exposure; (5) asset
growth and asset quality; and (6) compensation, fees, and benefits. In
addition, the federal banking agencies have adopted safety and soundness
guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to
ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and
reserves.

Premiums for
Deposit Insurance

Silicon Valley Bank’s deposit accounts are insured by
the Bank Insurance Fund, as administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, up to the maximum permitted by law. The FDIC may assess premiums
to maintain a sufficient fund balance. The amount charged is based on the
capital level of an institution and on a supervisory assessment based upon the
results of examination findings by the institution’s primary federal regulator
and other information deemed relevant by the FDIC to the institution’s financial
condition and the risk posed to the Bank Insurance Fund. As of December 31,
2005, the FDIC’s semi-annual assessment for the insurance of BIF deposits
ranged from zero (0) to twenty seven (27) cents per $100 of insured deposits.
The FDIC may increase or decrease the premium rate on a semi-annual basis. As
of December 31, 2005, Silicon Valley Bank’s assessment rate was zero.

Silicon Valley Bank is
also required to pay an annual assessment of approximately six (6) cents
per $100 of insured deposits toward the retirement of U.S. government-issued
financing corporation bonds.

Community
Reinvestment Act (CRA) and Fair Lending

Silicon Valley Bank is
subject to a variety of fair lending laws and reporting obligations, including
the CRA. The CRA generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate
the record of a bank in meeting the credit needs of its local communities,
including low- to moderate-income neighborhoods. In November 2003, the
Federal Reserve Board rated Silicon Valley Bank “satisfactory” in complying
with its CRA obligations. A bank can become subject to substantial penalties
and corrective measures for any violation of fair lending laws. When regulating
and supervising other activities or assessing whether to approve certain
applications, the federal banking agencies may consider a bank’s record of
compliance with such laws and CRA obligations.

Privacy

The GLB Act imposed customer privacy requirements on
any company engaged in financial activities. Under these requirements, a
financial company is required to protect the security and confidentiality of
customers’ non-public, personal information. For customers who obtain a
financial product, such as a loan, for personal, family, or household purposes,
a financial company is required to disclose its privacy policy to at the time
the relationship is established and annually thereafter. The financial company
must also disclose its policies concerning the sharing of the customer’s
non-public, personal information with


affiliates and third
parties. If an exemption is not available, a financial company must provide
consumers with a notice of its information-sharing practices that allows the
consumer to reject the disclosure of its non-public, personal information to
third parties. Third parties that receive such information are subject to the
same restrictions as the financial company on the reuse of the information.
Finally, a financial company is prohibited from disclosing an account number or
similar item to a third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing,
or marketing through electronic mail. Financial companies were required to be
in compliance with these consumer privacy requirements no later than July 1,
2001.

The California Financial
Information Privacy Act (SB1) became effective on July 1, 2004, and
applies to financial institutions doing business in the State of California.
SB1 tightens existing federal restrictions on the sharing of consumers’
non-public personal information with affiliates and nonaffiliated third
parties.

Silicon
Valley Bank has written policies with regard to the sharing of consumers’
non-public, personal information. Our policies comply with both federal and
California rules applicable to the security and confidentiality of
consumers’ non-public, personal information.

USA Patriot Act of

As part of the Uniting and Strengthening America by
Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of
2001 (the USA Patriot Act), Congress adopted the International Money Laundering
Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (“IMLAFATA”). IMLAFATA
amended the Bank Secrecy Act and adopted certain additional measures that
established or increased already existing obligations of financial
institutions, including Silicon Valley Bank, to identify their customers, watch
for and report upon suspicious transactions, respond to requests for
information by federal banking regulatory authorities and law enforcement
agencies, and share information with other financial institutions. The U.S.
Secretary of the Treasury has adopted several regulations to implement these
provisions. Pursuant to certain of these
regulations, Silicon Valley Bank may not establish, maintain, administer, or
manage a correspondent account in the United States for, or on behalf of, a
foreign shell bank. In addition, IMLAFATA expands the circumstances
under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited. IMLAFATA also amended the
BHC Act and the Bank Merger Act to require the federal banking regulatory
authorities to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s
anti-money laundering activities when reviewing an application to expand
operations. Silicon Valley Bank has in place a Bank Secrecy Act compliance
program.

Regulation of
Certain Subsidiaries

Two of our subsidiaries, SVB Alliant and SVB
Securities, are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and members of the
NASD and as such are subject to regulation by the NASD and the SEC. Our
investment advisory subsidiaries, Woodside Asset Management, Inc., and SVB
Asset Management, are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940, as amended, and are subject to that act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to
Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
Act), which is designed to measure the general financial condition and
liquidity of a broker-dealer. Under this rule, our broker-dealer subsidiaries
are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet broker-dealers’
continuing commitments to customers and others. Under certain circumstances,
this rule could limit the ability of SVB Financial to withdraw capital from SVB
Alliant and of Silicon Valley Bank to withdraw capital from SVB Securities.


As broker-dealers, SVB
Alliant and SVB Securities are also subject to other regulations covering the
operations of their respective businesses, including sales, and with respect to
SVB Securities, trading practices and use of client funds and securities; and
conduct of directors, officers, and employees. Broker-dealers are also subject
to regulation by state securities administrators in the states where they do
business. Violations of the stringent regulations governing the actions of a
broker-dealer can result in the revocation of broker-dealer licenses; the
imposition of censures or fines; the issuance of cease and desist orders; and
the suspension or expulsion from the securities business of a firm, its
officers, or its employees. The SEC and the NASD, in particular, emphasize the
need for supervision and control by broker-dealers of their employees.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Our business faces significant risks, including
credit, market/liquidity, operational, legal/regulatory, and
strategic/reputation risks. The factors described below may not be the only
risks we face, and are not intended to serve as a comprehensive listing or be
applicable only to the category of risk under which they are disclosed. The
risks described below are generally applicable to more than one of the
following categories of risks. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or
that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations.
If any of the events or circumstances described in the following factors
actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations
could suffer.

Credit
Risks

If a significant
number of clients fail to perform under their loans, our business,
profitability, and financial condition would be adversely affected.

As a lender, the largest
risk we face is the possibility that a significant number of our client
borrowers will fail to pay their loans when due. If borrower defaults cause
losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses, it could have an adverse
effect on our business, profitability, and financial condition. We have
established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and
other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment
of loan losses are dependent to a great extent on our experience and judgment.
We cannot assure you that our allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to
absorb future loan losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business,
profitability, or financial condition.

Because of the
credit profile of our loan portfolio, our levels of nonperforming assets and
charge-offs can be volatile, and we may need to make material provisions for
loan losses in any period, which could reduce net income or increase net losses
in that period.

Our loan portfolio has a
credit profile different from that of most other banking companies. Many of our
loans are made to companies in the early stages of development with negative
cash flow and no established record of profitable operations. In many cases,
repayment of the loan is dependent upon receipt of additional equity financing
from venture capitalists or others. Collateral for many of the loans often
includes intellectual property, which is difficult to value and may not be
readily salable in the case of default. Because of the intense competition and
rapid technological change that characterizes the


companies
in our technology and life science industry sectors, a borrower’s financial
position can deteriorate rapidly. We also make loans that are larger, relative
to the revenues of the borrower, than those made by traditional small business
lenders, so the impact of any single borrower default may be more significant
to us. Because of these characteristics, our level of nonperforming loans and
loan charge-offs can be volatile and can vary materially from period to period.
Changes in our level of nonperforming loans may require us to make material
provisions for loan losses in any period, which could reduce our net income or
cause net losses in that period.

Market/Liquidity
Risks

Our current level
of interest rate spread may decline in the future. Any material reduction in
our interest spread could have a material impact on our business and
profitability.

A major portion of our net
income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the
interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and
other borrowings, and the interest rates and fees we receive on
interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to our clients and interest
rates we receive on securities held in our investment portfolio. Interest rates
are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, such as inflation,
recession, global economic disruptions, unemployment and the fiscal and
monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. In addition,
legislative changes could affect the manner in which we pay interest on
deposits or other liabilities. For example, Congress has for many years debated
repealing a law that prohibits banks from paying interest rates on checking accounts.
If this law were to be repealed, we would be subject to competitive pressure to
pay interest on our clients’ checking accounts, which would negatively affect
our interest rate spread. Any material decline in our interest rate spread
would have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.
Additionally, a portion of our loan fee income, a component of loan interest
income, is predicated on the receipt of warrant assets. If we fail to continue
to receive warrant assets our future interest margin may decline.

Our business is
dependent upon access to funds on attractive terms.

We derive our net interest
income through lending or investing capital on terms that provide returns in
excess of our costs for obtaining that capital. As a result, our credit ratings
are important to our business. A reduction in our credit ratings could
adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing
costs (or trigger obligations under certain existing borrowings and other
contracts), or increase the interest rates we pay our depositors. Further, our
credit ratings and the terms upon which we have access to capital may be
influenced by circumstances beyond our control, such as overall trends in the
general market environment, perceptions about our creditworthiness or market
conditions in the industries in which we focus.

Warrant, venture
capital fund, and direct equity investment portfolio gains or losses depend
upon the performance of the portfolio investments and the general condition of
the public equity markets, which is uncertain.

We have historically
obtained rights to acquire stock, in the form of equity warrants, in certain
clients as part of negotiated credit facilities and for other services. In
future periods we may not be able to ultimately realize gains from the sale of
securities to third parties related to the exercise of warrants, or our
realized gains may be materially less than the current level of fair value of
derivative equity warrant assets and unrealized gains disclosed in this filing.
We also have made investments in venture capital funds as well as direct equity
investments in companies. The timing and amount of income, if any, from the
disposition of client warrants, venture capital funds, and direct equity investments
typically depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of
the underlying portfolio companies, investor demand for initial public
offerings, fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock of
these


companies,
levels of mergers and acquisitions activity, and legal and contractual
restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities. In addition, our
investments in venture capital funds and direct equity investments have lost
value and could continue to lose value or become worthless, which would reduce
our net income or could cause a net loss in any period. All of these factors
are difficult to predict, particularly in the current economic environment.
Additionally, due to the nature of investing in private equity venture-backed
technology and life science companies, it is likely that additional investments
within our existing portfolio will become impaired. However, we are not in a
position to know at the present time which specific investments, if any, are
likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments.
Therefore, we cannot predict future investment gains or losses with any degree
of accuracy, and any gains or losses are likely to vary materially from period
to period.

Public equity
offerings and mergers and acquisitions involving our clients can cause loans to
be paid off early, which could adversely affect our business and profitability.

While an active market for
public equity offerings and mergers and acquisitions generally has positive
implications for our business, one negative consequence is that our clients may
pay off or reduce their loans with us if they complete a public equity offering
or are acquired or merge with another company. Any significant reduction in our
outstanding loans could have a material adverse effect on our business and
profitability.

Operational Risks

If we fail to
retain our key employees, our growth and profitability could be adversely
affected.

We rely on experienced
client relationship managers and on officers and employees with strong
relationships with the venture capital community to generate new business. If a
significant number of these employees were to leave us, our growth and
profitability could be adversely affected. We believe that our employees
frequently have opportunities for alternative employment with competing
financial institutions and with our clients.

Changes to our
employee compensation structure could adversely affect our results of
operations and cash flows, as well as our ability to attract, recruit, and
retain certain key employees.

We account for our
employee stock options in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
and related interpretations, which provide that any compensation expense
relative to employee stock options be measured based on the intrinsic value of
the stock options. As a result, when options are granted at fair market value
of the underlying stock on the date of grant, as is our practice, we incur no
compensation expense. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” which is a revision of SFAS No. 123
and supersedes APB No. 25. SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to record
compensation expense for all employee share based payments. Such expense will
have a material impact on our results of operations. In October 2004, in
an effort to align our option grant rate to that of other financial
institutions similar to us, we significantly decreased the number of shares
subject to options granted to our employees on a prospective basis. We may in
the future consider taking other actions to modify employee compensation
structures, such as granting cash compensation or other forms of equity
compensation. Our decision to reduce the number of option shares to be granted
on a prospective basis, and any other future changes we may adopt in our
employee compensation structures, could adversely affect our results of
operations and cash flows, as well as our ability to attract, recruit, and
retain certain key employees.


We could be liable
for breaches of security in our online banking services. Fear of security
breaches could limit the growth of our online services.

We offer various Internet-based services to our
clients, including online banking services. The secure transmission of
confidential information over the Internet is essential to maintain our
clients’ confidence in our online services. Advances in computer capabilities,
new discoveries, or other developments could result in a compromise or breach
of the technology we use to protect client transaction data. Although we have
developed systems and processes that are designed to prevent security breaches
and periodically test our security, failure to mitigate breaches of security
could adversely affect our ability to offer and grow our online services and
could harm our business.

People generally are
concerned with security and privacy on the Internet and any publicized security
problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet as a means of conducting
commercial transactions. Our ability to provide financial services over the
Internet would be severely impeded if clients became unwilling to transmit
confidential information online. As a result, our operations and financial
condition could be adversely affected.

Business
interruptions due to natural disasters and other events beyond our control can
adversely affect our business.

Our operations can be subject to natural disasters and
other events beyond our control, such as earthquakes, fires, power failures,
telecommunication loss, terrorist attacks, and acts of war. Our corporate
headquarters and a portion of our critical business offices are located in
California near major earthquake faults. Such events of disaster, whether
natural or manmade, could cause severe destruction or interruption to our
operations and as a result, our business could suffer serious harm.

To mitigate these risks we
have begun a phased business continuity program, with initial capabilities
available in 2005 and additional capabilities to be implemented throughout
2006. Additionally, we announced in January 2006 that we expected to open
a support and back-operations facility in Salt Lake City, Utah during the first
half of 2006. The facility is part of our business continuity strategy to ensure
the continuous availability of critical client operations in the event of an
unforeseen disaster. We also have a back-up data center in Phoenix, Arizona.
Nonetheless, there is no assurance that our business continuity program can
adequately mitigate the risks of such business interruptions.

We rely on other
companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.

Third parties provide key
components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections and
network access. Any disruption in internet, network access or other voice or
data communication services provided by these third parties or any failure of
these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely
affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and
otherwise to conduct our business. Technological or financial difficulties of a
third party service provider could adversely affect our business to the extent
those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services
provided by that party.

We face risks
associated with the ability of our information technology systems and our
processes to effectively support our growth.

We have a complex set of
information technology systems and processes to support our business. Our systems
consist of multiple information systems that complicate our processing,
reporting and analysis of our business transactions and business information.
Although we have continuously improved our business systems and processes, as
our business grows larger and more complex, our current systems and processes
will likely not be able to support the growth effectively. In 2006 and forward,
there will be a more significant focus towards improving our systems and
processes in order to increase our efficiency, including


upgrading
and consolidating our information systems and improving and automating, where
appropriate, our processes. There is no assurance that we can effectively and
timely improve our systems and processes to meet all of our business needs
efficiently.

We depend on the
accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.

In deciding whether to
extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and
counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of
customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other
financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and
counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and,
with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For
example, in deciding whether to extend credit, we may assume that a customer’s
audited financial statements conform with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
customer. We also may rely on the audit report covering those financial
statements. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively
affected by relying on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or
that are materially misleading.

Our accounting
policies and methods are key to how we report our financial condition and
results of operations. They may require management to make estimates about
matters that are uncertain.

Our accounting policies
and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition
and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting
and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with
GAAP and reflect management’s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report
our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the
accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of
which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in our
reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a
different alternative.

Changes in
accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.

From time to time, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changes the financial accounting
and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial
statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how
we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some
cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively,
resulting in our restating prior period financial statements.

If we fail to
maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we
may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result,
current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial
reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.

Our management has determined that as of
December 31, 2005, we did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in “Internal Control—Integrated
Framework” as a result of identified material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting. Specifically, we did not have adequately
designed internal controls in our financial reporting process related to the
selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles in that
(a) accounting policies, procedures and practices were not consistently
developed, maintained or updated in a manner ensuring that financial statements
were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,
(b) these policies and procedures were not designed to consistently ensure
the preparation and retention of adequate documentation to support key
judgments made in connection with the selection and application of significant
accounting policies within our financial reporting process and (c) our
policies and procedures


did not consistently
provide for effective analysis, implementation, and documentation of new
accounting pronouncements. In addition, we did not maintain sufficient levels
of appropriately qualified and trained personnel in our financial reporting
processes resulting in our inability to establish internal control over
financial reporting policies and procedures related to (1) the timely
preparation of comprehensive documentation supporting management’s analysis of
the appropriate accounting treatment for warrant derivatives or other
non-routine or complex transactions, and (2) the review of such
documentation by qualified internal staff, assisted by external advisors as
deemed necessary, to determine our completeness and the propriety of our
conclusions. For a detailed description of these material weaknesses and our
remediation efforts and plans, see Part II, Items 9A and 9B. These control
deficiencies resulted in material errors in our financial reporting which
resulted in a restatement of our financial statements for the years 2002, 2003
and 2004. This restatement process took five months to complete, required substantial
resources and personnel, and included a comprehensive review of our financial
statements and accounting practices by our auditors. However, we have not yet
fully remediated these material weaknesses.

In response to these material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting, we are implementing additional controls and
procedures and are incurring additional related expenses. We cannot be certain
that the measures we have taken to date and are planning to take will
sufficiently and satisfactorily remediate the identified material weaknesses in
full. Furthermore, we intend to continue improving our internal control over
financial reporting and the implementation and testing of these efforts could
result in increased cost and could divert management attention away from
operating our business.

If we are unable to
remediate the identified material weaknesses discussed above, or if additional
material weaknesses are identified in our internal control over financial
reporting, our management will be unable to report favorably as to the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and/or our
disclosure controls and procedures, and we could be required to further
implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and potentially lose
investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports,
which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject
us to litigation.

Legal/Regulatory Risks

We are subject to
extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and impose
financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business.

SVB Financial, Silicon
Valley Bank, and their subsidiaries are extensively regulated under federal and
state law. These regulations are intended primarily for the protection of
depositors, other clients, and the deposit insurance fund—not for the benefit
of stockholders or security holders. Federal and state laws and regulations
limit or otherwise affect the activities in which SVB Financial, Silicon Valley
Bank, and their subsidiaries may engage. A change in the applicable statutes,
regulations, or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business
and that of our subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways including by
placing limitations on the types of financial services and products we may
offer or increasing the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial
services and products. In addition, SVB Financial, Silicon Valley Bank, and
their subsidiaries are required to maintain certain minimum levels of capital.
Federal and state banking regulators possess broad powers to take supervisory
action, as they deem appropriate, with respect to SVB Financial and Silicon
Valley Bank. SVB Alliant and SVB Securities, both broker-dealer subsidiaries,
are regulated by the SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(NASD). Violations of the stringent regulations governing the actions of a
broker-dealer can result in the revocation of broker-dealer licenses, the
imposition of censures or fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders, and
the suspension or expulsion from the securities business of a firm, its
officers or employees. Supervisory actions can result in higher capital
requirements, higher insurance premiums, and limitations on the activities of
SVB Financial, Silicon Valley Bank or their subsidiaries. These supervisory
actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.
Any increased or unanticipated regulatory


scrutiny
or review may impact the conduct of our business and could have a material
adverse effect on our business and profitability, since existing resources
would be detracted from the current conduct of business and reprioritized to
resolve any such review. For example, the scope and degree of regulatory
scrutiny of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/anti-money laundering compliance have
expanded significantly following the events of September 11, 2001 and as a
result we have been focusing resources to understand our inherent BSA risk and
to document our compliance. We could also receive regulatory sanctions or be
subject to regulatory orders for any failure to comply with laws, regulations
or policies, which may damage our reputation.

SVB Financial
relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue.

SVB Financial is a
separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives
substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These
dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on SVB Financial’s
common and preferred stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various
federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that
our bank and certain of our nonbank subsidiaries may pay to SVB Financial.
Also, SVB Financial’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a
subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of
the subsidiary’s creditors.

Strategic/Reputation Risks

Our business
reputation is important and any damage to it can have a material adverse effect
on our business.

Our reputation is very
important to sustain our business, as we rely on our relationships with our
current, former and potential clients and stockholders, the venture capital and
private equity community and the industries in which we serve. Any damage to
our reputation, such as regulatory enforcement actions, downgrade of ratings,
loss of customers, late filings of SEC reports and potential delisting actions,
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Adverse changes in
domestic or global economic conditions, especially in the technology sector and
particularly in California, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, growth, and profitability.

If conditions deteriorate
in the domestic or global economy, especially in the technology, life science,
private equity, and premium wine industry niches, our business, growth, and
profitability are likely to be materially adversely affected. A global or U.S.
economic slowdown would harm many of our clients. Our clients may be
particularly sensitive to disruptions in the growth of the technology sector of
the U.S. economy. In addition, a substantial number of our clients are
geographically concentrated in California, and adverse economic conditions in
California could harm the businesses of a disproportionate number of our
clients. To the extent that our clients’ underlying businesses are harmed, they
are more likely to default on their loans.

Decreases in the
amount of equity capital available to start-up and emerging-growth companies
could adversely affect our business, profitability, and growth prospects.

Our strategy has focused on providing banking products
and services to emerging-growth and corporate technology companies receiving
financial support from sophisticated investors, including venture capitalists, “angels,”
and corporate investors. In some cases, our lending credit decision is based on
our analysis of the likelihood that our venture capital or angel-backed client
will receive a second or third round of equity infusion from investors. If the
amount of capital available to such companies decreases, it is likely that the
number of new clients and investor financial support to our existing borrowers
could decrease, which would have an adverse effect on our business,
profitability and growth prospects.


Among the factors that
have and could in the future affect the amount of capital available to startup
and emerging-growth companies are the receptivity of the capital markets to
initial public offerings or mergers and acquisitions of companies within our
technology and life science industry sectors, the availability and return on
alternative investments, and general economic conditions in the technology and
life science industries. Reduced capital markets valuations could reduce the
amount of capital available to startup and emerging-growth companies, including
companies within our technology and life science industry sectors.

We cannot assure
that we will be able to maintain our historical levels of profitability in the
face of sustained competitive pressures.

Other banks and specialty
and diversified financial services companies, many of which are larger and have
more capital than we do, offer lending, leasing, other financial products and advisory
services to our client base. In some cases, our competitors focus their
marketing on our industry sectors and seek to increase their lending and other
financial relationships with technology companies, early stage growth companies
or special industries such as wineries. In other cases, our competitors may
offer a broader range of financial products to our clients. When new
competitors seek to enter one of our markets, or when existing market
participants seek to increase their market share, they sometimes undercut the
pricing and/or credit terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely
affect our market share. Our pricing and credit terms could deteriorate if we
act to meet these competitive challenges.

We face risks in
connection with completed or potential acquisitions.

We completed one acquisition in each of 2002 and 2001
and, if appropriate opportunities present themselves, we intend to acquire
businesses, technologies, services or products that we believe are strategic.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, negotiate or
finance future acquisitions successfully or integrate such acquisitions with
our current business.

Future acquisitions could result in potentially
dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, and/or
contingent liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, and/or financial condition. Any such future
acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services, or products might
require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be
available on terms favorable to us, or at all; and such financing, if
available, might be dilutive.

Upon completion of an acquisition, we are faced with
the challenges of integrating the operations, services, products, personnel,
and systems of acquired companies into our business, which may divert
management’s attention from ongoing business operations. In addition,
acquisitions of new businesses may subject us to regulatory scrutiny. We cannot
assure that we will be successful in integrating any acquired business
effectively into the operations of our business. Moreover, there can be no
assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will be realized.

The success of our
acquisitions is dependent on the continued employment of several key employees.
If acquired businesses do not meet projected revenue targets, or if certain key
employees were to leave the businesses, we could conclude that the value of the
businesses has decreased and that the related goodwill has been impaired. If we
were to conclude that goodwill has been impaired that conclusion would result
in an impairment of goodwill charge to us, which would adversely affect our
results of operations.

We face risks
associated with international operations.

A component of our
strategy is to expand internationally on a limited basis, which requires
management’s attention and resources. We already opened offices in the UK,
India and China and plan to expand our operations in those locations and are
exploring adding other locations. In addition to the uncertainty regarding our
ability to generate revenues from foreign operations and to expand our


international
presence, there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international
basis, including, among others, legal and regulatory requirements, legal
uncertainty regarding liability, tariffs, and other trade barriers,
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, differing technology
standards or customer requirements, requirements or restrictions relating to
making foreign direct investments, difficulties associated with repatriating
cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner, longer payment cycles,
different accounting practices, problems in collecting loan or other types of
payments, political and economic instability, seasonal reductions in business
activity, changes in tax laws and potentially adverse tax consequences, any of
which could adversely affect the success of our international operations. In
addition, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing
economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by
regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although
we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these
laws, our employees and agents may take actions in violation of our policies. Any
such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material
adverse effect on our business. To the extent we continue to expand our
international operations and have additional portions of our international
revenues denominated in foreign currencies, we could become subject to
increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Since
we have limited experience in globalizing our service, there can be no
assurance that we will be successful in expanding into international markets or
that one or more of the factors discussed above will not have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and/or financial
condition.

Maintaining or
increasing our market share depends on market acceptance of new products and
services.

Our success depends, in
part, upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry
standards and client demands. There is increasing pressure on financial
services companies to provide products and services at lower prices. In
addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including Internet-based
services, could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt
our existing products or services. A failure to achieve market acceptance of
any new products we introduce, or a failure to introduce products that the
market may demand, could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability,
or growth prospects.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters facility consists of three
buildings and is located at 3003 Tasman Drive, Santa Clara, California. On September 15,
2004, we renegotiated the lease related to our corporate headquarters facility,
which replaced the original lease, dated March 8, 1995. The new lease
covers two buildings, comprising approximately 157,000 square feet of space,
which we occupied under the previous lease, as well as a third building,
comprising approximately 56,500 square feet of space, within the same facility
complex. The total square footage of the premises leased under the new lease
arrangement is approximately 213,500 square feet, which is approximately the
same square footage of our corporate headquarters under its previous leases.
The term of the new corporate headquarters lease began retroactively on August 1,
2004, and will end on September 30, 2014, unless terminated earlier.

We currently operate 27 regional offices in the United
States and three offices outside the United States. We operate throughout the
Silicon Valley with an office in Fremont, two offices in Santa Clara, an office
on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, and three offices in Palo Alto. Other regional
offices in California include Irvine, Los Angeles, Napa Valley, San Diego, San
Francisco, and Sonoma. Office locations outside of California within the United
States include: Phoenix, Arizona; Boulder, Colorado; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago,
Illinois; Boston, Massachusetts; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York, New York;
Durham, North


Carolina; Portland,
Oregon; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Vienna,
Northern Virginia; and Seattle, Washington. Our three foreign offices are
located in:  Bangalore, India; Shanghai,
China; and London, England. All of our properties are occupied under leases,
which expire at various dates through 2014, and in most instances include
options to renew or extend at market rates and terms. We also own leasehold
improvements, equipment, furniture, and fixtures at our offices, all of which
are used in our business activities.

Our Commercial Banking
operations principally operate out of our corporate headquarters in Santa
Clara, and the lending teams operate out of the various regional offices. SVB
Capital principally operates out of our office in Menlo Park, and SVB Alliant
out of one of the offices in Palo Alto. Our other businesses, including Global
Financial Services and Private Client Services, principally operate out of our
corporate headquarters in Santa Clara also.

Legal Proceedings

On May 24, 2001, Gateway Communications, Inc.
(Gateway) filed a lawsuit in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of Ohio (Western Division) naming the Bank as a defendant. Gateway
(the debtor in the bankruptcy case) alleges that the Bank’s actions in
connection with a loan resulted in Gateway’s bankruptcy, and seeks $20,000,000
in compensatory damages, punitive damages, interest and attorneys’ fees. On June 24,
2003, the Court dismissed four of the five counts in the complaint, including
the claim for punitive damages, leaving one breach of contract claim. We
believe that the sole remaining claim has no merit and intend to defend the
lawsuit vigorously. Thus, we have not accrued any amount related to potential
damages from this case as they are not considered probable and reasonably
estimable. The action is scheduled for trial in July 2006.

From time to time, we are
subject to legal claims and proceedings that arise in the normal course of our
business. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable,
based on information available to us, our review of such claims to date and
consultation with our outside counsel, we do not currently expect that the
ultimate costs to resolve these matters, if any, will have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity, consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

We have not paid cash
dividends on our common stock since 1992. Currently, we have no plan to pay
cash dividends on our common stock. The Company’s Board of Directors may,
periodically, evaluate the decision of paying cash dividends in the context of
our performance, general economic performance, and relevant tax and financial
parameters. Our ability to pay cash dividends is limited by generally
applicable corporate and banking laws and regulations. See Item 1.

Adoption of FIN 46R in December 2003 and SFAS No. 150
in May 2003 resulted in a change of classification of trust preferred securities
distribution expense from noninterest expense to interest expense on a
prospective basis. Additionally, the adoption of FIN 46R and SFAS No. 150
resulted in a change of classification of trust preferred securities from
noninterest bearing funding sources to interest-bearing liabilities on a
prospective basis. Prior to adoption of FIN 46R and SFAS No. 150, in
accordance with accounting rules in effect at that time, we recorded trust
preferred securities distribution expense as noninterest expense. On October 30,
2003, $50.0 million in cumulative 7.0% trust preferred securities were
issued through a newly formed special purpose trust, SVB Capital II. We
received $51.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of 7.0% junior
subordinated debentures to SVB Capital II. A portion of the net proceeds were
used to redeem the existing $40.0 million of 8.25% trust preferred
securities. Approximately $1.3 million of deferred issuance costs related
to redemption of the $40.0 million 8.25% trust preferred securities were
included in interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Management’s discussion and analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations below contain forward-looking statements.
These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are
subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially
because of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in
Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The following discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data

.

Overview of Company Operations

See Item I of Part I
above, “Business—General” for an overview of Company operations.

Critical Accounting Policies

The accompanying management’s discussion and analysis
of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have, been prepared in accordance with
GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. Management evaluates estimates on an ongoing basis. Management
bases its estimates on historical experiences and various other factors and
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. The financial impact of each estimate, to the extent
significant to financial results, is discussed in the applicable sections of
the management’s discussion and analysis.

Our critical accounting
policies are described below. Our senior management has discussed the
development, selection, and disclosure of these critical accounting policies
with our Audit Committee.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities

Our accounting for
investments in non-marketable equity securities depends on several factors,
including our level of ownership/control and the legal structure of our
subsidiary making the investment. As further described below, we base our
accounting for such securities on: (i) investment company fair value
accounting, (ii) equity method accounting, or (iii) cost method
accounting.

Investment
Company Fair Value

Our non-marketable
equity securities recorded pursuant to investment company fair value accounting
consist of our investments in the following funds:

·

Direct
equity venture fund, Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP, which makes equity
investments in privately held companies;

·

Funds
of funds, SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP, SVB Strategic Investors Fund II,
LP, and SVB Strategic Investors Fund III, LP, which make investments in venture
capital funds; and

·

Special
situation debt fund, Partners for Growth, LP, which provides financing to
companies in the form of structured loans and equity investments.


A

company fair value accounting is presented in the following table:

(1)

The general partner,
Silicon Valley BancVentures, Inc. is owned and controlled by SVB Financial
Group and has an ownership interest of 10.7% in Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP.
The limited partners do not have substantive participating or kick-out rights.
Therefore, Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP is consolidated and any gains or
losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the investments
are recorded as investment gains or losses in our consolidated net income.

(2)

The general partner of
SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP (SIF I), SVB Strategic Investors, LLC, is
owned and controlled by SVB Financial Group and has an ownership interest of
12.6%. The general partner of SVB Strategic Investors Fund II, LP (SIF II), SVB
Strategic Investors II, LLC, is owned and controlled by SVB Financial Group and
has an ownership interest of 8.6%. The general partner of SVB Strategic
Investors Fund III, LP (SIF III), SVB Strategic Investors III, LLC, is owned
and controlled by SVB Financial Group and has an ownership interest of 100.0%. The
limited partners of these funds do not have substantive participating or
kick-out rights. Therefore, SIF I, II, and III are consolidated and any
gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the
venture capital fund investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in
our consolidated net income.

(3)

The general partner of
Partners for Growth, LP, Partners for Growth, LLC, is not owned or controlled
by SVB Financial Group. The limited partners of this fund have substantive
kick-out rights by which the general partner may be removed without cause by
simple majority vote of the limited partners. SVB Financial has an ownership
interest of 50.01% in Partners for Growth, LP. Accordingly, the fund is
consolidated and any gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated
fair value of the investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in our
consolidated net income.

Under investment company
accounting, investments are carried at estimated fair value based on financial
information obtained from the funds’ respective general partner. We utilize the
most recent available financial information available from the investee’s
general partner, for instance, September 30, for our December 31
consolidated financial statements, adjusted for any contributions paid or
distributions received from the investment during the fourth quarter. The
valuations generally remain at cost until such time that there is significant
evidence of a change in value based upon consideration of the relevant market
conditions, offering prices, operating results, financial conditions, exit
strategies, and other pertinent information. Thus, any gains or losses
resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the investments


are
recorded as investment gains or losses in our consolidated net income. The
portion of any investment gains or losses attributable to the limited partners
is reflected as minority interest in net income (loss) of consolidated
affiliates and adjusts SVB Financial Group’s investment returns to reflect its
percentage ownership.

Equity
Method

Our equity method non-marketable equity securities
consist of an investment in a venture debt fund and several qualified
affordable housing tax credit funds.

The venture debt fund investment is in Gold Hill
Venture Lending 03, LP, which provides financing to privately-held companies in
the form of loans and equity investments. SVB Financial Group has direct and
indirect interest totaling 9.3% in Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP. Our total
interest in Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP exceeds the 3%-5% ownership
interest threshold established by EITF Topic D-46 for cost method
accounting. Accordingly, this limited partnership investment is accounted for
under the equity method. Thus, we recognize our proportionate share of the
results of operations of each equity method investee in its results of
operations.

We invest in several qualified affordable housing
projects, which provide us benefits in the form of tax credits. Under EITF 94-1,
“Accounting for Tax Benefits Resulting From Investments in Affordable Housing
Projects” we account for such investments under the equity method in accordance
with the provisions of the AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 78-9, “Accounting
for Investments in Real Estate Ventures.”

We review these
investments at least quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment.
Our review typically includes an analysis of facts and circumstances for each
investment, the expectations of the investment’s future cash flows and capital
needs, variability of its business and the company’s exit strategy. We reduce
our investment value when we consider declines in value to be other than
temporary. We recognize the estimated loss as a loss on investment securities,
a component of noninterest income.

Cost
Method

Our cost method
non-marketable equity securities and related accounting policies are described
as follows:

·

In
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18
“

The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock

” (APB No. 18), equity securities, such as
preferred or common stock in privately-held companies in which we hold an
ownership interest of less than 20% and in which we do not have the ability to
exercise significant influence over the investees’ operating and financial
policies, are accounted for under the cost method.

·

In
accordance with the provisions of Emerging Issue Task Force (EITF) Topic D-46,
“Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments” (EITF Topic D-46),
investments in limited partnerships in which we hold an ownership interest of
less than 5% and in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over the investees’ operating and financial policies, are accounted
for under the cost method. These
non-marketable equity securities include investments in venture capital
funds.

As stated above, we record these investments at cost
and recognize as income, distributions or returns received from net accumulated
earnings of the investee since the date of acquisition. Our share of net
accumulated earnings of the investee after the date of investment are
recognized in consolidated net income only to the extent distributed by the
investee. Distributions or returns received in excess of accumulated earnings
are considered a return of investment and are recorded as reductions in the
cost basis of the investment.


We review these assets at least quarterly for possible
other than temporary impairment. Our review typically includes an analysis of
facts and circumstances of each investment, the expectations of the investment’s
future cash flows and capital needs, variability of its business and the
company’s exit strategy. We reduce the investment value when we consider
declines in value to be other than temporary. We recognize the estimated loss
as a loss on investment securities, a component of noninterest income.

Gains or losses on cost method investment securities
that result from a portfolio company being acquired by a publicly traded
company are marked to market when the acquisition occurs. The resulting gains
or losses are recognized into consolidated net income on that date in
accordance with EITF No. 91-5, “Nonmonetary Exchange of Cost-Method
Investments”. Further fluctuations in the market value of these equity
securities, which are classified as available-for-sale securities, are excluded
from consolidated net income and are reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, (OCI), a component of
stockholders’ equity. Upon the sale of these equity securities to a third
party, gains and losses, which are measured from the acquisition value, are
recognized in our consolidated net income.

We consider our
non-marketable equity securities accounting policies to be critical because the
valuation of non-marketable equity securities is subject to management
judgment. The inherent uncertainty in the process of valuing equity securities
for which a ready market is unavailable may cause our estimated values of these
securities to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived
had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences could be
material. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results
of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the
carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment’s
carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.
For further information related to non-marketable equity securities for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, please refer to the table

Derivative Assets—Derivative Equity Warrants for
Shares of Privately- and Publicly-held Companies

Derivative equity warrant assets for shares of private
and public companies are recorded at fair value on the grant date and adjusted
to fair value on a quarterly basis through consolidated net income.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133
as amended, we account for equity warrant assets with net settlement terms in
certain private and public client companies as derivatives. In general,
derivative equity warrant assets that we hold entitle us to buy a specific
number of shares of stock at a specific price over a specific time period.

Certain warrants obtained by
us include contingent provisions which set the underlying number of shares or
strike price based upon certain future events. For example, the number of
shares exercisable for some warrants is contingent upon the related lending
facility, such as the extent of utilization of the facility, including draw
frequency or amount. Or, in some cases, the underlying strike price of some
warrants may be contingent upon the share price of a subsequent future round of
equity financing of the issuer. Our warrant agreements contain net share
settlement provisions, which permit the issuing company to deliver to us, upon
our exercise of the warrant, the amount of shares with a current fair value
equal to the net gain of the warrant agreement (sometimes described as a “cashless”
exercise). Because our
warrant agreements contain such net share settlement provisions, our equity
warrant assets are required to be accounted for as derivative instruments.

Under the accounting treatment required by SFAS No. 133,
equity warrant assets in private and public companies which include net share
settlement provisions held by SVB Financial Group, are recorded at fair value
and are classified as derivative assets, a component of Other assets, on SVB
Financial Group’s balance sheet at the time they are obtained.

The grant date fair values of these equity warrant
assets are deemed to be loan fees and are required to be recognized as an
adjustment of loan yield through loan interest income, as prescribed by SFAS


No. 91. Similar to
other loan fees, the yield adjustment related to grant date fair value of
equity warrant assets, received directly in connection with the issuance of a
credit facility, is recognized over the life of that credit facility.

Any changes from the grant date fair value of
derivative equity warrant assets will be recognized as increases or decreases
to other assets on our balance sheet and as net gains or losses on derivative
investments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.
When a portfolio company completes an initial public offering on a publicly
reported market or is acquired by a publicly traded company, we may exercise
these equity warrant assets for shares. On the date a warrant is exercised into
equity securities, it is marked to market as a derivative asset with the
resulting change in value recognized as a gain or loss on derivatives in
noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.

As of the exercise date, the basis or value in the
equity securities is reclassified from Other assets to Investment securities on
the balance sheet. The equity securities are classified as available-for-sale
securities under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Instrument” (SFAS No. 115). In accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No. 115, changes in fair value of securities designated as
available for sale, after applicable taxes, are excluded from net income and
reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate
component of stockholders’ equity.

The derivative
equity warrant portfolio is comprised of warrants in companies from industries
served by SVB Financial Group, as described in Item 1. Business. The fair value
of the derivative equity warrant portfolio is reviewed quarterly. We value the
equity warrant assets using an option pricing model approach, based on the
standard Black-Scholes pricing model utilizing the following five material
assumptions:

·

Underlying
stock value was estimated based on information available, including any
information regarding subsequent rounds of funding and a review of related
customer credit files.

·

Volatility,
or the quantification of the risk associated with the warrants over time, was
based on guideline publicly traded companies or indices similar in nature to
the underlying client companies issuing the warrant. A total of ten such
indices were used. The volatility assumption for each warrant was calculated
based on the average of the annualized daily volatility of a basket of
comparable public companies over each of the fiscal quarters from January 1,
2002 to December 31, 2005. The weighted average quarterly median
volatility assumption used for the warrant valuation at December 31, 2005
was 47.4%.

·

Actual
data on cancellations, expirations and exercises of our warrants was utilized
as the basis for determining the expected remaining life of the warrants in
each financial reporting period. Warrants may be exercised in the event of acquisitions,
mergers or initial public offerings (IPO), and cancelled due to events such as
bankruptcies, restructuring activities or additional financings.

·

The
risk-free interest rates were derived from the appropriate Treasury yield
curve. Risk-free interest rates reflect the rates of return available on
long-term high-quality fixed-income debt instruments.  Subsequent to issuance, the risk-free rate was
calculated based on a weighted average of the risk-free rates that correspond
closest to the expected remaining life of the warrant.

·

Other
adjustments were estimated based on management’s judgment about the general
industry environment combined with specific information about the issuing
company, when available.


The fair value of
our derivative equity warrant assets recorded on our balance sheets represents
our best estimate of the fair value of these instruments within the framework
of existing accounting standards and guidance provided by the Securities and
Exchange Commission on fair value accounting. Changes in the above material
assumptions will result in significantly different valuations. For example, the
following table demonstrates the effect of changes in the expected life and
volatility assumptions:

Valuation of Equity Warrant Assets Held(1) by Silicon
Valley Bank Active at December 31, 2005

(1)

In addition to Silicon
Valley Bank’s warrant assets at December 31, 2005, warrants assets at
Partners for Growth were valued at $2.1 million, using 39.5% volatility and 3.9
years expected life.

The timing and value realized from the disposition of
warrant related equity securities to third parties, depend upon factors beyond
our control, including the performance of the underlying portfolio companies,
investor demand for initial public offerings, fluctuations in the market prices
of the underlying common stock of these companies, levels of mergers and
acquisitions activity, and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to
sell the underlying securities. In addition, our equity warrant assets could
lose value or become worthless, which would impact our consolidated net income.
All of these factors are difficult to predict. Due to the composition of our
portfolio of equity warrant assets, it is likely that many of them will become
impaired. However, we are not in a position to know at the present time which
specific equity warrant assets, are likely to be impaired or the extent or
timing of individual impairments. Therefore, we cannot predict future gains or
losses with any degree of accuracy, and any gains or losses could vary
materially from period to period.

We consider accounting
policies related to derivative equity warrant assets to be critical because the
valuation of these assets is complex and is subject to a certain degree of
management judgment. Management has the ability to select from several
valuation methodologies and has latitude in the calculation of material
assumptions in the current methodology. The selection of an alternative
valuation methodology or alternative approaches used to calculate material
assumptions in the current methodology may cause our estimated values of these
assets to differ significantly from the values recorded. Additionally, the
inherent uncertainty in the process of valuing these assets for which a ready
market is unavailable may cause our estimated values of these assets to differ
significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market
for the assets existed, and those differences could be material.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

We consider our accounting policy relating to the
estimation of the allowance for loan and lease losses to be critical as
estimation of the allowance involves material estimates by our management and
is particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term. Our loan
and lease loss reserve methodology is applied to our funded and unfunded loan
commitments. The reserve associated with the funded debt is recorded as a
contra asset while the reserve associated with the unfunded loan commitments is
recorded as other liabilities. Except as described herein, the methodology for
the determination of an appropriate reserve for funded and unfunded loan
commitments is the same. The allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve
for unfunded credit commitments is management’s estimate of credit losses
inherent in the loan portfolio at a balance sheet date.


We define credit risk as the probability of sustaining
a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in
accordance with the terms of the contract. Through the administration of loan
policies and monitoring of the loan portfolio, our management seeks to reduce
such credit risk. While we follow underwriting and credit monitoring
procedures, which we believe are appropriate in growing and managing the loan
portfolio, in the event of nonperformance by these other parties, our potential
exposure to credit losses could significantly affect our consolidated results
of operations and financial condition. The allowance for loan and lease losses
is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense to
provide for credit risk. Our allowance for loan and lease losses is established
for loan losses that are probable but not yet realized. The process of
anticipating loan losses is imprecise. Our management applies an evaluation
process, as described below, to our loan portfolio to estimate the required
allowance for loan and lease losses:

We maintain a systematic process for the evaluation of
individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses. On a
quarterly basis, each loan in our portfolio is assigned a credit risk rating.
Credit risk-ratings are assigned on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing
loans with a low risk of nonpayment, 9 representing loans with the highest risk
of nonpayment, and 10 representing loans which have been charged-off. This
credit risk-rating evaluation process includes, but is not limited to,
consideration of such factors as payment status, the financial condition of the
borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral
values, potential loan concentrations, and general economic conditions. Our
policies require a committee of senior management to review, at least
quarterly, credit relationships that exceed specific dollar values. Our review
process evaluates the appropriateness of the credit risk rating and allocation
of the allowance for loan and lease losses, as well as other account management
functions. Our Internal Audit department reviews a selection of credit
relationships. In addition, our management receives and approves an analysis
for all impaired loans, as defined by SFAS No. 114, “Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan” (SFAS No. 114). The allowance for loan
and lease losses is allocated based on a formula allocation for similarly
risk-rated loans by client industry
sector

and for individually
impaired loans as determined by SFAS No. 114

Our evaluation process was designed to determine the
adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. We assess the risk of
losses inherent in the loan portfolio by utilizing modeling techniques. For
this purpose, we have developed a statistical model based on historical loan
loss migration to estimate an appropriate allowance for outstanding loan
balances. In addition, we apply a macro allocation to the results of the
aforementioned model to ascertain the total allowance for loan and lease
losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective
information, the classification of loans and the establishment of the allowance
for loan and lease losses relies, to a great extent, on the judgment and
experience of our management.

Historical
Loan Loss Migration Model

We use the historical loan loss migration model as a
basis for determining expected loan loss factors by credit risk-rating category
and by client industry sector. The effectiveness of the historical loan loss
migration model is predicated on the theory that historical trends are
predictive of future experience. Specifically,
the model calculates the likelihood of a loan

becoming charged-off
based on its credit risk rating using
historical loan performance data from our portfolio.

We analyze the historical
loan loss migration trend by compiling gross loan loss data and by credit risk
rating for the rolling twelve-month periods as of the end of each quarter. Each
of the loans charged-off over the twelve-month period is assigned a credit risk
rating at the period end of each of the preceding four quarters. On an annual
basis, the model calculates charged-off loans as a percentage of current period
end loans by credit risk-rating category and by client industry sector. The
percentages are averaged and aggregated to estimate our loan loss factors. The
annual periods are reviewed and averaged to form the loan loss factors for
several quarters of history. The current period-end client loan balances are
aggregated


by
risk-rating category and by client industry sector. Loan loss factors for each
risk-rating category and client industry sector are ultimately applied to the
respective period-end client loan balances for each corresponding risk-rating category
by client industry sector to provide an estimation of the allowance for loan
and lease losses.

Macro
Allocations

A macro allocation
is calculated each quarter based upon management’s assessment of the risks that
may lead to a future loan loss experience different from our historical loan
loss experience. These risks are aggregated to become our macro allocation.
Based on management’s prediction or estimate of changing risks in the lending
environment, the macro allocation may vary significantly from period to period
and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of the following factors:

·

Changes
in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and
collections, and charge-off and recovery practices.

·

Changes
in national and local economic business conditions, including the market and
economic condition of our clients’ industry sectors.

·

Changes
in the nature of our loan portfolio.

·

Changes
in experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff.

·

Changes
in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans.

·

Changes
in the trend of the volume of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings,
and other loan modifications.

·

Other
factors as determined by management from time to time

Finally, we compute
several modified versions of the model, which provide additional assurance that
the statistical results of the historical loan loss migration model are
reasonable. A committee comprised of senior management evaluate the adequacy of
the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the results of our analysis.

Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments

We consider our accounting
policy relating to the estimation of the allowance for unfunded credit
commitments to be critical as estimation of the allowance involves material
estimates by our management and is particularly susceptible to significant
changes in the near term. We record a liability for probable and estimable
losses associated with our unfunded loan commitments. Each quarter, every
unfunded client credit commitment is allocated to a credit risk-rating category
in accordance with each client’s credit risk rating. We use the historical loan
loss factors described above to calculate the possible loan loss experience if
unfunded credit commitments are funded. Separately, we use historical trends to
calculate the probability of an unfunded credit commitment being funded by us.
We apply the loan funding probability factor to risk-factor adjusted unfunded
commitments by credit risk-rating to derive the reserve for unfunded loan
commitments. The allowance for unfunded credit commitments may also include
certain macro allocations as deemed appropriate by our management. We reflect
our allowance for unfunded credit commitments in other liabilities.

Goodwill

Goodwill, which arises from the purchase price
exceeding the assigned value of the net assets of an acquired business,
represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being
acquired. Our goodwill at December 31, 2005 related to the acquisition of
SVB Alliant (Alliant Partners), a firm


which specializes in
advisory services related to mergers and acquisitions. The value of this
goodwill is supported by the free cash flows from SVB Alliant. A decline in
earnings as a result of a decline in mergers and acquisitions transaction
volume or a decline in the valuations of mergers and acquisitions clients could
lead to an impairment of the goodwill carrying amount, which would be recorded
as a write-down in our consolidated net income.

On an annual basis or as circumstances dictate, our
management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may
indicate impairment in the carrying amount. We consider our accounting policy
on goodwill to be critical because the evaluation methodology for potential
impairments is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment
in the use of estimates and assumptions. We evaluate impairment using a
two-step process. First, we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting
unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the
carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the reporting
unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare the “implied” fair value, defined
below, of the reporting unit’s goodwill with its carrying amount. If the
carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then goodwill
impairment is recognized by writing goodwill down to the implied fair value.

We primarily use a discounted cash flow approach to
value the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment. These
estimates involve many assumptions, including expected results of operations
and assumed discount rates. The discount rate used is based on standard
industry practice, taking into account the expected equity risk premium, the
size of the business, and the probability of the reporting unit achieving its
financial forecasts. The implied fair value is determined by allocating the
fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that
unit, as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair
value of the unit was the purchase price.

Events that may indicate
goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in results of
operations of the business, economic or political climate, an adverse action or
assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, and a
more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or disposed
of. More information about goodwill is included in Item 8. Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note

Results of Operations

Earnings Summary

We reported consolidated
net income of $92.5 million in 2005, as compared to consolidated net income of
$63.9 million in 2004 and $13.0 million in 2003. Diluted earnings per common
share totaled $2.40 for 2005, as compared to $1.70 for 2004 and $0.35 for 2003.

Dilutive Effect of
Contingently Convertible Debt on our Diluted Earnings per Share Calculation

We included the dilutive effect of the $150.0 million
zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes due June 15, 2008 in our fully
diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculation using the treasury stock method,
in accordance with the provisions of EITF 90-19, “Convertible Bonds
With Issuer Option to Settle in Cash Upon Conversion” (EITF 90-19)
and SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share” (SFAS No. 128). The exposure
draft of SFAS No. 128R, if adopted in its proposed form, will require us
to change our accounting for the calculation of EPS on our contingently
convertible debt to the “if converted” method. The “if converted” treatment of
the contingently convertible debt would have decreased EPS by $0.18 per diluted
common share, or 7.5 percent for 2005.

In September 2004,
the EITF reached final consensus on EITF 04-8, “The Effect of
Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share” (EITF 04-8),
that contingently convertible


securities should be treated as convertible securities
and included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share. The
potential dilutive effect of the contingently convertible debt using the
treasury stock method was considered anti-dilutive in 2003, whereby the average
price of our stock during the periods were less than the conversion price. The
potential dilutive effect of the contingently convertible debt using the
treasury stock method was approximately 1.3 million shares and 0.4 million shares
as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.

2005 Compared to
2004—Increase in consolidated net income, increase in net income/noninterest
income.

Consolidated net
income increased by $28.7 million between 2005 and 2004.

·

Net
interest income increased by $69.8 million primarily due to an increase in
average interest-earning assets, and also due to an increase in yield earned on
those assets, particularly loans.

·

Noninterest
income increased by $9.7 million. The increase was primarily due to increases
in client investment fees and gains on foreign exchange derivatives, partially
offset by a decrease in deposit service charges.

·

An
increase in noninterest expense of $18.0 million was largely attributable to
higher compensation and benefits expense of $9.7 million in 2005. In addition,
we incurred higher professional services fees associated with the restatement
of our financial statements and commitment of resources to adhere to the
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

·

Finally, our effective tax
rate increased by 1.8% to 39.6% in 2005.

2004 Compared to

Increase in Consolidated
Net Income

—Increase in Net Interest Income, Decrease
in Impairment of Goodwill Expense

Consolidated net
income increased by $50.8 million between 2004 and 2003:

·

Impairment
of goodwill expense decreased by $61.1 million. In 2003, we recorded an
impairment charge related to goodwill associated with the SVB Alliant
acquisition of $63.0 million;

·

Net
interest income increased by $46.3 million, primarily due to increased interest
income from both investment securities and loans; and

·

Noninterest
income increased by $26.4 million, primarily due to an increase of $14.8
million in returns on investments securities. In addition, corporate finance
fees increased $9.8 million, an increase in letter of credit and standby letter
of credit income of $1.1 million and an increase in client investment fees of
$2.9 million, offset by reduced gains on derivative instruments of $3.9
million.

These improvements to consolidated net income were
partially offset by increases in certain noninterest expense categories,
particularly compensation and benefits expense, which was higher in 2004
primarily due to variable compensation, attributable to our improved financial
performance. Additionally, we experienced an increase in professional services
expense primarily due to expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.
Finally, our effective tax rate increased to 37.8% in 2004 from 24.2% in 2003.


The
major components of net income and changes in these components are summarized
in the following table for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, and are discussed in more detail on the following pages.

Net Interest Income
and Margin

Net interest income is defined as the difference
between interest earned (primarily on loans, investment securities and federal
funds sold, securities purchased under agreement to resell and other short-term
investments) and interest paid on funding sources (such as deposits and
borrowings). Net interest income is our principal source of revenue. Net
interest margin is defined as the amount of net interest income, on a fully
taxable-equivalent basis, expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning
assets. The average yield earned on interest-earning assets is the amount of
taxable-equivalent interest income expressed as a percentage of average
interest-earning assets. The average rate paid on funding sources is defined as
interest expense as a percentage of average funding sources.


The following table sets forth average assets, liabilities, minority
interest and stockholders’ equity, interest income and interest expense,
average yields and rates, and the composition of our net interest margin for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003.

(1)

Includes average interest-yielding
deposits in other financial institutions of $20.4 million, $10.6 million, and
$0.8 million, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(2)

Average noninterest-earning investment
securities, primarily marketable and non-marketable equity securities, are
excluded from the totals of investment securities and are included in other
assets. Average noninterest-earning investment securities amounted to $157.1
million, $107.6 million and $85.9 million for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The calculation of yield on
available-for-sale securities is based on average historical cost and does not
give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected in stockholders’
equity.

(3)

Interest income on nontaxable investments
is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using the federal statutory
tax rate of 35% for all years presented. These adjustments were $2.0 million,
$2.7 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

(4)

Average loans include average nonaccrual
loans of $13.0 million, $14.5 million 
and $16.1 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(5)

Average loans are net of average unearned income of
$19.5 million, $16.4 million and $14.2 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.


(6)

Loan interest income includes loan fees of
$39.1 million, $31.9 million and $31.2 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

(7)

Adoption of FIN 46R in December 2003 and SFAS No. 150
in May 2003 resulted in a change of classification of trust preferred
securities distribution expense from noninterest expense to interest expense on
a prospective basis. Additionally, the adoption of FIN 46R and SFAS No. 150
resulted in a change of classification of trust preferred securities from
noninterest-bearing funding sources to interest-bearing liabilities on a
prospective basis. Prior to adoption of FIN 46R and SFAS No. 150, in
accordance with accounting rules in effect at that time, we recorded trust
preferred securities distribution expense as noninterest expense. On October 30,
2003, $50.0 million in cumulative 7.0% trust preferred securities were issued
through a newly formed special purpose trust, SVB Capital II. We received $51.5
million in proceeds from the issuance of 7.0% junior subordinated debentures to
SVB Capital II. A portion of the net proceeds were used to redeem the existing
$40.0 million of 8.25% trust preferred securities. Approximately $1.3 million
of unamortized issuance costs related to redemption of the $40.0 million 8.25%
trust preferred securities were included in interest expense in the fourth
quarter of 2003.

Net
interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “volume change.” Net
interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on
interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities,
referred to as “rate change”. The following table sets forth changes in
interest income for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest
expense for each major category of interest-bearing liabilities. The table also
reflects the amount of simultaneous changes attributable to both volume and
rate changes for the years indicated. For this table, changes that are not
solely due to either volume or rate are allocated in proportion to the
percentage changes in average volume and average rate. Changes relating to
investments in non-taxable municipal securities are presented on a fully
taxable-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 35% for all
years presented.

2005 Compared to

Net Interest Income

Net interest income, on a
fully taxable-equivalent basis, totaled $301.3 million for 2005, an increase of
$69.1 million, or 29.8% from 2004. The increase in net interest income was the
result of a $74.9 million increase in interest income and offset by a $5.8
million increase in interest expense.


Interest Income—Net
Increase in Interest-Earning Assets (Volume Variance)

The $74.9 million increase in interest income, on a
fully taxable-equivalent basis, was partially due to the result of a $40.3
million favorable volume variance. The favorable volume variance resulted from
a $352.8 million, or 8.2% increase, in average interest-earning assets.
Increases in our sources of funding, largely non-interest bearing funding
sources, were the main contributors to the increase in average interest-earning
assets. Average deposits increased $261.1 million due to a continued improved
venture capital funding environment and a general improvement in business
conditions for many of our clients. In addition, a decrease in federal funds
sold, securities purchased under agreement to resell and other short-term
investments of $294.2 million was used to fund investments in loans and taxable
securities. Loans and taxable investment securities collectively increased
$686.1 million.

Average investment securities increased by $230.3
million, resulting in a $9.2 million favorable volume variance. We estimated
the duration of the total investment portfolio at December 31, 2005 to be
2.9 years, compared to 2.1 years at December 31, 2004.

In addition, average loans
increased by $416.7 million resulting in a $36.6 million favorable volume
variance. The volume variance is largely driven by growth in our commercial
loan category, which represented $355.5 million of the increase, followed by
smaller increases in the real estate and consumer loan categories. In
particular, the average balances of higher-yielding loan products such as
asset-based loans and accounts receivable factoring increased by $51.0 million
and $73.0 million, respectively. The increase in average loans reflects an improvement
in economic activity and in the markets served by us. Our loan yield in 2005
included $6.1 million from accretion of gross warrant loan fees as compared to
$5.7 million in 2004.

Interest Income—Change
in Market Interest Rates and Shift in Investment Portfolio Mix (Rate Variance)

Favorable rate
variances associated with each component of interest earning assets caused a
$34.6 million increase in interest income. The yield on average
interest-earning assets increased 118 basis points overall, largely driven by
higher yields generated by average loans and taxable investment securities. The
increase in yields on interest-earning assets was primarily caused by:

·

an
increase in our prime lending rate,

·

an
increase in short-term market interest rates,

·

a
shift in the loan portfolio mix, and

·

a
shift in the average investment portfolio mix.

The average yield on federal funds sold, securities
purchased under agreement to resell and other short-term investments for 2005
increased by 165 basis points to 3.04% from 1.39% resulting in a favorable rate
variance of $6.6 million. The aforementioned increases in short-term market
interest rates were largely responsible for this favorable rate variance.

The average yield on taxable investment securities for
2005 increased 14 basis points to 4.42% from 4.28% in the comparable prior year
period, causing a $2.9 million favorable rate variance associated with our
average investment securities. This was primarily due to a shift in the
composition of a portion of the investment portfolio to a slightly higher
concentration of higher-yielding, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized
mortgage obligations.

We realized a $25.1
million favorable rate variance associated with our loan portfolio, largely
driven by a shift in loan product mix and increases in short-term market
interest rates. On eight occasions during 2005 we increased our prime lending
rate, each time by 25 basis points, bringing our prime rate to 7.25%, in
response to increases in short-term market interest rates. Our weighted-average
prime lending rate


increased
to 6.18% in 2005 from 4.34% in 2004. As of December 31, 2005,
approximately 73.8%, or $2.1 billion of our total loan portfolio, were variable
rate loans and would reprice with an increase in our prime lending rate. The
increase in loan yields was also partially attributable to a shift in the
composition of the loan portfolio to higher-yielding, asset-based lending and
accounts receivable factoring products.

Interest Expense

Total interest expense for 2005 increased by $5.8
million due to unfavorable rate variance of $3.9 million from an increase in
interest expense related to money market deposits and an unfavorable volume
variance of $1.9 million largely attributable to federal funds purchased and securities
sold under agreement to repurchase.

The unfavorable rate variance was also attributable to
an increase in the average rates paid on our money market deposits, from 0.50%
in 2004 to 0.70% in 2005 and on our bonus money market deposits, from 0.50% in 2004
to 0.76% in 2005. The increase in interest rates on these products was in
response to increases in short-term market interest rates which became
effective in the same period.

During 2005 the average balance of federal funds
purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase was $69.5 million
and the average interest rate during the period was 3.88%.

In 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap
agreement with a notional amount of $50.0 million. This interest rate swap
agreement hedges against the risk of changes in fair value associated with our
7.0% junior subordinated debentures. The terms of this fair value hedge
agreement provide for a swap of our 7.0% fixed rate payment for a variable rate
based on LIBOR plus a spread. For 2005, we paid interest expense of $3.5
million on the 7.0% junior subordinated debentures. However, the fair value
hedge agreement provided a benefit of $1.2 million, resulting in net interest
expense of $2.3 million for 2005, compared to $1.3 million for 2004.

The average cost of funds
paid increased 11 basis points in 2005 to 0.37%, changed from 0.26% for 2004.
The increase in deposit rates resulted from our decision to increase rates for
interest-bearing deposit accounts in response to recent increases in short-term
market interest rates.

2004 Compared to

Net Interest Income

Net interest income, on a
fully taxable-equivalent basis, totaled $232.2 million for 2004, an increase of
$45.7 million, or 24.5%, from 2003. The increase in net interest income was the
result of a $43.6 million increase in interest income and a $2.1 million
decrease in interest expense.

Interest Income—Net
Increase in Interest-Earning Assets (Volume Variance)

The $43.6 million increase in interest income for
2004, as compared to 2003, was primarily the result of a $37.6 million
favorable volume variance. The favorable volume variance resulted from a $700.1
million, or 19.4% increase, in average interest-earning assets. We believe
increases in our sources of funding, largely deposits, were the main
contributors to the increase in average interest-earning assets. We believe
deposits increased due to an improved venture capital funding environment and
general improvements in business conditions for many of our clients. This
increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily centered in
investment securities, which increased $628.9 million, and loans, which
increased $153.7 million.

Average investment securities increased by $628.9
million, resulting in a $26.3 million favorable volume variance. Throughout
2004, we continued our investment strategy of changing the investment portfolio
mix by increasing the portion of the portfolio invested in relatively
higher-yielding mortgage-


backed securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations. Our average investments in mortgage-backed
securities and collateralized mortgage obligations collectively increased by
$564.8 million for 2004 as compared to 2003, largely funded by increases in
client deposits. We estimated the duration of our investment portfolio
increased to 2.1 years at December 31, 2004, from 1.7 years at December 31,
2003. The increase in duration was primarily due to the increase in
mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations whose
average duration is typically in the 2 to 5 year range.

In addition, average loans increased by $153.7
million, or 8.5% in 2004 as compared to 2003, resulting in a $12.4 million
favorable volume variance. The volume variance is largely driven by growth in
our commercial loan category, which increased by $106.8 million. In particular,
the average balances of higher-yielding loan products such as asset-based loans
and accounts receivable factoring increased by $39.4 million and $68.6 million,
respectively. In addition, we also grew our average real estate and consumer
loan portfolios. The increase in average loans reflects an improvement in
economic activity and in the markets served by us. These new loans continue to
be subject to our existing underwriting practices. Our strategy is to grow average
loans modestly during 2005 as our corporate technology efforts continue to
develop. Our loan yield in 2004 included $5.7 million from accretion of gross
warrant loan fees as compared to $6.6 million in 2003.

Average federal funds
sold, securities purchased under agreement to resell and other short-term
investments for 2004 decreased by $82.4 million, or 11.9%, resulting in a $1.0
million unfavorable volume variance.

Interest Income—Shift
in the Composition of Average Interest-Earning Assets (Rate Variance)

Favorable rate variances associated with each
component of interest-earning assets caused a $6.0 million increase in interest
income in 2004 as compared to 2003. Although the yields on federal funds sold,
securities purchased under agreement to resell and other short-term investment
securities increased and the yield on loans remained unchanged, the yield on
total average interest-earning assets remained relatively unchanged. The
overall yield remained unchanged due to a change in the mix of our total average
interest-earning assets. In 2004, investment securities represented 40.7% of
our total average interest-earning assets and loans represented 45.3% of our
total average interest-earning assets. In 2003, investment securities
represented 31.1% of our total average interest-earning assets, and loans
represented 49.8% of our total average interest-earning assets. Thus, the
increase in yields on federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreement
to resell and other short-term investment securities in 2004 as compared to
2003 was offset by the change in overall composition of our interest-earning
assets.

We increased our prime lending rate by 25 basis points
on each of five occasions in the latter half of 2004, increasing it from 4.00%
to 5.25%. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 81.3%, or $1.9 billion,
of our outstanding loans were variable rate loans, which would re-price with
any further increase or any decrease in our prime lending rate, unless
restricted by the terms of any such loans.

The yield on investment securities increased by 12
basis points to 4.42% in 2004 from 4.30% for 2003, causing a $2.9 million
favorable rate variance. This was primarily due to a shift in the composition
of a portion of the investment portfolio to relatively higher-yielding
mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.

We also realized a $1.4
million favorable rate variance associated with our federal funds sold,
securities purchased under agreement to resell and other short-term
investments, which is largely driven by higher short-term market interest rates
in 2004 as compared to 2003. We expect to continue the trend of managing
federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreement to resell and other
short-term investments at appropriate levels for our liquidity needs.


Interest Expense

Total interest expense for 2004 decreased by $2.1
million from 2003, despite a $167.4 million, or 10.1% increase in our
interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in interest expense was primarily
the result of a $4.0 million favorable rate variance, partially offset by a
$1.9 million unfavorable volume variance.

We experienced a favorable rate variance of $4.0
million primarily due to lower interest expense related to borrowing. In the
fourth quarter of 2003, we recognized $1.3 million in unamortized issuance
costs associated with the early redemption of the $40.0 million, 8.25% trust
preferred securities.

Also, in the fourth quarter of 2003, we issued $51.5
million in 7.0% junior subordinated debentures and simultaneously entered into
an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $50.0 million. This
interest rate swap agreement hedges against the risk of changes in fair value
associated with our 7.0% junior subordinated debentures. The terms of this fair
value hedge agreement provide for a swap of our 7.0% fixed rate payment for a
variable rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. For 2004, we paid interest expense
of $3.5 million on the 7.0% junior subordinated debentures. However, the fair
value hedge agreement provided income of $2.2 million, resulting in net
interest expense of $1.3 million for 2004.

There were significant fluctuations in several line
items of the total interest expense volume variance, which largely offset each
other. In particular, the implementation SFAS No. 150 and FIN 46 in mid-2003
required us to reclassify our trust preferred securities to the long-term debt
category during 2003. Additionally, these accounting pronouncements also
required us to classify the trust preferred securities distribution expense as
interest expense, on a prospective basis. The trust preferred distribution
expense had previously been classified as noninterest expense.

Increases in regular money market and bonus money
market deposits contributed a $1.3 million unfavorable variance to the total
interest expense volume variance. This unfavorable volume variance was largely
offset by lower time deposits, which provided a $1.0 million favorable volume
variance. Due to the general improvement in the venture capital funding
environment, highly-liquid money market deposits increased by $247.1 million,
while longer-term time deposits have decreased by $155.9 million. Our clients
may use time deposits as collateral for letters of credit issued by Silicon
Valley Bank on their behalf, to certain third parties such as real estate
lessors. We believe time deposits have decreased partly because of a softer
real estate market, which generally reduces the frequency of these types of
arrangements. Moreover, due to the general improvement in the economic
environment, borrowings secured by time deposits have decreased.

A shift of client funds from time deposits to more
liquid money market deposits also contributed to the favorable rate variance.

The average cost of funds
of 0.26% for 2004 represented a decrease from 0.37% in 2003. The decrease was
largely attributable to a decrease in the cost of borrowings and to a relative
increase in noninterest-bearing funding sources as a percentage of total
funding sources.

Provision for Loan
Losses

The provision for loan
losses is based on our evaluation of the adequacy of the existing allowance for
loan and lease losses in relation to total loans and on our periodic assessment
of the inherent and identified risk dynamics of the loan portfolio resulting
from reviews of selected individual loans and loan commitments. For a more
detailed discussion of credit quality and the allowance for loan and lease
losses, see Item 7. Critical Accounting Policies and Item 7. Financial
Condition—Credit Quality and the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.


2005 Compared to

We recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of
$0.2 million for 2005, compared to a recovery of $10.3 million for 2004.

We incurred net
charge offs of approximately $1.1 million for 2005 compared to net charge-offs
of $2.0 million for 2004, respectively. Credit quality remained strong with
nonperforming loans at 0.26% of total gross loans. See “Financial Condition -
Credit Quality and the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” for additional
related discussion.

2004 Compared to 2003—Continued Improved Credit
Quality Prompts Further Recovery of Provision for Loan Losses

We realized a recovery of
provision for loan losses of $10.3 million in 2004 compared to a recovery of
provision for loan losses of $9.9 million in 2003. In 2003, our loan loss
recoveries exceeded loan charge offs by $1.4 million. We incurred net
charge-offs of approximately $2.0 million in 2004 and credit quality remained
strong with nonperforming loans at 0.64% of gross loans. We believe the
improvement in the recovery of loan losses was primarily attributable to our
improved credit risk management and to improved economic conditions.

Noninterest Income

The
following table summarizes the components of noninterest income and the percent
change from year to year:

(1)

Client
funds invested through SVB Financial Group, maintained at third party financial
institutions.


Compared to 2004

We offer investment products and services that include
mutual funds and other investments, sweep products, and asset management
services to our clients. Our fees, calculated on clients’ average balances,
ranged from 6 to 75 basis points (fixed income securities and Federated Sweep,
respectively) as of December 31, 2005, compared to a range of 9 to 70
basis points as of December 31, 2004. Total client investment funds were
$15.0 billion at December 31, 2005, compared to $11.2 billion at December 31,
2004. Client investment assets under management at December 31, 2005,
accounted for 25.8%, of total client investment funds compared to 23.8% at December 31,
2004. Mutual fund products were $7.8 billion at December 31, 2005 and $6.2
billion at December 31, 2004. Client investment fee income for 2005 of
$33.3 million was $6.3 million higher than $26.9 million for 2004. The
increased income in 2005 as compared to 2004 was largely attributable to the
overall growth in client investment fund balances.

Gains on derivatives increased by $8.3 million. The
gains were primarily due to client related foreign exchange forward contracts
which increased by $5.2 million or 37.1%. We believe that a general improvement
in business conditions for many of our clients and increased international
trading was the primary driver behind a higher volume of client foreign
exchange transactions. Gains (losses) on foreign exchange forward contracts
related to our foreign currency denominated loans improved by $2.5 million from
a loss of $0.4 million in 2004 to a gain of $2.1 million in 2005. The change in
gains (losses) from these foreign exchange forward contracts was related to
changes in the value of the underlying contracts caused by fluctuations in the
foreign exchange market. (See table below).

The
following table summarizes the components of gains on derivative instruments,
net, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the percent
changes from period to period:

(1)

Represents the income
differential between foreign exchange forward contracts/non-deliverable foreign
exchange forward contracts with clients and opposite way foreign exchange
forward contracts/non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts with
correspondent banks. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data—Note 13. Derivative Financial Instruments.

(2)

Represents change in
fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts with correspondent banks to
economically decrease foreign exchange exposure risk related to certain foreign
currency denominated loans. The net foreign currency loss adjustment associated
with these foreign currency denominated loans is recorded in other noninterest
income.

The change in fair value of equity warrant assets is
primarily attributed to the changes in the value of the underlying assumptions
derived consistently using our methodology to value warrants including: changes
in the risk-free interest rate, changes in the underlying value of the client companies’ stock, changes in the
volatility of market comparable public companies and changes in the expected
life.


Deposit services for 2005 were $9.8 million, compared
to $13.5 million for 2004, a decrease of $3.7 million. Clients compensate us
for depository services, either through earnings credits computed on their
demand deposit balances, or via explicit payments that we recognize as deposit
service charge income. Earnings credits are calculated using client average
daily deposit balances, less a reserve requirement and a discounted U.S.
Treasury bill interest rate. Clients received higher earnings credit in 2005
compared to the prior year due to increased short-term market interest rates in
2005, resulting in additional credits to offset deposit service charges.

Credit card fees increased by $0.1 million due to fees
earned on higher credit card balances in 2005.

We
recognized net investment gains of $4.3 million in 2005, as compared to net
investment gains of $5.2 million in 2004. The following table summarizes the
components of gains and losses on investment securities for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, and the percent change from period to period:

Investment gains in 2005
were principally derived from the changes in fair value and realized sales of
marketable and non-marketable equity securities from private equity securities,
our managed funds of funds, our managed venture capital fund, and direct equity
investments. We expect continued variability in the performance of our equity
portfolios.

2004 Compared to

Total client investment funds were $11.2 billion at December 31,
2004, compared to $9.3 billion at December 31, 2003, an increase of $1.9
billion, or 20.2%. As of December 31, 2004, client investment


assets under management
accounted for $2.7 billion, or 23.8%, of total client investment funds. Mutual
fund products were $6.2 billion at December 31, 2004, and $6.4 billion at December 31,
2003.

Client investment fee income increased by $2.9 million
from 2003 to 2004. Client investment fees for 2004 were $26.9 million. The
increased income was largely attributable to the growth in client investment
funds.

The increase in corporate finance fees in 2004 over
2003 was in large part due to a single large investment banking transaction,
which generated $6.1 million in fees. SVB Alliant’s business is highly variable
so we expect to see significant changes in corporate finance fees from year to
year.

The increase in letter of credit and standby letter of
credit income was primarily due to a higher volume of transactions, which
resulted from increased global economic activity associated with our clients’
markets.

We
recognized net investment gains of $5.2 million in 2004, as compared to net
investment losses of $9.6 million in 2003. The following table summarizes the
components of gains and losses on investment securities for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the percent change from period to period:

Investment gains in 2004 were principally derived from
the changes in fair value and realized sales of marketable and non-marketable
equity securities from private equity securities, our managed funds of funds,
our managed venture capital fund, and direct equity investments. Losses on our
equity investments, excluding the impact of minority interest, were $1.3
million for 2004 compared to $4.0 million for 2003. We expect continued
variability in the performance of our equity portfolio.

Noninterest Expense

The
following table presents the detail of noninterest expense and the percent
change, year over year:

2005 Compared to
2004—Increases in Professional Services and Compensation and Benefits Expense

The increase in compensation and benefits expense of
$9.7 million was partly due to an increase in salaries and wages expense of
$4.2 million, or 5.2%, to $85.0 million for 2005, compared to $80.9 million for
2004. The increase in salaries and wages is largely attributable to an increase
in average full-time equivalent (FTE) personnel and higher rates of employee
salaries and wages. Average FTE personnel increased by 31 to 1,029 in 2005 from
998 in 2004. Equity-based compensation increased by $3.6 million, or 105.1%, to
$7.1 million for 2005, compared to $3.5 million for 2004. This increase
reflects our increased use of restricted stock and restricted stock units, in
lieu of stock options, as components of our employee compensation structure, as
we transition our equity-based compensation programs.

Professional service expense totaled $28.7 million for
2005, an increase of $11.7 million as compared to $17.1 million for 2004. The
primary components of this net increase were associated with the commitment of
resources to amend and restate our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2004, the commitment of resources to document, enhance and audit internal
controls to accomplish and adhere to the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 and the independent audit of our internal controls, and expenses
associated with certain Information Technology (“IT”) development projects. We
expect our IT development project costs to increase in 2006.

Net occupancy expense
decreased between 2005 and 2004. We renegotiated the lease related to our
corporate headquarters facility in Santa Clara, California, The term of the new
corporate headquarters lease began retroactively on August 1, 2004, and
will end on September 30, 2014, unless terminated on an earlier date.
Based on the new lease terms, our corporate headquarters lease expense is lower
than under our previous lease arrangement.

2004 Compared to 2003—Decrease in Impairment of Goodwill,
Increases in Compensation and Benefits and Professional Services Expense

The increase in compensation and benefits expense of
$32.2 million was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation
expense of $17.5 million, or 108.1 %, to $33.7 million during 2004, compared to
$16.2 million during 2003. Incentive compensation at SVB Alliant increased $6.9
million and was driven by


an 80.5% increase in
investment banking revenues from $12.2 million to $22.0 million. The remaining
increase in incentive compensation was largely attributable to improved
financial performance of Silicon Valley Bank.

The remainder of the increase in compensation and
benefits expense during 2004 was largely due to increases in salaries and wages
expense, employee stock ownership plan expense, and equity-based compensation
expense. Salaries and wages expense increased by $3.2 million, or 4.1%, to
$80.9 million during 2004, compared to $77.7 million during 2003. The increase
was primarily attributable to higher rates of employee salaries and wages.
Average full-time equivalent (FTE) personnel was 998 during 2004, a slight
increase from 994 FTE personnel during 2003.

Employee stock ownership plan expense increased by
$3.0 million, or 78.7%, to $6.8 million during 2004, compared to $3.8 million
during 2003. Discretionary ESOP contributions, based on our consolidated net
income, are made by us to all eligible individuals employed by us on the last
day of the fiscal year. The increase in expense was attributable to our
improved consolidated financial performance. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16.
Employee Benefit Plans for further discussion of the employee stock ownership
plan.

Lastly, equity-based compensation increased by $2.5
million, or 240.6%, to $3.5 million in 2004, compared to $1.0 million in 2003.
This increase reflects our increased use of restricted stock and restricted
stock units, in lieu of stock options, as components of our employee
compensation structure, as we transition our equity-based compensation
programs.

Net occupancy expense remained relatively unchanged
between 2004 and 2003. However, on September 15, 2004, we renegotiated the
lease related to our corporate headquarters facility in Santa Clara,
California, which replaced the original lease, dated as of March 8, 1995.
The new lease covers two buildings, comprising approximately 157,000 square
feet of space, which we occupied under the previous lease, as well as a third
building, comprising approximately 56,500 square feet of space, within the same
facility complex. The total square feet of the premises leased under the new
lease arrangement is approximately 213,500 square feet, which was approximately
the same square footage of our corporate headquarters under its previous
leases. The term of the new corporate headquarters lease began retroactively on
August 1, 2004, and will end on September 30, 2014, unless terminated
on an earlier date. Based on the new lease terms, our corporate headquarters
lease expense is lower under the new lease arrangement. The landlord for these
premises committed to contributing approximately $7.0 million towards the cost
of these renovations, improvements, and alterations. We incurred renovation,
improvement, and alteration costs in excess of this amount.

Professional services expenses consist of costs
associated with corporate legal services, litigation settlements, accounting
and auditing services, information technology and other consulting, and our
Board of Directors. The increase in professional services was primarily due to
three significant factors:

Firstly, in 2003, we settled the remaining aspects of
a film loan litigation and were able to recover significant legal expenses
pertaining to those proceedings. The recovery of legal costs was recorded, upon
receipt of the funds, as a reduction of legal expense in 2003.

Secondly, in 2004 we incurred an increase in
professional services fees associated with commitment of resources to document
and enhance controls required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
independent audit thereof. In particular, these costs were substantially higher
in the fourth quarter of 2004.

Lastly, we incurred approximately $1.4 million in
professional fees related to fund raising activities associated with Gold Hill
Venture Lending 03, LP which are venture debt fund entities. These venture debt
funds raised approximately $214.1 million in capital commitments. SVB Financial
Group initiated the formation of these funds and agreed to pay a portion of the
related fund raising fees.


Over the past few years, we have continued to
emphasize stringent controls over the use of external consulting services.

The increase in furniture and equipment expense was
primarily due to the consolidation of two of our offices in southern California
and the cost of furnishings for a newly opened Silicon Valley office.

The increase in business development and travel was
primarily due to costs related to our sponsorship of the inaugural SVB Tech
Investors Forum in September 2004. At this event, which was held in San
Francisco, California, 76 public and private technology companies presented to
over 500 investors. There were also incremental travel expenses associated with
the opening of our international subsidiaries in London, England, and
Bangalore, India in September 2004.

Correspondent bank fees increased from year to year.
Many of our correspondent banks provide earnings credits to offset bank fees we
incur when using their services. Earnings credits are generally calculated
using average daily deposit balances less a reserve requirement and a
short-term market interest rate. We received lower earnings credits in 2004 as
compared to 2003 due to our maintaining lower average balances with our
correspondent banks and lower average short-term market interest rates. As
such, we had fewer earnings credits to offset bank fees charges incurred by us.
Thus, we incurred higher recognizable bank fees in 2004 as compared to 2003.
Management made the decision to lower the average balances with correspondent
banks because we were able to earn more on our funds by investing them than we
would have benefited from lower correspondent bank fees by maintaining larger
balances with our correspondent banks.

The decrease in data processing expense was primarily
due to the renegotiation, in late 2003, of the terms of an agreement with one
of our more significant outsourced data processing providers from a data
processing arrangement to a short-term software licensing arrangement. The
change in the agreement was executed to facilitate the transition of this data
processing from the external provider to our internal resources. Hence the
expenses associated with this vendor, which were classified as data processing
in the first six months of 2003, were classified as expensed software under the
caption furniture and equipment through August 2004. We commenced the
in-sourcing of this data processing application in late 2004.

The decrease in impairment
of goodwill expense can be attributed to charges of $63.0 million incurred in
2003 related to our investment banking business unit, SVB Alliant. In 2004, we
recognized an impairment charge in the third quarter related to our private
client services business unit Woodside Asset Management (see further discussion
under Financial Condition—Goodwill below).

Minority Interest
in Net (Income) Losses of Consolidated Affiliates

Investment
gains or losses related to our managed funds (see Part II, Item 8,
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6. Investment Securities)
are included in our consolidated noninterest income. Minority interest in the
net gains or losses of these consolidated managed funds primarily represent net
investment gains or losses and management fees expense attributable to the
minority interest holders in these managed funds.

Income Taxes

2005 Compared to

Our effective tax rate was
39.6% in 2005 compared to 37.8% in 2004. The lower rate in 2004 was primarily
attributable to a higher impact of our tax-advantaged investments on the
overall pre-tax income.

2004 Compared to

Our effective income tax
rate was 37.8% in 2004, compared to 24.2% in 2003. The increase in our
effective tax rate between 2004 and 2003 was primarily attributable to higher
pre-tax income. The lower tax rate in 2003 was primarily attributable to a
higher impact of our federally tax-exempt municipal bond and tax credit funds
on overall pre-tax income.

Operating Segment Results

In accordance with SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”, we report segment
information based on the “management” approach. The management approach
designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and
assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Please refer to
the discussion of our segment organization in Part I, Item 1. Business
Overview.

Our primary source of
revenue is from net interest income. Accordingly, our segments are reported
using net interest income, net of funds transfer pricing. Funds transfer
pricing (FTP) is an internal measurement framework designed to assess the
financial impact of a financial institution’s sources and uses of funds. It is
the mechanism by which an earnings credit is given for deposits raised, and an
earnings charge is made for funded loans. We also evaluate performance based on
noninterest income and noninterest expense, which are presented as components
of segment operating profit or loss. We do not allocate income taxes to our
segments. Additionally, our management reporting model is predicated on average
asset balances therefore, it is not possible to provide period end asset
balances for segment reporting purposes. Our segment information at and for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, are as follows:

Commercial Banking

2005 Compared to

Net Income (Loss)
Before Taxes

Commercial Banking’s income before income taxes for
2005 of $130.6 million represented an increase of $51.7 million, or 65.4%, from
$78.9 million for 2004. This $68.2 million increase was the result of higher
net revenues, comprised of higher net interest income of $60.9 million and
higher noninterest income of $7.3 million. Noninterest expenses increased by
$19.2 million.

Net interest income of $230.9 million for 2005
increased $60.9 million, or 35.9%, from $170.0 million for 2004. The increase
was primarily attributable to an overall favorable rate increase of $31.8
million and an overall favorable volume increase of $29.1 million. Net interest
income is the difference between interest earned on loans, net of funds transfer
pricing and interest paid on deposits, net of funds transfer pricing.

Net loan loss recoveries of $0.3 million for 2005
represented a net change of approximately $2.7 million from $2.4 million for
2004 in net loan charge-offs.


Noninterest income of $82.4 million for 2005 increased
$7.3 million, or 9.7%, from $75.1 million for 2004. The increase was primarily
driven by client investment fees of $5.9 million, letter of credit and foreign
exchange derivative income of $3.4 million, and an increase of $1.7 million
related to the exercise of equity warrant assets.  This was partially offset by a decrease in
deposit services fees of $3.8 million.

Noninterest expense of $183.1 million for 2005
increased $19.2 million, or 11.7%, from $163.9 million for 2004. The increase
in noninterest expense was primarily related to an $11.0 million increase in
allocated expense, a $5.0 million increase in correspondent bank fees, and a
$4.5 million increase in compensation and benefits. Allocated expenses have
increased, in general, related to increases in variable compensation costs and
consulting expenses related to the restatement. In 2005, we started recording
correspondent bank fees by client, which allowed us to report the fee expense
in the appropriate business segment. Prior to 2005, correspondent bank fees
were not recorded by client, and such historical data is not available,
therefore the fees for 2004 were reported in Other Business Services and not
allocated to the business segments.

Financial Condition

Commercial Banking had an increase in average deposits
of $125.0 million, or 3.9%, and an increase in average loans of $401.7 million,
or 24.6%, during 2005 compared to 2004. The loan products with the largest
growth were core commercial products, which grew by $233 million, asset-based
lending, which grew by $81 million, and accounts receivable factoring, which
grew by $53 million. The increase in average deposits and average loans reflect
an improved funding environment for our venture capital-backed commercial
clients and other market factors. Additionally, we are engaged in various
marketing initiatives to attract and retain commercial clients at all stages of
growth.

2004 Compared to

Net Income (Loss)
Before Taxes

Commercial Banking’s income before income taxes for
2004 of $78.9 million represented an increase of $2.3 million, or 3.0%, from
$76.6 million for 2003. This increase was the result of higher revenues of
$28.2 million, comprised of higher net interest income of $18.1 million and
higher noninterest income of $10.1 million. Noninterest expenses increased by
$23.2 million year over year.

Net interest income of $170.0 million for 2004
increased $18.1 million, or 11.9%, from $151.8 million for 2003.  The increase was primarily related to an
increase in volume of $20.1 million, partially offset by an unfavorable rate
decrease of $2.0 million.  Net interest
income is the difference between interest earned on loans, net of funds
transfer pricing and interest paid on deposits, net of funds transfer pricing.

Recovery of provision for loan losses of $2.4 million
for 2004 represented a net change of approximately $2.7 million from a recovery
of $0.4 million for 2003.

Noninterest income of $75.1 million for 2004 increased
$10.1 million, or 15.5%, from $65.1 million for 2003. The increase was
primarily driven by letter of credit and foreign exchange derivative income,
which increased $4.6 million; collateral monitoring fees of $2.3 million, which
in 2003 were reported in Other Business Services and not in the Commercial
Bank; and sweep fees, which increased $2.2 million. In 2004, we started
recording collateral monitoring fees by client, which allowed us to report the
fee expense in the appropriate business segment. Prior to 2004, collateral
monitoring fees were not recorded by client, and such historical data is not
available, therefore the fees for 2003 were reported in Other Business Services
and not allocated to the business segments.

We believe a higher volume of client initiated foreign
exchange transactions resulted from increased global economic activity
associated with our clients’ markets.

Noninterest expense of $163.9 million for 2004
increased $23.2 million, or 16.5%, from $140.7 million in 2003. The increase in
noninterest expense was primarily driven by expense related to compensation and
benefits and business development. Specifically, incentive compensation
increased $4.1 million, aggregate employee base compensation increased $1.8
million, and other employee-related expenses increased $1.6 million. Business
development and travel expense increased by $1.0 million related to strategic
initiatives


such as the sponsorship of
the SVB Tech Forum in San Francisco in the third quarter of 2004 and the global
expansion initiatives. Noninterest expenses related to units supporting
Commercial Banking activities were also allocated to Commercial Banking.
Increases in incentive compensation expenses related to the support units also
contributed to the expense increase.

Financial Condition

Commercial Banking had an increase in average deposits
of $623.9 million, or 23.9%, and an increase in average loans of $124.9
million, or 8.3%, during 2004 compared to 2003. The loan products with the
largest growth were accounts receivable factoring, which increased by $68.1
million, and asset-based lending, which grew by $41.4 million. The increase in
average deposits and average loans reflect an improved funding environment for
our venture capital-backed commercial clients and other market factors.
Additionally, we are engaged in various marketing initiatives to attract and
retain commercial clients at all stages of growth.

SVB Capital

2005 Compared to

Net Income (Loss)
Before Taxes

SVB Capital’s income before taxes for 2005 of $10.9
million represented an $11.7 million, increase, compared to a loss of  $0.8 million for 2004. This increase was
primarily attributable to increases in interest income and noninterest income,
partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. As a note of reference,
prior to 2005, the exercise of derivative equity warrant assets were reported
under SVB Capital. This line has been reclassified to the Commercial Bank for
all reporting periods.

Net interest income for 2005 of $21.6 million represented
a $9.8 million increase from $11.8 million for 2004. The increase was primarily
attributable to a favorable rate increase of $5.7 million and an increase in
income from a favorable volume variance of $3.4 million. Net interest income is
the difference between interest earned on loans, net of funds transfer pricing
and interest paid on deposits, net of funds transfer pricing.

Noninterest income for 2005 of $8.7 million
represented a $3.4 million, or 64.6% increase, from $5.3 million for 2004.
Investment gains or losses related to our managed funds, (see Part II,
Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8.
Investment Securities), are included in our consolidated noninterest income.
Minority interest in the net gains or losses of these consolidated managed
funds primarily represent net investment gains or losses and management fees
expense attributable to the minority interest holders in these managed funds.

The remaining increase in noninterest income year over
year is primarily attributable to an increase in net securities gains of $1.5
million and an increase in deposit service fees and letter of credit and
derivative foreign exchange forward contracts of $0.7 million and $0.6 million
respectively.

Noninterest expense for 2005 of $19.4 million
represented a $1.5 million, or 8.4% increase from $17.9 million for 2004.

Financial Condition

SVB Capital had an increase in average deposits of
$119.0 million, or 22.98%, while average loans decreased by $14.8 million, or
19.3%, during 2005 compared to 2004. The growth in average deposits was due to
various market factors, including an improved funds flow environment for SVB
Capital’s client base, venture capital, and private equity firms, as well as
our initiatives to serve clients at all states of growth.


2004 Compared to

Net Income (Loss)
Before Taxes

SVB Capital’s loss before taxes for 2004 of $0.8
million represented a $0.4 million decrease compared to a loss of $0.4 million
for 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in
noninterest expense partially offset by a slight increase in interest income
and an increase in noninterest income.  As a note of reference, prior to 2005, the
exercise of derivative equity warrant assets were reported under SVB Capital. This
line has been reclassified to the Commercial Bank.

Net interest income for 2004 of $11.8 million
represented a $0.8 million increase, or 6.8%, from $11.1 million for 2003.

Noninterest income for 2004 of $5.3 million
represented a $3.4 million increase, from $1.9 million for 2003 primarily due
to an increase in net securities gains. For internal purposes, SVB Capital
reports interest income, non-interest income, and expense net of minority
interest. Therefore, these lines represent the net investment gains or losses
attributable to the minority interest holders in these managed funds.

Noninterest expense for 2004 of $17.9 million
represented a $4.6 million, or 34.2% increase from $13.3 million for 2003. The
increase in noninterest expense is primarily attributed to professional fees
and compensation and benefits.

Financial Condition

SVB Capital had an increase in average deposits of
$34.3 million, or 7.1%, and an increase in average loans of $12.0 million, or
18.5%, during 2004 compared to 2003. The growth in average deposits and average
loans was due to various market factors, including an improved funds flow
environment for SVB Capital’s client base, venture capital, and private equity
firms, as well as our initiatives to serve clients at all states of growth.

SVB Alliant

2005 Compared to

Net Income (Loss)
Before Taxes

SVB Alliant’s loss before income taxes of $0.3 million
for 2005 represented a $2.6 million improvement, compared to a $2.9 million
loss for 2004. The increase was primarily a result of lower expenses in 2005.

Noninterest expense of $22.4 million in 2005
represented a decrease of $2.6 million, compared to $24.9 million for 2004.  The decrease was primarily due to variable
compensation costs.

Financial Condition

SVB Alliant’s average total assets were slightly lower
in 2005 by $1.8 million.

2004 Compared
to  2003

Net Income (Loss)
Before Taxes

SVB Alliant’s loss before income taxes of $2.9 million
for 2004 represented a $60.7 million improvement, compared to a $63.6 million
loss for 2003. The increase was primarily a result of goodwill impairment
charges of $63.0 million in 2003.

Noninterest income of $22.0 million in 2004
represented an increase of $9.8 million, or 80.5%, compared to $12.2 million in
2003. The increase was primarily attributable to one single large transaction,
which generated $6.1 million in fees in the second quarter of 2004.

Noninterest expense of $24.9 million in 2004
represented a decrease of $50.8 million, compared to $75.8 million for 2003.
The decrease was primarily due to impairment of goodwill charges of $17.0
million and $46.0 million incurred during the second and fourth quarters of
2003, respectively. This was partially offset by increases in compensation and
benefits expense of $10.9 million. Of this increase, $6.9 million was


attributable to increased
incentive compensation, $1.6 million was attributable to increased employee
base compensation, $1.2 million was attributable to increased employee
benefits, and $0.9 million was attributable to increased stock-based
compensation expense.

Financial Condition

SVB Alliant’s average total assets were lower for 2004
due to impairment charges of goodwill of $17.0 million and $46.0 million
recorded in the second and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively. Please see Item 8—Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7. Goodwill for further
discussion.

Other Business
Services

The Other Business Services segment is principally
comprised of Private Client Services, Global Financial Services, and Other business
service units that are not part of the Commercial Bank, SVB Capital, or SVB
Alliant segments. The Private Client Services Group and Global Financial
Services Group, do not meet the separate reporting thresholds as defined by
SFAS No. 131 and as such has been combined with other business service
units for segment reporting purposes. The Private Client Services Group
provides a wide range of credit services to high-net-worth individuals using
both long-term secured and short-term unsecured lines of credit. Those products
and services include home equity lines of credit, secured lines of credit,
restricted stock purchase loans, airplane loans, and capital call lines of
credit.  Global Financial Services
supports venture capital and commercial banking clients with business services
through subsidiaries in India, United Kingdom, and China.

The Other
Business Services segment reflects those adjustments necessary to reconcile the
results of operating segments based on our 
internal profitability reporting process to the consolidated financial
statements prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles applicable to consolidated financial statements.

Financial Condition

Our total assets were $5.5 billion at December 31,
2005, an increase of $396.0 million, or 7.7%, compared to $5.1 billion at December 31,
2004.

Federal Funds Sold,
Securities Purchased under Agreement to Resell, and Other Investment Securities

Federal funds sold, securities purchased under
agreement to resell and other short-term investments totaled a combined
$175.7 million at December 31, 2005, a decrease of $167.4 million, or
48.8% as compared to $343.0 million outstanding at the prior year end. The
lower levels of federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreement to
resell and other short-term investments at December 31, 2005, as compared
to the prior year end reflect our current strategy of investing available funds
in high quality loan opportunities. Our plan is to continue the trend of
managing federal funds sold and overnight repurchase agreements at appropriate
levels.

Investment
Securities

Investment securities totaled $2.0 billion at December 31,
2005, a decrease of $16.9 million, or 0.8%, from $2.1 billion at December 31,
2004. The decrease was comprised of a $76.0 million decrease in available for
sale securities, concentrated in mortgage-backed securities, partially offset
by an increase in venture capital and other private equity investments. See
Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6.
Investment Securities.

For a description of the accounting policies related
to Investment Securities, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and
Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2.
Significant Accounting Policies—Investment Securities.


The following table
details the composition of investment securities at December 31, 2005,
2004, and 2003:

(1)

Includes $8.6 million, related to investments owned by
two consolidated limited partnerships, Taurus Growth Partners, LP and Libra
Partners, LP as of December 31, 2003. The Taurus Growth Partners, LP and
Libra Partners, LP funds were liquidated and the funds were fully distributed
as of December 2004. We had a controlling interest of less than 1% in the
funds.

(2)

Includes $0.5 million related to Silicon Valley
BancVentures, LP at December 31, 2004. We have a controlling interest of
10.7% in the fund.

(3)

Includes $58.7 million, $45.3 million, and $30.1
million, related to our fund of funds, SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP, as of December 31,
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. We have a controlling ownership interest of
12.6% in the fund. It also includes $22.1 million and $7.3 million related to
SVB Strategic Investors Fund II, LP, at December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004. We have a controlling ownership interest of 8.6% in the fund. Additionally,
it includes $0.5 million, related to SVB Strategic Investors Fund III, LP at December 31,
2005. We have a controlling ownership interest of 100.0% in the fund.

(4)

Includes $26.8 million, $15.7 million, and $10.1
million, related to our venture capital fund, Silicon Valley BancVentures, LP,
as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We have a
controlling ownership interest of 10.7% in the fund.

(5)

Includes $25.3 million and $9.0 million related to
Partners for Growth, LP at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004,
respectively. We have a majority ownership interest of 50.01% in the fund.

(6)

Includes $5.3 million and $2.4 million related to Gold
Hill Venture Lending Partners 03, LLC, the general partner of Gold Hill Venture
Lending Partners 03, LP, at December 31, 2005 and December 21, 2004,
respectively. We have a majority interest of 90.7% in Gold Hill Venture Lending
Partners 03, LLC. Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners 03, LLC has ownership
interest of 5.0% in the fund. It also included $5.4 million and $2.3 million
related to Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners 03, LP, as of December 31,
2005 and December 31, 2004. We have a direct ownership interest of 4.8% in
the fund.


2005 Compared to

Available-for-Sale
Investments

Available-for-sale
investment securities totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2005, a
decrease of $76.0 million, or 3.9%, from the December 31, 2004 balance of
$1.9 billion. This decrease was due primarily to principal prepayments on
mortgage-backed securities and a reduction in obligations of state and
political subdivisions from normal maturities and calls. During the year, we
added an allocation to commercial mortgage-backed securities totaling $69.4 million.
During 2005, the duration of the fixed income investment portfolio increased to
2.9 years at December 31, 2005 from 2.1 years at December 31, 2004,
in conjunction with our active interest rate risk management program. Discount
notes and bonds, asset-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations also decreased.

Non-Marketable
Securities

The overall increase in
non-marketable securities of $59.6 million was primarily related to an increase
in venture capital fund investments of $28.7 million and an increase of $22.7
million in other investments between 2005 and 2004. The increase of $28.7
million in venture capital fund investments is due to additional investments
made by our managed funds, SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP and SVB Strategic
Investors Fund II, LP. In 2005, SVB Financial Group raised the fourth managed
fund, SVB Strategic Investors III, LP. The increase of $22.7 million between
2005 and 2004 in other investments category relates to additional investments
in the two debt funds, Partners for Growth, LP and Gold Hill Venture Lending
Partners, LP.

Investment
Concentration

At December 31, 2005,
except for securities issued by the U.S. Government or by U.S. government
agencies and corporations, we held no investment securities that were issued by
a single party that exceeded 10.0% of our stockholders’ equity.

2004 Compared to

Available-for-Sale
Investments

Available-for-sale
investment securities totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2004, an
increase of $494.5 million, or 34.5%, for the December 31, 2003 balance of
$1.4 billion. This increase primarily resulted from a shift of funds from
federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreement to resell and other
short-term investments to the available-for-sale investment securities
portfolio. Furthermore, excess liquidity generated by growth in deposits in
excess of loan growth was invested in the available-for-sale investment
portfolio. The increase in available-for-sale securities was concentrated in
higher-yielding mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage-backed
obligations. During 2004, we increased the duration of the fixed income
investment portfolio to 2.1 years at December 31, 2004 from 1.7 years at December 31,
2003, in conjunction with our active interest rate risk management program. Asset-backed
securities also increased, which was partially offset by a decrease in
obligations of states and political subdivisions.

Non-Marketable
Securities (Investment Company Fair Value Accounting)

The increase in the other
investments category of non-marketable securities was related to investments in
two venture debt funds. Additionally, venture capital funds and other private
equity investments increased due to increases in the market value of certain
investments in our managed funds SVB Strategic Investors Fund, LP and Silicon
Valley Banc Ventures, LP, and further investments made into our managed funds. For
further information see footnotes 2 and 6 of the investment securities table
above.


Investment
Concentration

At December 31, 2004,
except for securities issued by the U.S. Government or by U.S. government
agencies and corporations, we held no investment securities that were issued by
a single party that exceeded 10.0% of our stockholders’ equity.

Investment
Securities—Remaining Contractual Principal Maturities

The
following table provides the remaining contractual principal maturities and
fully taxable-equivalent yields on investment securities as of December 31,
2005. Interest income on certain obligations of states and political
subdivision (non-taxable investments) are presented on a fully tax-equivalent
basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. The weighted-average yield
is computed using the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities, which
are reported at fair value. Expected remaining maturities of callable U.S.
agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage
obligations may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because
borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without penalties. This
is most apparent in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations as contractual maturities are typically 15 to 30 years whereas
expected average lives of these securities are significantly shorter and vary
based upon structure. Venture capital fund investments, other private equity
investments, other investments and low income tax credit funds are included in
the table below as maturing after 10 years.

(1)

Available for sale.

Callable U.S. agency
securities, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage obligations
pose risks not associated with fixed maturity bonds, primarily related to the
ability of the borrower to call or prepay the debt with or without penalty.
This risk, known as call risk and prepayment risk, may result in these
securities having longer or shorter average lives than anticipated at the time
of purchase. As interest rates decline, prepayments generally tend to increase;
causing the average expected remaining maturity to shorten. Conversely, as interest
rates rise, prepayments tend to decrease causing the average expected remaining
maturity to extend.


Loans

The following table details the composition of the
loan portfolio, net of unearned income for each year ended December 31:

(1)

Unearned
income was $20.6 million, $18.4 million, $14.4 million, $13.8 million, and
$13.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, and
2001, respectively.

The following table sets forth the remaining
contractual maturity distribution of our gross loans at December 31, 2005,
for fixed and variable rate loans:


Upon maturity, loans satisfying our credit quality
standards may be eligible for renewal. Such renewals are subject to the normal
underwriting and credit administration practices associated with new loans. We
do not grant loans with unconditional extension terms.

A
substantial percentage of our loans are commercial in nature, and such loans
are generally made to emerging-growth or corporate technology companies in a
variety of industries. The breakdown of total loans by industry sector is as
follows:

(1)

No other industry sector
represented more than 10.0% of total gross loans at December 31, 2005 or
2004.

As of December 31, 2005, our asset-based lending
represents 12.9% of total gross loans and account receivable factoring
represent 10.9% of total gross loans.

Approximately 48% and 13%
of our outstanding gross loan balances are in the states of California and
Massachusetts, respectively. There are no other states with balances greater
than 10%.

Loan Administration

Authority over our loan policies resides with our
Board of Directors. This authority is managed through the approval and periodic
review of our loan policies. The Board of Directors delegates authority to the
Directors’ Loan Committee to supervise our loan underwriting, approval, and
monitoring activities. The Directors’ Loan Committee consists of outside Board
of Director members and our Chief Executive Officer, who serves as an
alternate.

Subject to the oversight
of the Directors’ Loan Committee, lending authority is delegated to the Chief
Credit Officer and our loan committee, which consists of the Chief Credit
Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and other senior members of our lending
management. Requests for new and existing credits that meet certain size and
underwriting criteria may be approved outside of our loan committee by
designated senior lenders or jointly with a or Senior Credit Officer or
Division Risk Manager.

of year end.

The allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $36.8
million at December 31, 2005 a decrease of $0.8 million, or 2.2%, as
compared to $37.6 million at December 31, 2004. Our strong credit quality
necessitated a decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses. This decrease
was due to net charge-offs of $1.1 million and a provision for loan and lease
losses of $(0.2) million. The 2005 net charge-off amount was composed of $12.4
million in gross charge-offs and $11.4 million in gross recoveries.

The allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $37.6
million at December 31, 2004, a decrease of $12.2 million, or 24.6%,
as compared to $49.9 million at December 31, 2003. Our strong credit
quality necessitated a decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses.
This decrease was due to net charge-offs of $2.0 million and a provision for
loan and lease losses of $(10.3) million. The 2004 net charge-off amount was
composed of $16.2 million in gross charge-offs and $14.2 million in gross
recoveries.

The allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $49.9
million at December 31, 2003, a decrease of $8.5 million, or 14.6%,
as compared to $58.4 million at December 31, 2002. Our improved credit
quality necessitated a decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses.
This decrease was due to net recoveries of $1.4 million and a provision for
loan losses of $(9.9) million. Our loan recoveries in 2003 included


settlement of the
remaining recovery of film loan litigation. The 2003 net recovery amount was
composed of $19.0 million in gross charge-offs and $20.4 million in gross
recoveries.

The allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $58.4
million at December 31, 2002, an increase of $1.5 million, or 2.6%,
as compared to $56.9 million at December 31, 2001. This decrease was due
to net charge-offs of $4.4 million and a provision for loan losses of $5.9
million. Our loan recoveries in 2002 primarily related to film loans, which
were charge off in 2000. The 2002 net charge-off amount was composed of $26.6
million in gross charge-offs and $22.2 million in gross recoveries.

The allowance for loan and
lease losses totaled $56.9 million at December 31, 2001. The 2001 gross
charge-offs included one entertainment credit totaling $3.8 million. Of the
total 2001 gross charge-offs, $4.9 million were classified as nonperforming
loans at the end of 2000. The 2001 gross recoveries included three credits, one
from our technology industry sector and two from our discontinued entertainment
and healthcare niches, totaling $12.0 million.

Nonperforming
Assets

Nonperforming
assets consist of loans that are past due 90 days or more that are still
accruing interest, loans on nonaccrual status, other real estate owned (OREO),
and other foreclosed assets. The OREO and other foreclosed assets balance at December 31,
2005 was $6.3 million. We held no OREO or other foreclosed assets at December 31,
2004, 2003, 2002, or 2001. The table below sets forth certain data and ratios
between nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets, and the allowance for loan
and lease losses. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, our nonaccrual loans
represented all impaired loans. We measure all loans placed on nonaccrual
status for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral or
the net present value of the expected cash flows in accordance with SFAS No. 114,
“Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.”  For all periods presented except 2005,
nonperforming loans equaled nonperforming assets.

Nonaccrual Loans

The
detailed composition of nonaccrual loans is presented in the following table.


Nonperforming Loans

Nonperforming loans totaled $7.5 million at December 31,
2005, a decrease of $7.4 million, or 49.5%, from the $14.9 million total at December 31,
2004. The relatively low levels of nonperforming loans at December 31,
2005 and 2004 reflect an improved economic environment experienced by our
clients as well as our ability to effectively manage client credit risk through
our strategic focus on the technology, life science, premium wine, and private
equity industries. Of the total nonperforming loans at year end 2004, $1.5
million were charged off, $4.9 million remained on nonperforming status, and
$8.6 million were returned to accrual status or repaid during 2005. Additionally,
$2.7 million in loans were placed on nonperforming status during 2005 and were
still classified as nonperforming loans at December 31, 2005.

Nonperforming loans totaled $14.9 million at December 31,
2004, an increase of $2.6 million, or 21.0%, from the $12.4 million total at December 31,
2003. The relatively low levels of nonperforming loans at December 31,
2004 and 2003 reflect an improved economic environment experienced by our
clients as well as our ability to effectively manage client credit risk through
our strategic focus on the technology, life science, premium wine, and private
equity industries. Of the total nonperforming loans at year end 2003, $1.1
million were charged off, $5.9 million remained on nonperforming status, and
$5.4 million were returned to accrual status or repaid during 2004. Additionally,
$9.0 million in loans were placed on nonperforming status during 2004 and were
still classified as nonperforming loans at December 31, 2004.

Nonperforming loans totaled $12.4 million at December 31,
2003, a decrease of $8.1 million, 39.5%, from the $20.4 million total at December 31,
2002. The reduction in nonperforming loans reflected the improved economic
conditions experienced by our clients as well as our ability to manage client
credit risk through our strategic focus on the technology, life science,
premium wine, and private equity industries. Of the total nonperforming loans
at year end 2002, $2.3 million were charged off, $1.2 million remained on
nonperforming status, and $16.9 million were repaid during 2003. Additionally,
$11.2 million in loans were placed on nonperforming status during 2003 and were
still classified as nonperforming loans at December 31, 2003.

Nonperforming loans totaled $20.4 million at
December 31, 2002, an increase of $2.1 million, or 11.5%, from the $18.3
million total at December 31, 2001. Of the total nonperforming loans at
year end 2001, $8.4 million were charged off, $1.6 million remained on
nonperforming status, $8.0 million were repaid during 2002, and $0.3 million
were upgraded to performing status. Additionally, $15.8 million in loans were
placed on nonperforming status during 2002 and were still classified as
nonperforming loans at the end of 2002.

Impaired loans totaled
$6.5 million, $14.3 million and $12.4 million at December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. If the impaired loans for 2005, 2004 and 2003 had not
been impaired, $1.0 million, $1.1 million, and $1.0 million in interest
income would have been recognized during the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill totaled $35.6
million at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. All of our
goodwill at December 31, 2005 and 2004 pertained to the acquisition of SVB
Alliant.

SVB Alliant

During the second and fourth quarters of 2004, we used
a consulting firm to conduct an impairment review of SVB Alliant in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, based primarily on forecasted
discounted cash flow analyses. The valuation analysis of SVB Alliant for each
review indicated no further impairment beyond that already identified and
recorded.


During the second quarter of 2003, we conducted an
annual impairment review of SVB Alliant, which elicited an indication of
possible impairment. Despite an increase in revenues during the second quarter
of 2003 compared to the first quarter of 2003, SVB Alliant failed to achieve
the revenues projected by the financial model used to value it in connection
with its original acquisition by us. In response to these indications, we
engaged an internationally reputable business consulting firm to assist us in a
valuation of SVB Alliant, in compliance with the requirements of SFAS No. 142.
Based on this valuation, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.0 million
during the second quarter of 2003.

During the fourth quarter
of 2003, it became apparent that the operating results of SVB Alliant during
the second half of 2003 were substantially below the performance forecasted in
connection with the second quarter analysis, primarily due to decreased fees
associated with weak initial public offering (IPO) and mergers and acquisitions
environments. We engaged the same business-consulting firm that assisted us
with the annual impairment review during the second quarter of 2003 to assist
us in conducting a valuation of SVB Alliant, in compliance with the
requirements of SFAS No. 142. Based on this valuation, we recorded an
impairment charge of $46.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2003. The total
impairment charge for 2003 was $63.0 million.

Woodside Asset
Management, Inc.

During the third quarter
of 2004, we conducted an annual impairment review of Woodside Asset Management, Inc.,
which indicated possible impairment. Based primarily on an internal analysis of
forecasted discounted cash flows, we recorded an impairment charge for the
entire goodwill amount of $1.9 million during the third quarter of 2004.
Woodside Asset Management, Inc. failed to achieve or exceed the projected
operating results used as the basis of its valuation in connection with our
original acquisition of the business.

Federal Home Loan
Bank(“FHLB”) and Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) Stock

Our Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and Federal
Reserve Bank (“FRB”) stock are restricted, as we are required to hold shares of
FHLB and FRB stock under the Bank’s borrowing agreement.

Derivatives

2005 compared to

The gross positive fair values of derivative assets
are recorded as a component of the other assets line item on the balance sheet.
The gross negative fair values of derivative liabilities are recorded as a
component of other liabilities line item on the balance sheet.

Derivative
assets are recorded as a component of other assets and liabilities and are
comprised of the following:


Equity warrant assets decreased by $1.1 million. The
fair value related to exercise of equity warrant assets into equity securities
caused a decrease of $11.8 million (as of the respective dates of exercise). Aggregate
grant date fair value of new equity warrant assets of $7.4 million was added to
the portfolio. Additionally, the decrease in fair value of our equity warrant
assets attributable to cancellations and expirations was $3.0 million. Lastly,
a $6.3 million increase was related to changes in the fair value of the
remaining equity warrant assets.

The fair value of foreign exchange forward and option
contracts increased by $1.2 million.

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with
clients involved in international trade finance activities, either as the
purchaser or seller of foreign currency at a future date, depending upon the
clients’ need. We enter into an opposite way foreign exchange forward contract
with a correspondent bank to economically hedge these contracts, which
mitigates the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for each
of the foreign exchange forward contracts entered into with our clients. These
contracts are short term in nature, typically expiring within one year. We also
enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with correspondent banks to
economically hedge foreign exchange risk related to certain foreign currency
denominated loans. At December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the
aggregate notional amounts of these contracts totaled $432.7 million and $525.4
million, respectively. The maximum credit exposure for counter-party
nonperformance for foreign exchange forward contracts with both clients and
correspondent banks amounted to $5.7 million at December 31, 2005 and
$10.0 million at December 31, 2004. We have not experienced nonperformance
by a counter party and therefore have not incurred related losses. Further, we
anticipate performance by all counter-parties to such foreign exchange forward
contracts.

We enter into foreign
currency option contracts with clients involved in international trade finance
activities, either as the purchaser or seller of foreign currency options,
depending upon the clients’ need. We enter into an opposite way foreign
currency option contract with a correspondent bank, which completely mitigates
the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for each of the
currency option contracts entered into with our clients. These contracts
typically expire in less than one year. At December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004, the aggregate notional amounts of these contracts totaled $18.8 million
and $13.5 million, respectively. We have not experienced nonperformance by
a counter party and therefore have not incurred related losses. Further, we
anticipate performance by all counter-parties. Our maximum credit risk to
nonperformance of counterparties is $34.1 million.

2004 compared to

The
gross positive fair values of derivative assets are recorded as a component of
the other assets line item on the balance sheet. The gross negative fair values
of derivative liabilities are recorded as a component of the other liabilities
line item on the balance sheet. Derivatives are comprised of the following:

Equity warrant assets decreased by $0.6 million. The
fair value related to exercise of derivative equity warrant assets into equity
securities caused a decrease of $6.3 million as of the respective dates of
exercise,


while $7.2 million in
aggregate grant date fair value of new equity warrant assets was added to the
portfolio. Additionally, the decrease in fair value of our equity warrant
assets attributable to cancellations and expirations was $2.4 million. Lastly,
a $0.9 million increase was related to an increase in the fair value of the
remaining equity warrant assets.

The fair value of foreign exchange forward and option
contracts decreased by $0.4 million.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the aggregate
notional amounts of client related foreign exchange forward contracts totaled
$525.4 million and $155.8 million, respectively. The maximum credit exposure
for counterparty nonperformance for foreign exchange forward contracts with
both clients and correspondent banks amounted to $10.0 million at December 31,
2004 and $3.5 million at December 31, 2003. We have not experienced
nonperformance by a counterparty and therefore have not incurred related
losses. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such
foreign exchange forward contracts.

At December 31, 2004
and 2003, the notional amounts of client related foreign currency contracts
totaled $13.5 million and $21.1 million, respectively. We have not
experienced nonperformance by a counterparty and therefore have not incurred
related losses. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties. These
contracts typically expire in less than one year.

Convertible Note
Hedge

On May 15, 2003, we
entered into a convertible note hedge agreement (purchased call option) with a
counterparty, with respect to our common stock, to limit our exposure to
potential dilution from conversion of our $150.0 million principal amount of
zero coupon convertible notes. For information on the our $150.0 million
principal amount of zero coupon convertible notes, see Borrowings below. Upon
the occurrence of conversion events, we have the right to purchase up to
approximately 4,460,610 shares of its common stock from the counterparty at a
price of $33.6277 per common share. The convertible note hedge agreement will
expire on June 15, 2008. We have the option to settle any amounts due
under the convertible hedge either in cash or net shares of our common stock.
The cost of the convertible note hedge is included in stockholders’ equity in
accordance with the guidance in EITF No. 00-19, Accounting for
Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a
Company’s Own Stock. Also see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 13. Derivative Financial Instruments for
additional discussion.

Deposits

Our
deposits are largely obtained from clients within our technology, life science,
private equity, and premium wine industry sectors and, to a lesser extent, from
individuals served by private client services. We do not obtain deposits from
conventional retail sources and have no brokered deposits. The following table
presents the composition of our deposits for the last five years ended December 31:


Total deposits were $4.3 billion at December 31,
2005, an increase of $33.2 million, or 0.8%, from the prior year end total of
$4.2 billion. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased as a percentage of
total deposits to 69.0% at December 31, 2005 from 62.8% at
December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, we held overdraft balances
of $4.1 million, which were included in commercial loans.

Total deposits were $4.2 billion at December 31,
2004, an increase of $552.7 million, or 15.1%, from the prior year end total of
$3.7 billion. The increase in client deposits was concentrated in noninterest
bearing demand deposits and reflects our efforts to penetrate the corporate
technology industry sector, an improved venture capital funding environment,
and our various initiatives to drive business.

Total deposits were $3.7 billion at December 31,
2003, an increase of $230.8 million, or 6.7%, from the prior year-end total of
$3.4 billion. The increase in deposits reflected an improved funding
environment, increased venture capital fund activity, and our various
initiatives to drive business. Our noninterest-bearing demand deposits
increased $294.3 million, or 15.6%, and money market deposits increased $147.3 million
or 15.8%. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in time deposits
of $210.1 million, or 35.7% from the prior year end.

Total deposits were $3.4 billion at December 31,
2002, an increase of $55.3 million, or 1.6%, from the prior year end total of
$3.4 billion. Although our total period-end client deposit balances remained
fairly consistent between 2002 and 2001, we experienced a shift in the
composition of deposit balances. Our noninterest bearing demand deposits
increased $154.6 million, or 8.9%, and money market deposits increased $38.3
million or 4.3%. These increases were largely offset by a decrease in time
deposits of $133.7 million, or 18.5% from the prior year end.

The
aggregate amount of time deposit accounts individually exceeding $100,000
totaled $272.2 million at December 31, 2005, and $286.7 million at
December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, substantially all time
deposit accounts exceeding $100,000 were scheduled to mature within one year.
No material portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single depositor
and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect our business.

Borrowings

Contingently
Convertible Debt

On May 20, 2003, we
issued $150.0 million of zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes at face
value, due June 15, 2008, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act of 1933 and outside the United States to non-US
persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The notes are
convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of $33.6277 per share
and are subordinated to all our present and future senior debt. Holders of the
notes may convert their notes only under certain conditions. See Item 8.
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11.
Borrowings for further information.

Junior Subordinated
Debentures

On October 30, 2003,
we issued $51.5 million in 7.0% junior subordinated debentures. A portion of
the proceeds were used to complete an early redemption of the existing $40.0
million of 8.25% trust


preferred
securities. The remainder of the proceeds is being used for general corporate
purposes. For further information, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11. Borrowings.

Trust Preferred
Securities

In May 1998, we issued $40.0 million in
cumulative trust preferred securities through a newly formed special-purpose
trust, SVB Capital I. We completed the early redemption of these trust
preferred securities effective December 1, 2003. At the time of
redemption, the remaining unamortized issuance costs of $1.3 million
related to the trust preferred securities were expensed.

The trust was a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary
of SVB Financial and its sole assets were the junior subordinated deferrable
interest debentures. Distributions were cumulative and were payable quarterly
at a rate of 8.25% per annum of the stated liquidation amount of $25 per
preferred security. We fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of
the trust on a subordinated basis.

On June 3, 2002, we entered into an interest rate
swap, which provided an economic hedge against the risk of changes in fair
value associated with our $40.0 million, 8.25% fixed rate trust preferred
securities. This agreement provided a benefit of $1.0 million in 2003. The swap
was terminated on June 23, 2003. The change in fair value of this contract
was recorded in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income
throughout the life of the swap.

Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity for the impact of adoption of
SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.”

Available Lines of
Credit

As of December 31,
2005, we had available $441.0 million in federal funds line of credit, of which
$236.0 million were unused. In addition to the available federal funds lines,
Silicon Valley Bank has reverse repurchase agreement lines available with
multiple securities dealers. Reverse repurchase lines allow Silicon Valley Bank
to finance short-term borrowings using various fixed income securities as
collateral. At December 31, 2005, Silicon Valley Bank had used $74.5
million of its reverse repurchase lines.

Capital Resources

Our management seeks to
maintain adequate capital to support anticipated asset growth and credit risks,
and to ensure that SVB Financial and Silicon Valley Bank are in compliance with
all regulatory capital guidelines. Our primary sources of new capital include
the issuance of common stock, as well as retained earnings.

Common Stock

$75.0 million share
repurchase authorized by our Board of Directors effective January 27,
2005.

On January 27, 2005,
we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an
additional $75.0 million of common stock under our stock repurchase program, in
conjunction with the $160.0 million originally approved in May 2003. The
additional $75.0 million of shares may be repurchased at any time, at our
discretion, before June 30, 2006, in the open market, through block trades
or otherwise, pursuant to applicable securities laws. Depending on market
conditions, availability of funds, and other relevant factors, the repurchase
of the additional shares may be commenced or suspended at any time prior to June 30,
2006, without any prior notice. Since May 2003 when the program was
approved by the Board of Directors, we have repurchased 6.5 million shares
totaling $203.5 million as of December 31,


2005. The
approximate dollar value of shares that may still be repurchased under this
program is $31.5 million.

$160.0 million
share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, effective May 7,

On May 7, 2003, we announced that our Board of
Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $160.0 million. This program
became effective immediately and replaced previously announced stock repurchase
programs. Under this program, we repurchased in aggregate 0.3 million shares of
common stock totaling $12.6 million in 2004. In 2003, we repurchased in
aggregate 4.5 million shares of common stock totaling $113.2 million. On May 20,
2003, we purchased 1.3 million shares of common stock for approximately $33.4
million in conjunction with our convertible note offering. Additionally, during
the second quarter of 2003, we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase
(ASR) agreement for approximately 3.2 million shares at an initial price of
$79.9 million. We completed our settlement obligations under this ASR agreement
in the third quarter of 2003. See below for terms of this agreement, which are
substantially the same as ASR agreements we entered into in January 2003
and November 2002.

From time to time, we may
implement a non-discretionary Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, under which
we will automatically repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a
predetermined formula for a specified period of time.

Stockholders’
Equity

Stockholders’ equity totaled $569.3 million at December 31,
2005, an increase of $27.4 million, or 5.0%, from the $541.9 million balance at
December 31, 2004. This increase in 2005, as compared to 2004, was
primarily due to the net income of $92.5 million and proceeds from stock
issuances under employee stock purchase and option program, partially offset by
the repurchase of 1.7 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase
price of $77.7 million. We have not paid a cash dividend on our common stock
since 1992, and we do not have any material commitments for capital
expenditures as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, there
are no plans for payment of dividends.

Funds generated through retained earnings are a
significant source of capital and liquidity and are expected to continue to be
so in the future. Our management engages in ongoing capital planning process in
an effort to make effective use of the capital available to us. The capital
plan considers capital needs for the foreseeable future and allocates capital
to both existing business activities and expected future business activities.
Expected future activities for which capital is set aside include potential
product expansions and acquisitions of new business lines.

Both SVB Financial and Silicon Valley Bank are subject
to capital adequacy guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve Board. Under these
capital guidelines, the minimum total risk-based capital ratio and Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio requirements are 10.0% and 6.0%, respectively.

The Federal Reserve Board has also established minimum
capital leverage ratio guidelines for state member banks. The ratio is
determined using Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets. The
guidelines require a minimum of 5.0% for a well-capitalized depository
institution. For further information on risk-based capital and leverage ratios
as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, see “Part I. Item 1. Business—Supervision
and Regulation—Regulatory Capital.”

Both SVB Financial and Silicon Valley Bank’s capital
ratios were in excess of regulatory guidelines for a well-capitalized
depository institution as of December 31, 2005, and December 31,
2004.

A part of the dividends
paid in 2003 and the dividend paid in 2004 were in excess of the amount
permitted under the California State Department of Financial Institutions (DFI)
guidelines. Therefore, SVB Financial was required by the DFI to return to
Silicon Valley Bank a portion of the 2003 dividend and the 2004 dividend—the
total amount returned totaled $28.4 million. At December 31, 2005, under
these


regulatory
restrictions, the remaining amount available for payment of dividends to SVB
Financial by Silicon Valley Bank totaled $95.0 million.

Credit Rating

Standard & Poor’s Rating Services assigned
SVB Financial its BBB- long-term counterparty credit rating in December 2003,
and there has been no change to that rating. Standard & Poor’s
assigned its BBB counterparty credit rating to Silicon Valley Bank. An issuer
rated BBB is defined as having an adequate capacity to meet its financial
commitments, however, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are
more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial
commitments. According to Standard & Poor’s, the outlook for both SVB
Financial and Silicon Valley Bank is stable.

SVB Financial’s credit
rating by Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) at December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004 was Baa1 for issuer rating. According to Moody’s, issuers rated Baa offer
adequate financial security. However, certain protective elements may be
lacking or may be unreliable over any great period of time. Silicon Valley Bank’s
credit rating by Moody’s at December 31, 2003 was A3 for issuer rating, A3
for long-term deposits, P-2 for short-term deposits, and C for financial
strength. Moody’s bank deposit ratings are opinions of a bank’s ability to
repay punctually its foreign and/or domestic currency deposit obligations.
According to Moody’s an A rating for deposits represents good credit quality,
however, elements may be present that suggest a susceptibility to impairment
over the long-term. Banks rated P-2 by Moody’s for short-term deposits
offer strong credit quality and a strong capacity for timely payment of
short-term deposit obligations. Financial strength ratings represent Moody’s
opinion of a bank’s intrinsic safety and soundness and, as such, exclude
certain external credit risks and credit support elements that are addressed by
Moody’s bank deposit ratings. Banks rated C possess adequate intrinsic
financial strength and are typically institutions with more limited but still
valuable business franchises, good financial fundamentals, and a predictable
and stable operating environment. According to Moody’s, the outlook for both
SVB Financial and Silicon Valley Bank is positive.

Liquidity

An important objective of the asset/liability
management committee (ALCO) is to manage liquidity. The objective of liquidity
management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet
loan demand, to meet depositors’ needs, and to service other liabilities as
they become due without causing an undue amount of cost or risk and without causing
a disruption to normal operating conditions.

We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of
projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical
deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and economic
conditions, individual client funding needs, and existing and planned business
activities. Our ALCO provides oversight to the liquidity management process and
recommends policy guidelines, subject to our Board of Directors’ approval, and
courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity needs.

The ability to attract a stable, low-cost base of
deposits is our primary source of liquidity. We continue to expand on
opportunities to increase our liquidity. In the third quarter of 2002, we became
a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco adding to our liquidity
channels. Other sources of liquidity available to us include federal funds
purchased, repurchase agreements, and other short-term borrowing arrangements.
Our liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of our portfolio of
liquid assets. Our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash
equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal
business operations, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale
agreements, investment securities maturing within six months, investment
securities eligible and available for financing


or pledging purposes with
a maturity in excess of six months, and anticipated near-term cash flows from
investments.

Our policy guidelines provide that liquid assets as a
percentage of total deposits should not fall below 20.0%. Our ratio of liquid
assets to total deposits was 39.6% and 47.6% at December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively, both well in excess of our minimum policy guidelines. In
addition to monitoring the level of liquid assets relative to total deposits,
we also utilize other policy measures in our liquidity management activities.
As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we were in compliance with all of these
policy measures.

On a
stand-alone basis, SVB Financial’s primary liquidity channels include dividends
from Silicon Valley Bank, its investment portfolio assets, and its ability to
raise debt and capital. The ability of Silicon Valley Bank to pay dividends is
subject to certain regulations; see Item 1. Business—Supervision and
Regulation—Restriction on Dividends.

In analyzing our liquidity for 2005, 2004 and 2003,
reference is made to our consolidated statement of cash flows for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003; see Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplemental Data. The statement of cash flows includes separate
categories for operating, investing, and financing activities.

Cash provided by operating activities for 2005 was
$113.6 million, which included net income of $92.5 million. Adjustments
for noncash items included $9.8 million in tax benefits related to stock
compensation, $7.9 million of stock-based compensation and $7.8 million of
depreciation and amortization offset by amortization of deferred warrant
related loan fees of $6.1 million, net investment gains of $4.3 million and
changes in fair value of derivatives of $3.3 million. Sources of cash from
changes in other assets and liabilities included a decrease in accounts
receivable of $7.6 million, a decrease in income tax receivable of
$2.0 million and an increase in accrued retention, incentive plan and
other compensation benefits payable of $1.6 million. These sources of cash were
offset by a $9.7 million increase in accrued interest receivable.

Cash used for investing activities was $567.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net cash outflow was primarily
driven by a net increase in loans of $549.4 million and purchases of premises
and equipment of $18.3 million. In addition, purchases of investment securities
of $534.3 million, offset by $27.3 million in proceeds from the sale of
investment securities and $495.4 million in proceeds from maturities and
pay-downs of investment securities also contributed to the net cash outflow.

Cash provided by financing activities was $289.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2005, largely, driven by net
increases in other borrowings of $269.7 million and capital contributions from
minority interest participants net of distributions of $45.4 million. Deposits
and proceeds from the issuance


of common stock also
contributed $33.2 million and $18.6 million, respectively. These sources of
cash were offset by repurchases of our common stock of $77.7 million during 2005.
In 2005, certain holders of $0.1 million of our $150 million contingently
convertible debt (see Financial Condition—Borrowings) elected to exercise their
conversion option rights. We elected to settle the conversions in cash. If our
stock price remains in excess of the conversion price of $33.6277, other
holders may also convert their holdings at any time. These notes are due June 15,
2008.

Cash and cash equivalents were $462.1 million at December 31,
2005.

Cash provided by operating activities for 2004 was
$94.3 million, which included net income of $63.9 million. Adjustments for
noncash items included $9.9 million in tax benefits related to stock
compensation, depreciation and amortization of $8.8 million, and deferred
income tax expense of $5.6 million, offset by a net recovery of loan and
lease losses of $10.3 million, amortization of deferred warrant related loan
fees of $5.7 million and net investment gains of $5.2 million. Sources of cash
from changes in other assets and liabilities included increases in accrued
retention, incentive plans and other compensation benefits payable of $17.3
million and a decrease in income tax receivable of $4.6 million. These sources
of cash were offset by a $7.3 million increase in accounts receivable and an
increase in accrued interest receivable of $3.4 million.

Cash used for investing activities was $876.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net cash outflow was primarily
driven by purchases of investment securities of $1.4 billion, partially offset
by $162.0 million in proceeds from the sale of investment securities and
$729.2 million in proceeds from maturities and pay-downs of investment
securities. A net increase in loans of $341.7 million also contributed to the
net cash outflow.

Cash provided by financing activities was $573.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2004, largely, driven by net
increases in deposits of $552.7 million. Proceeds from the issuance of common
stock and capital contributions from minority interest participants net of
distributions also contributed $25.1 million and $16.9 million,
respectively. These sources of cash were offset by repurchases of our common
stock of $12.6 million during 2004 and a decrease in other borrowings of $8.1
million.

Cash and cash equivalents were $627.2 million at December 31,
2004.

Operating activities for 2003 included net income of
$13.0 million, which was adjusted for certain non-cash items including
impairment of goodwill, recoveries of loan and lease losses, depreciation and
amortization, amortization of deferred warrant related loan fees, deferred
income tax benefit, net losses on investment securities, changes in fair values
of derivatives and an assortment of other miscellaneous items. Investing
activities consisted of transactions in investment securities resulting in a
net cash outflow of $392.5 million and the net change in total loans, which
resulted in a net cash inflow of $77.4 million in 2003. The net cash inflow
associated with loans relate to principal collections offset by loan originations.
The net cash outflow from securities transactions was the net result of
purchases of investment securities, offset by securities maturities and sales.
Financing activities reflected cash inflows of $234.2 million primarily
resulting from a large increase in deposits and inflows from the issuance of
zero-coupon convertible notes and 7.0% junior subordinated debentures.
Financing cash outflows resulted from repurchases of common stock and
redemption of our 8.25% trust preferred securities. In total, the transactions
noted above resulted in a net cash inflow of $10.9 million for 2003 and
total cash and cash equivalents, as defined in our consolidated statement of
cash flows, of $835.3 million at December 31, 2003.


Financial Ratios

The
table below presents the relationship between the following significant
financial ratios:

Both
the capital ratios of SVB Financial and Silicon Valley Bank were in excess of
regulatory guidelines for a well-capitalized depository institution as of December 31,
2005, 2004, and 2003. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 20. Regulatory Matters. Capital ratios for SVB
Financial are set forth below:

December 31,




Total risk-based
  capital ratio

14.74

%

16.09

%

16.83

%

Tier 1 risk-based
  capital ratio

12.39

%

12.75

%

12.23

%

Tier 1 leverage ratio

12.08

%

11.17

%

10.62

%

SVB Financial’s and Silicon Valley Bank’s capital
ratios remained well above the regulatory requirements in 2005. The decline in
total risk-based capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital from 2004 to 2005 was
due to the declining eligibility of the convertible bond as a component of Tier
2 capital due to its remaining maturity. In addition, year-to-date repurchases
of our common stock and growth in risk weighted assets, particularly loans,
partially offset by year-to-date earnings contributed to the decrease.

The decrease in total
risk-based capital from 2003 to 2004 was due to the declining eligibility of
our convertible bond as it approaches maturity. Both Tier 1 and Tier 1 leverage
ratios increased due to the earnings generated by us and Silicon Valley Bank
and the nominal amount of share repurchases executed over the course of the
year. The increases in our Tier 1 risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios
from 2003 to 2004 have been caused in large part to increase in additional
paid-in capital and retained earnings due to higher net income in 2004 as
compared to 2003.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

In the normal course of business, we use financial
instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our
customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit,
commercial and standby letters of credit, foreign exchange options, and foreign
exchange forward contracts. These instruments involve, to varying degrees,
elements of credit risk. Credit risk is defined as the possibility of
sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to
perform in accordance with the terms of the contract.

For a description of
certain off balance-sheet arrangements, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 18. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,
Guarantees, and Other Commitments.


Commitments to
Extend Credit

A commitment to extend
credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no
violation of any condition established in the agreement. Such commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates, or other termination clauses, and
usually require a fee paid by the client upon us issuing the commitment.
Commitments which are available for funding, due to clients meeting all
collateral, compliance, and financial covenants required under loan commitment
agreements, totaled $3.5 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively. Out of these available commitment balances, the fixed-rate
commitments were $325.5 million and $257.2 million at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively. Commitments which are unavailable for funding, due to
clients not meeting all collateral, compliance, and financial covenants
required under loan commitment agreements, totaled $0.9 billion and $0.7
billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our potential
exposure to credit loss, in the event of nonperformance by the other party to
the financial instrument, is the contractual amount of the available unused
loan commitment. We use the same credit approval and monitoring process in
extending loan commitments as we do in making loans. The actual liquidity needs
or the credit risk that we have experienced have historically been lower than
the contractual amount of commitments to extend credit because a significant
portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. We evaluate each
potential borrower and the necessary collateral on an individual basis. The
type of collateral varies, but may include real property, intellectual
property, bank deposits, or business and personal assets. The potential credit
risk associated with these commitments is considered in management’s evaluation
of the adequacy of the liability for unfunded credit commitments. Additionally,
we had aggregate maximum lending limits of $472.7 million and 478.7
million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to our
accounts receivable factoring arrangements. We extend credit under accounts
receivable factoring arrangements when our clients’ sales invoices are deemed
credit worthy under existing underwriting practices.

Commercial and
Standby Letters of Credits

Commercial and standby letters of credit represent
conditional commitments issued by us on behalf of a client to support the
performance of a client to a third party when certain specified future events
have yet to occur. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily for
inventory purchases by clients and are typically short-term in nature. We
provide two types of standby letters of credit, performance and financial
standby letters of credit. Performance standby letters of credit are issued in
connection with the performance of a client to a third party when certain
specified future events have yet to occur. Performance standby letters of
credit are primarily used to support performance instruments such as bid bonds,
performance bonds, lease obligations, repayment of loans, and past due notices.
Financial standby letters of credit are conditional undertakings issued by us
in connection with the payment by a client to a third party (beneficiary).
Financial standby letters of credit are primarily used to support many types of
domestic and international payments. These standby letters of credit have fixed
expiration dates and generally require a fee paid by a client at the time we
issue the commitment. Fees generated from these standby letters of credit are
recognized in noninterest income over the commitment period.

The credit risk involved
in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with
extending loan commitments to clients, and accordingly, we use a credit
evaluation process and collateral requirements similar to those for loan
commitments. Our standby letters of credit often are cash secured by our
clients. The actual liquidity needs or the credit risk that we have experienced
historically have been lower than the contractual amount of letters of credit
issued because a significant portion of these conditional commitments expire
without being drawn upon.


Obligations Under
Guarantees

The
table below summarizes our standby letter of credits at December 31, 2005.
The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the amount that
could be lost under the standby letters of credit if there were a total default
by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under
recourse provisions or from the collateral held or pledged.

At December 31, 2005, the carrying amount of the
liabilities related to financial and performance standby letters of credit was
approximately $4.0 million. At December 31, 2005, cash and investment
securities collateral available to us to reimburse losses under financial and
performance standby letters of credits was $272.2 million. For additional
information regarding these guarantees, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 18. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,
Guarantees and Other Commitments.

Additionally, the Bank, as
a financial provider, routinely guarantees credit cards for some of our
customers which have been provided by an unaffiliated financial institution. The
Bank has recourse against the customer for any amount it is required to pay to
a third party in the event of default under these arrangements. These
guarantees are subject to the same credit policies, underwriting standards and
approval process as loans made by the Bank. Certain of these amounts are
secured by certificates of deposit and other assets which the Bank has rights
to in the event of nonperformance by the customers. The total amount of this guarantee
was $56.3 million at December 31, 2005. The fair value of the liability
associated with this guarantee is not significant.


Commitments to
Invest in Venture Capital Funds

We
make commitments to venture capital fund investments, which in turn make
investments in privately held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds
are generally made up to a ten-year period from the inception of the venture
capital fund. The timing of future cash requirements to fund such commitments
is generally dependent upon the venture capital investment cycle, the overall
market conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately
held companies operate. The following table details our total capital
commitments and our unfunded commitments at December 31, 2005.

(1)

Represents
commitments to 277 of venture capital funds where our ownership interest is
less than 5%.

SVB Capital II
Trust Preferred Securities

In October, 2003, SVB Capital II issued trust
preferred securities that SVB Financial has fully and unconditionally guaranteed,
based on its combined obligations under a guarantee agreement, a trust
agreement, an expense agreement, and a junior subordinated indenture and the
debentures issued under the junior subordinated indenture. SVB Capital II will
redeem the trust preferred securities on October 15, 2033, and may redeem
them earlier, subject to prior approval by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, if then required by the capital rules of the
Federal Reserve Board. For additional information regarding these securities,
see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12.
Commitments and Contingencies.

SVB Financial entered into the guarantee agreement
concurrently with the issuance of the trust preferred securities for the benefit
of the holders of the trust preferred securities. Wilmington Trust Company acts
as guarantee trustee under the guarantee agreement for the purposes of
compliance with the Trust Indenture Act, and the guarantee is qualified as an
indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. The guarantee trustee will hold the
guarantee for the benefit of the holders of the trust preferred securities.

We account for variable interest entities according to
the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46R (revised December 2003),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIE)” or FIN 46R. A VIE is
to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to the majority of
the risk of loss from the VIE’s activities, is entitled to receive the majority
of the entity’s residual returns, or both. As we do not bear the majority of
the risk of loss from the trust preferred securities, they were not
consolidated into our financial statements at December 31, 2005, or December 31,
2004.


Contractual
Obligations and Commercial Commitments

As of December 31,
2005, we, or the funds in which we have an ownership interest and manage, had
the following unfunded contractual obligations and commercial commitments:

(1)

See Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11. Borrowings for further disclosure
related to borrowings.

(2)

See Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 8. Premises and Equipment for further
disclosure related to premises and equipment.

(3)

See Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6. Investment Securities for further
disclosure related to investment securities. We make commitments to venture
capital fund investments. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally
made up to a ten-year period from the inception of the venture capital fund.
The timing of future cash requirements to fund such commitments is generally
dependent upon the venture capital investment cycle, the overall market
conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held
companies operate.

Item 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk
Management

A key objective of asset/liability management is to
manage interest rate risk associated with changing asset and liability cash
flows and market interest rate movements. Interest rate risk occurs when
interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities do not re-price simultaneously
either in timing, volume or both. Our ALCO provides oversight to our interest
rate risk management process and recommends policy guidelines regarding
exposure to interest rates for approval by our Board of Directors. Adherence to
these policies is monitored on an ongoing basis, and decisions related to the
management of interest rate exposure are made when appropriate.

We manage interest rate risk principally through
strategies involving our investment securities portfolio. Our policies permit
the use of off-balance sheet derivative instruments in managing interest rate
risk. Derivative instruments that we use as a part of our interest risk
management strategy may include interest rate swaps, caps and floors, and
forward contracts.

We had a fair value hedge in effect at December 31,
2005. This hedge is a $50.0 million fixed-for-variable swap of our 7% junior
subordinated debentures, described in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data—Note 11. Borrowings and under Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial
Condition—7% Junior Subordinated Debentures. For 2005, we paid interest expense
of $3.5 million on the 7.0% junior subordinated debentures. However, the fair
value hedge agreement provided a benefit of $1.2 million, resulting in net
interest expense of $2.3 million for 2005.

Our monitoring activities
related to managing interest rate risk include both interest rate sensitivity
gap analysis and the use of a simulation model. While traditional gap analysis
provides a simple picture of the interest rate risk embedded in the balance
sheet, it provides only a static view of interest rate sensitivity at a
specific point in time and does not measure the potential volatility in
forecasted results relating to changes in market interest rates over time.
Accordingly, we combine the use of gap analysis with use of a simulation model
that provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity.

Interest Rate
Sensitivity Analysis

The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the
difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-sensitive
liabilities that are anticipated to re-price within a specific time period. A
gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets
exceeds the amount of interest-sensitive liabilities re-pricing within that
same time period. Positive cumulative gaps in early time periods suggest that
earnings will increase when interest rates rise. Negative cumulative gaps
suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates fall. The gap analysis
as of December 31, 2005 indicates that the cumulative one-year gap as a
percentage of interest-earning assets was a positive 36.2%.


The
following table illustrates our interest rate sensitivity gap positions at December 31,
2005:

(1)

Includes interest-bearing deposits in
other financial institutions of $34.7 million as of December 31, 2005.

(2)

Principal cash flows are based on
estimated principal payments as of December 31, 2005.

(3)

Maturity/repricing columns for fixed rate loans are
based upon the amount and timing of related principal payments as of December 31,
2005.


Market Value of
Portfolio Equity (MVPE)

One application of the aforementioned simulation model
involves measurement of the impact of market interest rate changes on the net
present value of estimated cash flows from our assets, liabilities, and
off-balance sheet items, defined as our market value of portfolio equity
(MVPE).

The
following table presents our MVPE exposure at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
related to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market
interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points, respectively.

The preceding table indicates that at December 31,
2005, in the event of an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in
market interest rates, our MVPE would be expected to increase or decrease
accordingly.

The market value calculations supporting the results
in the preceding table are based on the present value of estimated cash flows
using both market interest rates provided by independent broker/dealers and
other publicly available sources that we deem reliable. These calculations do
not contemplate any changes that we could make to reduce our MVPE exposure in
response to a change in market interest rates.

As with any method of measuring interest rate risk,
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the
preceding table. For example, although certain of our assets and liabilities
may have similar maturity or re-pricing profiles, they may react to changes in
market interest rates with different magnitudes. Also, actual prepayment rates
on loans and investments could vary substantially from the assumptions utilized
in the model to derive the results as presented in the preceding table. Further,
a change in the shape of the forward yield curve could result in different MVPE
estimations from those presented herein. Accordingly, the results in the
preceding table should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in
the event of changing market interest rates. Additionally, the resulting MVPE
estimates are not intended to represent, and should not be construed to
represent the underlying value.

Our MVPE exposure at December 31, 2005, increased
slightly from December 31, 2004, primarily due to changes in the
investment portfolio while staying well within our policy guidelines. In
addition, our net interest income at risk remains well within policy limits.
These estimates are highly assumption dependent and will change regularly as
our asset-liability structure changes and as different interest rate
environments evolve. We expect to continue to manage our interest rate risk
actively utilizing on and off-balance sheet strategies as appropriate.


The simulation model also gives us the ability to
simulate our net interest income using an interest rate forecast (simple
simulation). In order to measure the sensitivity of our forecasted net interest
income to changing interest rates utilizing the simple simulation methodology,
both a rising and falling interest rate scenario are projected and compared to
a base market interest rate forecast derived from the current yield curve. For
the rising and falling interest rate scenarios, the base market interest rate
forecast is increased or decreased, as applicable, by 200 basis points in
12 equal increments over a one-year period.

We perform net interest income and net income
simulations in an interest rate environment whereby we shock the base rate
immediately both up and down 300 basis points in 100 basis point
increments. The combination of the ramp and shock scenarios provides us with
additional information with respect to our sensitivity to interest rates and
the impact on our net income under varied interest rate scenarios.

Our policy guidelines provide that the difference
between a base market interest rate forecast scenario over the succeeding
one-year period compared with the aforementioned rising and falling interest
rate scenarios over the same time period should not result in net interest
income degradation exceeding 25.0%. Simulations as of December 31, 2005,
indicated that we were well within these policy guidelines.

Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk
impacting us. Other types of market risk affecting us in the normal course of
our business activities include foreign currency exchange risk, equity price
risk, and basis risk. The impact resulting from these market risks is not
considered significant, and no separate quantitative information concerning
market rate and price exposure is presented herein.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

SVB Financial Group (formerly known as Silicon Valley Bancshares):

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting (Item 9A(b)), that SVB Financial Group (formerly known as
Silicon Valley Bancshares) and subsidiaries (the Company) did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, because of the effect of the material weaknesses identified in
management’s assessment, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness
is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results
in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management
identified and included in its assessment the following material weaknesses as
of December 31, 2005:

·

The Company did not have adequately designed
internal controls in its financial reporting process related to the selection
and application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Specifically, accounting policies, procedures and practices were not
consistently developed,


maintained or updated in a
manner ensuring that financial statements were prepared in accordance with
GAAP. Also, policies and procedures were not designed to consistently ensure
the preparation and retention of adequate documentation to support key
judgments made in connection with the selection and application of significant
accounting policies within the Company’s financial reporting process. Finally,
the Company’s policies and procedures did not consistently provide for
effective analysis, implementation, and documentation of new accounting
pronouncements.

·

The
Company did not maintain sufficient levels of appropriately qualified and
trained personnel in its financial reporting processes. As a result, the
Company did not establish internal control over financial reporting policies
and procedures related to (a) the timely preparation of comprehensive
documentation supporting management’s analysis of the appropriate accounting
treatment for warrant derivative assets or other non-routine or complex
transactions, and (b) the review of such documentation by qualified internal
staff, assisted by external advisors as deemed necessary, to determine its
completeness and the propriety of the Company’s conclusions.

These material
weaknesses resulted in the restatement, in December 2005, of the previously
issued consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2004, and the interim consolidated financial information for each of the
quarterly periods in 2004 and 2003 and the quarterly period ended March 31,
2005. Specifically, these material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, resulted in the following accounting
errors:

1)

Derivative equity warrant assets with
net share settlement provisions were not reported as derivatives in accordance
with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

, as amended. Specifically, the Company failed to properly
reflect the fair value of equity warrant assets with net settlement terms
received during lending activity in its consolidated balance sheet, the change
in fair value of the equity warrant assets in the income statement and the
accretion of the grant date fair value of equity warrant assets to interest
income as a yield adjustment.

2)

Initial non-refundable corporate
finance fees were not reported in accordance with the provisions of Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

.
Specifically, the Company failed to defer recognition of initial upfront
non-refundable retainers received upon execution of engagement letters to
provide mergers and acquisitions advisory services until the completion of all
contractual obligations pursuant to the terms of the engagement letters or upon
receipt or notification of an engagement termination letter.

3)

Non-refundable loan fees and costs
associated with the Company’s lending products and fees associated with letters
of credit were not reported in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 91,

Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs
Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of
Leases

. Specifically, the Company failed to recognize net fee
revenue in accordance with the appropriate straight-line or interest method, as
prescribed by SFAS No. 91, for net loan fee income obtained in connection
with the extension of lending products. In addition, the Company
inappropriately recognized non-refundable loan fees it receives for factoring
loans immediately rather than deferring and amortizing fees over the term of
the facility granted. The Company did not properly defer direct loan
origination costs associated with originating certain loan products. In
addition, the Company misclassified fees on certain letters of credit as
interest income rather than non-interest income on commitments where the
probability of exercise was deemed remote.

4)

Certain investment securities that
were readily convertible to known amounts of cash and present insignificant
risk of changes in value with original or purchased maturity dates of 90 days
or less, were not reported as cash equivalents in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 95,


Statement
of Cash Flows

. This misapplication of GAAP resulted in a
reclassification in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets of money market
mutual fund investments and commercial paper investments from investment
securities to federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to
resell and other short-term investment securities.

5)

Current federal income taxes
receivable and current federal income tax payable were not reflected net on the
Company’s balance sheets. This misapplication of GAAP resulted in a change to
the Company’s other assets and other liabilities. Current federal income taxes
receivable and current federal income taxes payable should be netted as the
Company has the legal right of offset, as defined by FIN No. 39,

Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2005. The aforementioned material weaknesses were
considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied
in our audit of the 2005 consolidated financial statements, and this report
does not affect our report dated March 24, 2006, which expressed an unqualified
opinion on these consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion,
management’s assessment that the Company did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also,
in our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described
above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company
did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

SVB Financial Group (formerly known as Silicon Valley Bancshares):

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of SVB Financial Group (formerly known as Silicon Valley Bancshares) and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’
equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2005. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO), and our report dated March 24, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion
on management’s assessment of, and an adverse opinion on the effective
operation of, internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005.

1.   Nature of Business

Nature of Business

SVB Financial Group (formerly known as Silicon Valley
Bancshares and individually referred to herein as “SVB Financial”) and its
subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company” or “SVB Financial Group”)
offer clients financial products and services through five strategic business
groups:  Commercial Banking, SVB
Capital,  SVB Alliant, Global Financial
Services and Private Client Services. (see Note 22. Segment Reporting).

SVB Financial is a bank holding company and a
financial holding company whose principal subsidiary is Silicon Valley Bank
(the “Bank”), a California-chartered bank, founded in 1983, and headquartered
in Santa Clara, California. The Bank serves more than 11,000 clients across the
country, through its 27 regional offices in the United States and three
subsidiaries outside the United States. The Bank has 13 offices throughout
California and operates regional offices across the country in Arizona,
Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North
Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. The three
international offices are located in Bangalore, India; Shanghai, China; and
London, England.

Through our Commercial Banking group, which includes
Silicon Valley Bank and its subsidiaries, we serve clients in all stages of
maturity ranging from emerging-growth companies to established, private and
public companies in the technology, life, and premium wine industries, as well
as some venture capital and private equity clients. We define “emerging-growth”
clients as companies in the start-up or early stages of their lifecycle; these
companies tend to be privately held and backed by venture capital; they
generally have few employees, are primarily engaged in research and
development, have brought relatively few products or services to market, and
have no or little revenue. By contrast, we define “established” and “corporate
technology” clients as companies that tend to be more mature; these companies
may be publicly traded, and more established in the markets in which they
participate. In 2006, we began using “SVB Silicon Valley Bank” to refer to our
Commercial banking activities.

SVB Capital focuses on the business needs of our
venture capital and private equity clients, establishing and maintaining
relationships with those firms domestically and internationally. Through this
segment, we provide banking services and financial solutions, including
traditional deposit and checking accounts, loans, letters of credit, and cash
management services. SVB Capital also makes investments in venture capital and
other private equity firms and in companies in the niches we serve. The group
manages four venture funds. We also invest in several limited partnerships,
including Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners 03, LP, and its parallel funds,
which provide secured debt to emerging-growth clients in their earliest stages;
and Partners for Growth, LP, a special situation debt fund that provides
secured debt to higher-risk, emerging-growth clients in their later stages.

SVB Alliant, our investment banking subsidiary,
provides merger and acquisition advisory services (“M&A”), private
placement advisory services through our Private Capital Group, strategic
alliance services, and specialized financial studies such as valuations and
fairness opinions. SVB Alliant is a broker-dealer registered with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and a member of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD”). In 2005, we established
SVB Alliant Europe Limited, a subsidiary based in London, England, that will
provide investment advisory services to companies in Europe when the subsidiary
becomes licensed to do so by the Financial Services Authority in England.

including consulting and business services, referrals, and knowledge sharing,
as well as identifying business opportunities for SVB Financial Group. Our
Global Financial Services group also provides banking services to international
venture capital and private equity firms.

Our Private Client
Services and Other group is principally comprised of our Private Client
Services group and other business services units. Private Client Services
(formerly Private Banking) provides a wide range of credit services to
high-net-worth individuals using both long-term secured and short-term
unsecured lines of credit. The Private Client Services group helps our clients

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Estimates may change as new information is obtained. Material
estimates that are particularly susceptible to possible change in the near term
relate to the valuation of non-marketable securities, the adequacy of the
allowance for loan and lease losses, valuation of equity warrant asset
derivatives, valuation of goodwill and the adequacy of the allowance for
unfunded commitments.

Principles of Consolidation and Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of SVB Financial Group and its majority-owned subsidiaries that are
not considered variable interest entities (VIEs) and all VIEs for which we are
the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. The effects of eliminations of revenues and expenses due
to intercompany transactions between majority-owned subsidiaries and
consolidated VIEs are not attributed to noncontrolling interests in the VIEs.

If we own at least 20%, but less than 50% voting
interest and has the ability to exert significant influence over the financial
operations and policies of an affiliate corporation, we account for the
investment using the equity method. If we own less than 20% voting interest of
a company and do not extend significant influence over the financial operations
and policies of the company, we carry the investment at cost less other than a
temporary impairment , except marketable equity securities classified as
available-for-sale securities, which we carry at fair value with changes in
fair value included in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.

If we own more than 5%,
but less than 50%, in a limited partnership, we generally account for the
investment using the equity method. If we own less than 5% in a limited
partnership, we carry the


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

investment
at cost less other than a temporary impairment. Assets accounted for under the
equity and cost method are included in investment securities.

Variable Interest
Entities—Adoption of FIN 46R

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46) and, in December 2003, issued Revised
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN
46R), which replaced FIN 46. This set forth the rules of consolidation for
a certain type of entity, a VIE, used to conduct activities or hold assets that
either (1) has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal
activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) has a
group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its
activities, or (3) has a group of equity owners that do not have the
obligation to absorb the majority of the expected losses or the right to
receive the majority of expected returns generated by its operations. An
enterprise’s variable interest arises from contractual, ownership or other
monetary interests in the entity, which change with fluctuations in the entity’s
net asset value.

FIN 46R requires a VIE to be consolidated if a party
with an ownership, contractual or other financial interest in the VIE (a
variable interest holder) is obligated to absorb a majority of the expected
losses from the VIE’s activities, is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE’s
residual returns (if no party absorbs a majority of the VIE’s expected losses),
or both. A variable interest holder that consolidates the VIE is called the
primary beneficiary. Upon consolidation, the primary beneficiary generally must
initially record all of the VIE’s assets, liabilities and noncontrolling
interests at fair value and subsequently account for the VIE as if it were
consolidated based on majority voting interest. FIN 46R also requires
disclosures about VIEs that the variable interest holder is not required to
consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest.

FIN 46R was effective immediately for VIEs created
after January 31, 2003. The provisions of FIN 46R, as revised, were
adopted as of December 31, 2003, for our interests in all VIEs. We
evaluated various entities in which it held an interest to determine if these
entities met the definition of a variable interest entity (VIE), and whether we
were the primary beneficiary and should consolidate the entity based on the
variable interests it held. The following provides a summary of the VIEs in
which we have a significant variable interest, and discusses the accounting
changes that resulted from the adoption of FIN 46R.

We have a significant variable limited partnership
interest in the Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners 03, LLC (GHLLC), which is
the general partner of Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP, a venture debt fund,
and certain affiliated funds (the “Gold Hill Funds”). GHLLC was formed in 2000 and
was consolidated as a wholly-owned subsidiary until it admitted additional
members in the third quarter of 2004, which caused GHLLC to meet the FIN 46R
definition of a VIE, since we have disproportionately few voting rights and
substantially all of GHLLC’s activities involve or are conducted on our behalf.
Because we are the primary beneficiary of the entity, we continued to
consolidate GHLLC, subsequent to the admission of additional members, as a VIE
under FIN 46R which requires that the elimination of intercompany balances and
transactions be attributed to the primary beneficiary (and not to
noncontrolling interests) in the consolidated financial statements. Creditors
of the entity do not have recourse against us, and our exposure to loss as a
result of involvement with GHLLC at December 31, 2005 was limited to
approximately $5.3 million of net equity investment in the entity and
approximately $4.1 million of commitments for future investments. None of the
Gold Hill Funds meets the FIN 46R definition of a VIE.

SVB Financial owns 100% of
the common stock of SVB Capital II, an entity formed in October 2003 to
issue trust preferred securities. SVB Financial has provided a full and
unconditional guarantee of the


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

trust
preferred securities, and SVB Capital II has no operating history or
independent operations and is not engaged in and does not propose to engage in
any other activity. SVB Capital II meets the FIN 46R definition of a VIE, but
we are not the primary beneficiary in this entity because, as a result of our
investment being funded by SVB Capital II, the investment is not considered to
be at risk. As such, SVB Capital II was not consolidated into our financial
statements at December 31, 2005, or December 31, 2004. The junior
subordinated debentures held by SVB Financial Group ($48.2 million at December 31,
2005) is included in our borrowings. See Note 11. Borrowings. We are not
exposed to loss related to SVB Capital II. The Federal Reserve Board announced
in July 2003 that qualifying trust preferred securities will continue to
be treated as Tier 1 capital until notice is given to the contrary.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand,
cash balances due from banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under
agreement to resell and other short-term investment securities. For purposes of
the consolidated statements of cash flows, we consider cash equivalents to be
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash
with original maturity or purchased maturity dates of 90 days or less.

Federal funds sold, securities purchased under
agreement to resell and other short-term investments as reported in the
consolidated balance sheet include interest-bearing deposits in other financial
institutions of $34.7 million and $11.4 million at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

Reverse repurchase
agreements are collateralized by government and government agency securities,
mortgage-backed securities rated single A or better, and A1 rated commercial paper.
Company policy allows segregated customer safekeeping of assets due to the
overnight tenor of the aforementioned transactions and we regularly monitor the
suitability and market value of collateral underlying the transactions.

Investment Securities

Fixed Income
Securities

Fixed income investment securities are classified as
held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, trading, or non-marketable upon purchase
or acquisition.

Securities purchased with the ability and positive
intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and
are accounted for at historical cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums
or the accretion of discounts to maturity, where appropriate.  Unrealized losses on held-to-maturity
securities become realized and are charged against earnings when it is
determined that an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. We did
not have any investments in the held-to-maturity portfolio at December 31,
2005 or 2004.

Securities acquired and held principally for the
purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading and are accounted
for at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from fair value
adjustments on trading securities, as well as gains and losses realized upon
the sale of investment securities, are included in noninterest income. We did
not have a trading portfolio at December 31, 2005 or 2004.

Securities not classified as trading or held to
maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are accounted for at fair
value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net
of applicable


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

taxes, are reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of
stockholders’ equity, until realized.

We consider a
number of factors in determining other-than-temporary impairment. An initial
indicator of impairment for both marketable equity and debt securities is a
sustained decline in market price below the amount recorded for that investment.
We also consider the following factors:

·

The
length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost;

·

The
reasons for the decline in market price, whether industry-wide or
issuer-specific;

·

Changes
in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the issuer’s
industry;

·

Changes
in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the issuer’s
industry;

·

The
issuer’s financial condition, capital strength and near-term prospects, as well
as its ability to make timely future payments;

·

Any
changes in agencies’ ratings and any potential actions; and

·

Our
investment horizon.

Market valuations represent the current fair value of
a security at a specified point in time and do not represent the risk of
repayment of the principal due to our ability to hold the security to maturity.
Gains and losses on securities are only realized upon the sale of the security
prior to maturity, whereas a credit downgrade represents an increased level of
risk of other-than-temporary impairment, and will only be
recognized if we assess the downgrade to challenge the issuer’s ability to
service the debt and to repay the principal at contractual maturity.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 91 “Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs
Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of
Leases”, (SFAS No. 91) we use actual principal prepayment experience to
calculate the constant effective yield necessary to apply the interest method
in the amortization of purchase discounts or premiums on mortgage-backed securities.
Estimates of future principal prepayments, provided by third-party market-data
vendors, are used in addition to actual principal prepayment experience to
calculate the constant effective yield necessary to apply the interest method
in the amortization of purchase discounts or premiums on collateralized
mortgage obligations.

Amortization of premiums
and accretion of discounts on all other debt securities are included in
interest income over the contractual terms of the underlying investment securities
replicating the effective interest method.

Non-Marketable
Equity Securities

Our accounting for
investments in non-marketable equity securities depends on several factors,
including its level of ownership/control and the legal structure of its subsidiary
making the investment. As further described below, we base our accounting for
such securities on: (i) investment company fair value accounting, (ii) equity
method accounting, or (iii) cost method accounting.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

(3)

The general partner of
Partners for Growth, LP Partners for Growth, LLC, is not owned or controlled by
SVB Financial Group. The limited partners of this fund have substantive
kick-out rights by which the general partner may be removed without cause by simple
majority vote of the limited partners. SVB Financial has an ownership interest
of 50.01% in Partners for Growth, LP. Accordingly, the fund is consolidated and
any gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the
investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in our consolidated net
income.

Under investment company
accounting, investments are carried at estimated fair value based on financial
information obtained from the funds’ respective general partner. We utilize the
most recent available financial information available from the investee general
partner, usually September 30, for our December 31 consolidated
financial statements adjusted for any contributions paid or distributions
received from the investment during the fourth quarter. The valuations
generally remain at cost until such time that there is significant evidence of
a change in value based upon consideration of the relevant market conditions,
offering prices, operating results, financial conditions, exit strategies, and
other pertinent information. Thus, any gains or losses resulting from changes
in the estimated fair value of the investments are recorded as investment gains
or losses in our consolidated net income. The portion of any investment gains
or losses attributable to the limited partners is reflected as minority
interest in net income (loss) of consolidated affiliates and adjusts SVB
Financial Group’s investment returns to reflect its percentage ownership.

Equity Method

Our equity method non-marketable equity securities
consist of an investment in a venture debt fund and several qualified
affordable housing tax credit funds.

The venture debt fund investment is in Gold Hill
Venture Lending 03, LP, which provides financing to privately-held companies in
the form of loans and equity investments. SVB Financial Group has direct and
indirect interest totaling 9.3% in Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP. Our total
interest in Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, LP exceeds the 3%-5% ownership
interest threshold established by EITF Topic D-46 for cost method accounting.
Accordingly, this limited partnership investment is accounted for under the
equity method. Thus, we recognize our proportionate share of the results of
operations of this equity method investee in its results of operations, based
on the most current financial information available from the investee.

We invest in several qualified affordable housing
projects, which provide us benefits in the form of tax credits. Under EITF
94-1, “Accounting for Tax Benefits Resulting From Investments in Affordable
Housing Projects” we account for such investments under the equity method in
accordance with the provisions of the AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 78-9, “Accounting
for Investments in Real Estate Ventures.”

We review these
investments at least quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment.
Our review typically includes an analysis of facts and circumstances for each
investment, the expectations of the investment’s future cash flows and capital
needs, variability of its business and the company’s exit strategy. We reduce
our investment value when we consider declines in value to be other than
temporary. We recognize the estimated loss as a loss on investment securities,
a component of noninterest income.

Cost Method

Our cost method
non-marketable equity securities and related accounting policies are described
as follows:

·

In
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18
“

The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock

” (APB No. 18), equity securities, such as
preferred or common stock in privately-held companies in which we hold an
ownership interest of less than 20% and in which we do not have the ability to
exercise significant influence over the investees’ operating and financial
policies, are accounted for under the cost method.

·

In
accordance with the provisions of Emerging Issue Task Force (EITF) Topic D-46, “Accounting
for Limited Partnership Investments” (EITF Topic D-46), investments in limited
partnerships in which we hold an ownership interest of less than 5% and in
which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the
investees’ operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the cost
method. These non-marketable equity
securities include investments in venture capital funds.

As stated above, we record these investments at cost
and recognize as income, distributions or returns received from net accumulated
earnings of the investee since the date of acquisition. Our share of net
accumulated earnings of the investee after the date of investment are
recognized in consolidated net income only to the extent distributed by the
investee. Distributions or returns received in excess of accumulated earnings
are considered a return of investment and are recorded as reductions in the
cost basis of the investment.

We review these assets at least quarterly for possible
other than temporary impairment. Our review typically includes an analysis of
facts and circumstances of each investment, the expectations of the investment’s
future cash flows and capital needs, variability of its business and the
company’s exit strategy. We reduce the investment value when we consider
declines in value to be other than temporary. We recognize the estimated loss
as a loss on investment securities, a component of noninterest income.

Gains or losses on cost
method investment securities that result from a portfolio company being
acquired by a publicly traded company are marked to market when the acquisition
occurs. The resulting gains or losses are recognized into consolidated net
income on that date in accordance with EITF No. 91-5, “Nonmonetary
Exchange of Cost-Method Investments”. Further fluctuations in the market
value of these equity securities, which are classified as available for sale
securities, are excluded from consolidated net income and are reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, (OCI), a
component of stockholders’ equity. Upon the sale of these equity securities to
a third party, gains and losses, which are measured from the acquisition value,
are recognized in our consolidated net income.

Loans

Loans are reported at the
principal amount outstanding, net of unearned loan fees. Unearned loan fees
reflect residual unamortized deferred loan origination and commitment fees net
of residual unamortized deferred loan origination costs. In addition to cash
loan fees, we often obtain equity warrants to purchase a position in a client
company’s stock in consideration for providing credit facilities. The grant
date fair values of these equity warrant assets are deemed to be loan fees and
are required to be deferred as unearned income and recognized as an adjustment
of loan yield through loan interest income as prescribed by SFAS No. 91.
The net amount of unearned loan fees is amortized into loan interest income


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

over the
contractual terms of the underlying loans and commitments using the constant
effective yield method, adjusted for actual loan prepayment experience, or the
straight-line method, as applicable.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

The allowance for loan and lease losses is established
through a provision for loan losses charged to expense to provide for credit
risk. Our allowance for loan and lease losses is established for estimated loan
losses that are probable but not yet realized. The process of estimating loan
losses is imprecise. We apply the following evaluation process to our loan
portfolio to estimate the required allowance for loan and lease losses:

We maintain a systematic process for the evaluation of
individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses. On a
quarterly basis, each loan in our portfolio is assigned a credit risk rating
and client niche. Credit risk-ratings are assigned on a scale of 1 to 10, with
1 representing loans with a low risk of nonpayment, 9 representing loans with
the highest risk of nonpayment, and 10 representing loans which have been
charged-off. This credit risk-rating evaluation process includes, but is not
limited to, consideration of such factors as payment status, the financial
condition of the borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying
collateral values, potential loan concentrations, and general economic
conditions. Our policies require a committee of senior management to review, at
least quarterly, credit relationships that exceed specific dollar values. Our
review process evaluates the appropriateness of the credit risk rating and
allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses, as well as other account
management functions. The allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated
based on a formula allocation for similarly risk-rated loans and client niches
and includes an allowance for individual loans deemed to be impaired under the
provisions of SFAS No. 114, “Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan.”

Our evaluation process is
designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses.
We assess the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio by utilizing
modeling techniques. For this purpose we have developed a statistical model
based on historical loan loss migration to estimate an appropriate allowance
for outstanding loan balances. In addition, we apply a macro allocation to the
results of the aforementioned model to ascertain the total allowance for loan
and lease losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other
objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of the
allowance for loan and lease losses rely, to a great extent, on the judgment
and experience of our management.

Uncollectible Loans and Write-offs

Loans are considered for
full or partial charge-offs in the event that principal or interest is over 180
days past due, the loan lacks sufficient collateral and it is not in the
process of collection. We also consider writing off loans in the event of any
of the following circumstances: 1) the impaired loan balances are not covered
by the value of the source of repayment; 2) the loan has been identified for
charge-off by regulatory authorities; and 3) any overdrafts over 90 days.

Other Real Estate Owned

Loans secured by real
estate are transferred to Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) at the time of
foreclosure. OREO is carried on our balance sheet at the lower of the recorded
investment in the loan or the fair value of the property foreclosed upon less
estimated costs of disposal. Upon transfer of a loan to OREO, an appraisal is
obtained and any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the property
less estimated costs of disposal is charged against the allowance for loan
losses. Revenues and expenses


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

associated
with OREO, and subsequent adjustments to the fair value of the property and to
the estimated costs of disposal, are realized and reported as a component of
noninterest expense when incurred. OREO of $6.3 million is included in other
assets at December 31, 2005 and there was no OREO included in other assets
at December 31, 2004.

Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments

We record a liability for
probable and estimable losses associated with our unfunded loan commitment
being funded and subsequently being charged off. Each quarter, every unfunded
client credit commitment is allocated to a credit risk-rating category in
accordance with each client’s credit risk rating. We use the historical loan
loss factors described above to calculate the possible loan loss experience if
unfunded credit commitments are funded. Separately, we use historical trends to
calculate a probability of an unfunded credit commitment being funded. We apply
the loan funding probability factor to risk-factor adjusted unfunded
commitments by credit risk-rating to derive the allowance for unfunded loan
commitments. The allowance for unfunded credit commitments may also include
certain macro allocations as deemed appropriate by our management. We reflect
the allowance for unfunded credit commitments in other liabilities.

Nonaccrual Loans

SFAS No. 114 and SFAS No. 118, “Accounting
by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan Income Recognition and Disclosures”
require us to measure the impairment of a loan based upon the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate,
except that as a practical expedient, we may measure impairment based on the
loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan
is collateral dependent. A loan is considered impaired when, based upon
currently known information, it is deemed probable that we will be unable to
collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement.

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become
90 days past due as to principal or interest payments (unless the principal and
interest are well secured and in the process of collection); or when we have
determined, based upon currently known information, that the timely collection
of principal or interest is doubtful; or when the loans otherwise become
impaired under the provisions of SFAS No. 114.

When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the
accrued interest is reversed against interest income and the loan is accounted
for on the cash or cost recovery method thereafter until qualifying for return
to accrual status. Generally, a loan will be returned to accrual status when
all delinquent principal and interest become current in accordance with the
terms of the loan agreement and full collection of the principal and interest
appears probable.

If it is determined that
the value of an impaired loan is less than recorded investment in the loan net
of previous charge-offs and payments collected, we recognize impairment through
an allowance for loan losses as determined by a SFAS No. 114 analysis.

Standby Letters of Credit

In accordance with the
provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others” (FIN 45), we recognize a liability at the
inception of a standby letter of credit equivalent to the premium of the fee received
for such guarantee. The liability recognized at the inception of the guarantee
is equivalent


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

to the
premium or fee received. Among the types of guarantee contracts to which the
provisions of FIN 45 apply are financial standby letters of credit and
performance standby letters of credit.

Premises and Equipment

Premises
and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms
of the related leases, whichever is shorter. The maximum estimated useful lives
by asset classification are as follows:

Leasehold improvements

  years

Furniture and equipment

  years

Computer software

  years

Computer hardware

  years

Vehicles

3 years

We capitalize the costs of computer software developed
or obtained for internal use in accordance with the provisions of SOP 98-1, “Accounting
for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.” Capitalized computer software costs
consist of developed software, purchased software licenses and implementation
costs.

For property and equipment
that is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is
included in noninterest expense in consolidated net income. We had no
capitalized lease obligations at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Lease Obligation

We lease all of our properties. It is our policy to
evaluate and record leases in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 13,

“Accounting
for Leases,”

(“SFAS No.13”), Financial Accounting Standards Board
Technical Bulletin No. 88-1,

“Issues
Related to Account for Leases,”

(“FTB No.88-1”) and Financial
Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. 13-1,

Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a
Construction Period,”

(“FSP No.13-1”).

At the inception of the
lease, each property is evaluated under SFAS No. 13 to determine whether
the lease will be accounted as an operating or capital lease. We do not have
any capital leases. For leases that contain rent escalations or landlord
incentives, we record the total rent payable during the lease term, as
determined above, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and
record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight-line rent
as lease obligation in accordance with FTB No. 88-1. We follow FSP No. 13-1
and recognize rent expense for facilities still under construction or leasehold
improvement from the beginning date of the lease, even though the property
cannot yet be occupied.

Federal Funds Purchased

Federal Funds Purchased
are treated as unsecured financing transactions and are governed by our
investment policies. Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase are treated
as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at
which the securities were sold plus accrued interest.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Goodwill

Goodwill, which arises from the purchase price
exceeding the assigned value of the net assets of an acquired business,
represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being
acquired. The value of our goodwill is supported by the free cash flows from
the acquired businesses. As the goodwill carrying amount solely relates to the
acquisition of SVB Alliant, a decline in earnings as a result of a decline in
mergers and acquisitions transaction volume or a decline in the valuations of
mergers and acquisitions clients could lead to impairment which would be
recorded as an impairment of goodwill charge as a component of our consolidated
net income.

On an annual basis or as circumstances dictate, our
management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may
indicate impairment in the carrying amount. We conduct our reviews of goodwill
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, which is based
primarily on forecasted discounted cash flow analyses. The evaluation
methodology for potential impairments is inherently complex and involves
significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions. We
evaluate impairment using a two-step process. First, we compare the aggregate
fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If
the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the
carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare
the “implied” fair value, defined below, of the reporting unit’s goodwill with
its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied
fair value, then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing goodwill down to
the implied fair value.

We primarily use a discounted cash flow approach to
value the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment. These
estimates involve many assumptions, including expected results of operations,
assumed discounts rates, and assumed growth rates for the reporting units. The
discount rate used is based on standard industry practice, taking into account
the expected equity risk premium, the size of the business, and the probability
of the reporting unit achieving its financial forecasts. The implied fair value
is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the
assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the unit had been acquired in a
business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price.

Events that may indicate
goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in results of
operations of the business, economic or political climate, an adverse action or
assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, and a more
likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of.

Fee-based Services Revenue Recognition

Corporate Finance
Fee Income

Contingent fees earned for mergers and acquisitions
advisory services are recognized, in accordance with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB)
No. 104 “Revenue Recognition” (SAB No. 104), when we have fully
completed our contractual and regulatory obligations related to our client
service engagements.

We recognize initial
non-refundable retainer fees over the term of the contract if a term is
specified, otherwise, the fee is recognized at the same time as the related
contingent advisory fee, or when either we or our client terminates the
contract.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Letter of Credit
and Standby Letters of Credit Fee Income

Fees generated from
letters of credit and standby letters of credit are deferred as a component of
other liabilities and recognized in noninterest income over the commitment
period using the straight-line method as the probability of the commitment
being exercised was deemed to be remote.

Client Investment Fees

Client investment fees
earned (excluding Rule 12(b)-1 fees) as well as related expenses
from customer transactions on investment products are recorded on a
settlement-date basis, which is not materially different than trade-date basis.
Rule 12(b) 1 fees are earned and recognized over the period client
funds are invested. Transactional base fees are earned and recognized on fixed
income and equity securities when the transaction is executed on the clients’
behalf.

Other Fee Income

The following types
of fee income are recognized as earned on a monthly basis:

·

Credit
card fees

·

Deposit service charge fees

Reimbursement of Out of Pocket Expenses

We receive reimbursement
of out of pocket expenses related to lending and other products offered. The
reimbursements of these expenses are included in noninterest income.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted
for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Our federal and state income tax provisions are based upon taxes
payable for the current year as well as current year changes in deferred taxes
related to temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement
balances of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
included in the consolidated financial statements at currently enacted income
tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and
liabilities are expected to be realized. As changes in tax laws or rates are
enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision
for income taxes. We file a consolidated federal income tax return, and
consolidated, combined, or separate state income tax returns as appropriate.

Stock-Based Compensation

We have several stock-based employee compensation
plans, which are described more fully in Note 16. Employee Benefit Plans. Each
of our active stock compensation plans has been approved by our stockholders.
We have elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees” (APB No. 25), and related interpretations, to account for
our employee stock options rather than the alternative fair value accounting
allowed by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS No. 123)
as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition
and Disclosure” (SFAS No. 148). APB No. 25 provides that the
compensation


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

expense relative to our
employee stock options be measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock
option. SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 requires those
companies that continue to follow APB No. 25 to provide pro forma
disclosure of the impact of applying the fair value method of SFAS No. 123.

We account for stock issued to non-employees in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and FASB Interpretation No. 44,
“Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation” (FIN 44).

We record compensation expense for the cost of
restricted stock and restricted stock units by amortizing the grant date fair
value of such grants over their vesting period.

Compensation expense related to the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (ESPP), used in determining the pro forma net income and basic
and diluted earnings per share amounts, is calculated in accordance with the
provisions of FASB Technical Bulletin No.97-1, “Accounting under
Statement 123 for certain Employee Stock Purchase Plans with a Look-back
Option.”

If
compensation cost related to both our stock option awards to employees and
directors and to the ESPP had been determined under the fair value method
prescribed under SFAS No. 123, our net income, basic earnings per share,
and diluted earnings per share would have been the pro forma amounts shown
below for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003:

Earnings Per Share

We calculate earnings
(loss) per common share in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128,
“Earnings Per Share” (SFAS No. 128). SFAS No. 128 requires the
presentation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for
companies with potential common shares, such as warrants and stock options.
Accordingly, basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed using the
weighted-average number of common stock shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed using the weighted-average
number of common stock shares and potential common shares outstanding during
the period. Potential common shares consist of contingently convertible debt
(using the “treasury stock” method), and stock options. Common stock equivalent
shares are excluded from the computation if the effect is antidilutive. The
dilutive effect of our contingently convertible debt is included


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

in
earnings per share in accordance with the provisions of EITF 04-8 “The
Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share”
(EITF 04-8).

Segment Reporting

We are organized into five
lines of banking and financial services for management reporting: Commercial
Banking, SVB Capital, SVB Alliant, Global Financial Services and Private Client
Services and Other. These groups are strategic units that offer different
services to different clients. They are managed separately because each segment
appeals to different markets and, accordingly, requires different strategies.
The results of operating segments are based on our internal profitability
reporting process (see Note 22. Segment Reporting). As of December 31,
2005, only the Commercial Banking, SVB Capital and SVB Alliant business groups
qualified as reportable segments as required by SFAS No. 131. The Private
Client Services and Global Financial Services groups did not meet the separate
reporting thresholds for segment reporting purposes. For further information on
our reportable business segments, see Note 22. Segment Reporting.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We account for derivative instruments in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (SFAS No. 133). SFAS No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, and
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at
fair value. SFAS No. 133 was amended by SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for
Certain Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 138) and
SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 149). SFAS No. 138 and SFAS No. 149
amended and provided clarification on the accounting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149
has been applied prospectively and was effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003. SFAS No. 149 was applicable to existing
contracts and new contracts entered into after June 30, 2003, if those
contracts relate to forward purchases or sales of when-issued securities or
other securities that do not yet exist.

The accounting for changes
in fair value of a derivative depends on whether the derivative instrument is
designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the
nature of the hedging activity.

Fair Value Hedges

For derivative instruments
that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge and if the fair value
hedge is fully effective, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument would
offset the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Any
difference that does arise would be the result of hedge ineffectiveness, which
is recognized in earnings. If the derivative instrument meets the qualification
for the short-cut treatment, as defined by SFAS No. 133, the period end
gross positive fair value is recorded in other assets or gross negative fair
values are recorded in other liabilities and an offsetting amount is recorded
to the asset or liability being hedged  (see
Note 13. Derivative Financial Instruments).

Cash Flow Hedges

For derivative instruments
that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, or for foreign exchange
forward contracts that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, changes
in the fair value of the effective portion of the derivative instrument are
recognized in OCI. These amounts are reclassified


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

from OCI
and recognized in earnings when either the forecasted transaction occurs or it
becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur. The result of
any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in earnings. We have not
designated any derivatives as cash flow hedges in 2005, 2004 or 2003.

Derivatives

We define derivatives as
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as defined by
SFAS No. 133, or derivatives that have not been designated in a hedging
relationship. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for
hedge treatment or are not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized
immediately in earnings.

Warrants

We follow a 2001 interpretation of the SFAS No. 133,
as it applies to derivative equity warrants with net settlement terms in
private and public client companies. In general, derivative equity warrants
that we hold entitle us to buy a specific number of shares of stock at a
specific price over a specific time period.

Certain warrants obtained by
us include contingent provisions which set the underlying number of shares or
strike price based upon certain future events. For example, the number of
shares exercisable for some warrants is contingent upon the related lending
facility, such as the extent of utilization of the facility, including draw
frequency or amount. Or, in some cases, the underlying strike price of some
warrants may be contingent upon the share price of a subsequent future round of
equity financing of the issuer. Our warrant agreements contain net share
settlement provisions, which permit the issuing company to deliver to us, upon
our exercise of the warrant, the amount of shares with a current fair value
equal to the net gain of the warrant agreement (sometimes described as a “cashless”
exercise). Because our warrant agreements contain such net share settlement
provisions, our equity warrant assets are required to be accounted for as
derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133.

Under this
accounting treatment required by SFAS No. 133, equity warrant assets in
private and public companies which include net share settlement provisions,
held by SVB Financial Group, are recorded at fair value and are classified as
derivative assets, a component of other assets, on SVB Financial Group’s
balance sheet at the time they are obtained.

The grant
date fair values of these equity warrant assets are deemed to be loan fees and
are required to be recognized as an adjustment of loan yield through loan
interest income, as prescribed by SFAS No. 91. Similar to other loan fees,
the yield adjustment related to grant date fair value of equity warrant assets,
received directly in connection with the issuance of a credit facility, is
recognized over the life of that credit facility (see Loan above).

Any changes from the grant date fair value of
derivative equity warrant assets will be recognized as increases or decreases
to other assets on our balance sheet and as net gains or losses on derivative
investments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. If
the warrants are in the money, we may exercise these equity warrant assets for
shares, when a portfolio company completes an initial public offering on a
publicly reported market or is acquired by a publicly traded company. On the
date a warrant is exercised into equity securities, it is marked to market as a
derivative asset with the resulting change in value recognized as a gain or loss
on derivatives in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.

As of the exercise date, the basis or value in the
equity securities is reclassified from Other Assets to Investment Securities
line item on the balance sheet. The equity securities are classified as
available-for-


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

sale securities under SFAS
No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Instruments” (SFAS No. 115). In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115,
changes in fair value of securities designated as available for sale are
excluded from net income and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income
net of applicable taxes, which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

The equity warrant
asset portfolio is comprised of warrants in companies from industries served by
SVB Financial Group, as described in Note 1. Nature of Business. The fair value
of the derivative equity warrant asset portfolio is reviewed quarterly. We
value the warrants using an option pricing model approach, based on the standard
Black-Scholes pricing model utilizing the following five material assumptions:

·

Underlying
stock value was estimated based on information available, including any
information regarding subsequent rounds of funding and a review of related
customer credit files.

·

Volatility,
or the quantification of the risk associated with the warrants over time, was
based on guideline publicly traded companies or indices similar in nature to
the underlying client companies issuing the warrant. A total of ten such
indices were used. The volatility assumption for each warrant was calculated
based on the average of the annualized daily volatility of a basket of
comparable public companies over each of the fiscal quarters from January 1,
2002 to December 31, 2005.

·

Actual
data on cancellations, expirations and exercises of the warrants was utilized
as the basis for determining the expected remaining life of warrants in each
financial reporting period. Warrants may be exercised in the event of
acquisitions, mergers or initial public offerings (IPO), and cancelled due to
events such as bankruptcies, cancellations, restructuring activities or
additional financings.

·

The
risk-free interest rates were derived from the appropriate Treasury yield
curve. Risk free interest rates reflect the rates of return available on
long-term high-quality fixed-income debt instruments.  Subsequent to issuance, the risk free rate was
calculated based on a weighted average of the risk free rates that correspond
closest to the expected remaining life of the warrant.

·

Other
adjustments were estimated based on management’s judgment about the general
industry environment, combined with specific information about the issuing
company, when available.

Foreign Exchange Forwards

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with
clients involved in international trade finance activities. We also enter into
an opposite-way foreign exchange forward contract with a correspondent bank,
which mitigates the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
for each of the contracts entered into with our clients. However, settlement,
credit, and operational risks remain. We also enter into foreign exchange
forward contracts with correspondent banks to economically hedge foreign
exchange exposure risk related to certain foreign currency denominated loans.
These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are recorded at
fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of
these contracts are recognized immediately in consolidated net income under
gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net, a component of noninterest
income. Period ended gross positive fair values are recorded in other assets
and gross negative fair values are recorded in other liabilities.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Foreign Exchange
Option Contracts

We enter into foreign
currency option contracts with clients involved in international trade finance
activities, either as the purchaser or seller of foreign currency options,
depending upon the client’s need. For each of the currency option contracts
entered into with our clients, we enter into an opposite way foreign currency
option contract with a correspondent bank, which mitigates the risk of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of
these contracts are recognized immediately in consolidated net income under net
gains (losses) on derivative instruments, a component of noninterest income.
Period ended gross positive fair values are recorded in other assets and gross
negative fair values are recorded in other liabilities.

Derivative
Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
Stock

We account for
non-hedging contracts that are indexed to, and potentially settled in, a
company’s own stock in accordance with the provisions of EITF 00-19, “Accounting
for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a
Company’s Own Stock” (EITF 00-19). EITF 00-19 provides for specific
treatment of derivative financial instruments indexed to, and potentially
settled in, a company’s own stock, depending on the settlement method. The
settlement methods are:

·

Physical
settlement—the party designated in the contract as the buyer delivers the full
stated amount of cash to the seller, and the seller delivers the full stated
number of shares to the buyer

·

Net-share
settlement—the party with a loss delivers to the party with a gain, shares with
a current fair value equal to the gain

·

Net-cash
settlement—the party with a loss delivers to the party with a gain, a cash
payment equal to the gain, and no shares are exchanged.

EITF 00-19 specifies
how a derivative financial instrument indexed to, and potentially settled in, a
company’s own stock should be recorded as one of permanent equity, temporary
equity, an asset or a liability depending on the settlement method. EITF 00-19
also includes provisions governing whether a derivative embedded into a
Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own
Stock may be exempt from the provisions of SFAS No. 133.

Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both
Liabilities and Equity

We account for financial
instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity according to the
provisions of SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity” (SFAS No. 150). SFAS No. 150,
issued by the FASB in May 2003, established standards for how an issuer
classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial
instrument that is within the Statement’s scope as a liability (or an asset in
some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously classified as
equity or between the liabilities and equity sections of the statement of
financial position. SFAS No. 150 requires financial instruments issued in
the form of shares that are mandatorily redeemable (or embody an unconditional
obligation requiring the issuer to redeem them by transferring their assets at
a specified or determinable date or upon an event that is certain to occur) to
be classified as liabilities. The statement was effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and was effective
at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15,
2003. It required the reporting of the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle for financial

instruments
created before the issuance date of the Statement and still existing at the beginning
of the interim period of adoption. Restatement was not permitted.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS
No. 123(R) and SAB 107

In December of 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123,
“Share-Based Payment (Revised 2004)

”

(“SFAS 123(R)”)

.

SFAS 123(R) requires us to measure
all employee share-based compensation awards using a fair value based method,
estimate award forfeitures, and record such expense in our consolidated
statements of operations. In addition, the adoption of SFAS 123(R) will
require additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional
disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share-based payment
arrangements. Due to the issuance of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
Final Rule 74 on April 21, 2005, SFAS 123(R) is effective
beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2006. In March 2005, the
Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107
(“SAB 107”) which provided implementation and disclosure guidance related to
SFAS 123(R).

We plan to use the
modified prospective transition method and Black-Scholes-Merton model to adopt
this new standard and expect the adoption will have a material impact on the
consolidated statements of income. We anticipate that upon adoption of SFAS
123(R), we will recognize share-based compensation cost on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period of awards. For the historical impact of
share-based compensation expense, see “Stock Based Compensation” (above). We
are still in the process of determining the impact of SFAS 123(R) on
compensation expense. Uncertainties, including our future share-based
compensation strategy, stock price volatility, estimated forfeitures and
employee stock option exercise behavior, may cause the actual results to be
different from our historical expense.

SFAS No. 154

In May 2005, the FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 154, “Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20,
Accounting Changes, and FASB Statement No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes
in Interim Financial Statements” (“SFAS 154”). The Statement applies to all
voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the requirements for
accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154
requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of a
voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. SFAS 154
is also required for newly-issued pronouncements without specific transaction
guidance. SFAS 154 requires that a change in method of depreciation,
amortization, or depletion for long-lived, nonfinancial assets be accounted for
as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting
principle. APB Opinion No. 20 previously required that such a change be
reported as a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. We do not believe this pronouncement will have a
material impact on our consolidated financial results.

FSP 115-1

In November 2005, the
FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments” (“FSP 115-1”), which provides guidance on determining
when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired,
and when that impairment should be considered other-than-temporary


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

and
recognized as a loss in earnings. Specifically, the guidance clarifies that an
investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment
is deemed other-than-temporary, even if a decision to sell has not been made.
The FSP also requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not
been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. FSP 115-1 is
required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2005. We do not believe this pronouncement will have a material impact on our
consolidated financial results.

EITF 04-5

In June 2005, the
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached consensus on Issue No. 04-5,
“Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group,
Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have
Certain Rights,” which requires general partners (or managing members in the
case of limited liability companies) to consolidate their partnerships or to
provide limited partners with rights to remove the general partner or to
terminate the partnership. We are required to adopt the provisions of EITF 04-5
(i) immediately for partnerships formed or modified after June 29,
2005 and (ii) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 for partnerships formed
on or before June 29, 2005 that have not been modified. We do not expect
that EITF 04-5 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

EITF No. 05-6

In June 2005, the
EITF issued No. 05-6, “Determining the Amortization Period for
Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a
Business Combination.” (“EITF 05-6”). The pronouncement requires that
leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent
to the inception of the lease should be amortized over the lesser of the useful
life of the asset or the lease term that includes reasonably assured lease
renewals as determined on the date of the acquisition of the leasehold
improvement. This pronouncement should be applied prospectively and we will
adopt it during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We do not believe this
pronouncement will have a material impact in our financial results.

3.   Earnings Per Share

The
following is a reconciliation of basic earnings per share to diluted earnings
per share for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003:

In September 2004, the EITF reached final
consensus on EITF 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible
Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share” (EITF 04-8), that contingently
convertible securities should be treated as convertible securities and included
in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share. The potential dilutive
effect of the contingently convertible debt using the treasury stock method was
considered anti-dilutive in 2003, whereby the average price of our stock during
the periods were less than the conversion price. The potential dilutive effect
of the contingently convertible debt using the treasury stock method was
approximately 1.3 million shares and 0.4 million shares as of December 31,
2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. The assumed proceeds under the
treasury stock method were calculated by subtracting the aggregate weighted
average conversion price for the average market price of the shares related to
the contingently convertible debt.

We included the dilutive effect of the $150.0 million
zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes due June 15, 2008 in our fully
diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculation using the treasury stock method,
in accordance with the provisions of EITF No. 90-19, “Convertible
Bonds With Issuer Option to Settle in Cash Upon Conversion” (EITF 90-19)
and SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share” (SFAS No. 128). However, the
exposure draft of SFAS No. 128R, if adopted in its proposed form, will
require us to change our accounting for the calculation of EPS on our
contingently convertible debt to the “if converted” method. The “if converted”
treatment of the contingently convertible debt would have decreased EPS by
$0.18 per diluted common share, or 7.5 percent for 2005 and by $0.17 per
diluted common shares or 10.0 percent for 2004.

The Bank is required to
maintain reserves against customer deposits by keeping balances with the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in a noninterest-bearing cash account.
The average required reserve balance totaled $22.5 million in 2005 and $14.1
million in 2004. The cash balances at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
are classified in cash and cash-equivalents.

The
following table breaks out our unrealized losses on our available-for-sale
investment securities portfolio into categories of less than 12 months or 12
months or longer as of December 31, 2005:

(1)

As of December 31,
2005, we identified investments totaling $629.8 million with unrealized losses
of $19.9 million whose fair value has been less than their adjusted cost for a
period of time greater than twelve months. We had one U.S. Treasury security
totaling $9.9 million with an unrealized loss of $0.1 million which was
purchased in October 2003. We had 34 securities classified as collateralized
mortgage obligations totaling $299.8 million with unrealized losses of
$9.8 million which were originally purchased between May 2002 and November 2004.
We had 9 securities classified as mortgage-backed securities totaling $96.7
million with unrealized losses of $4.2 million which were originally purchased
between June 2003 and February 2004. We had 13 securities classified
as discount notes and bonds totaling $145.6 million with unrealized losses of
$4.5 million which were originally purchased between February 2003 and August 2004.
We had 14 securities classified as asset-backed securities totaling $77.8
million with unrealized losses of $1.2 million which were originally purchased
between October 2002 and November 2004. All investments with
unrealized losses for a period of time greater than twelve months are either
rated AAA by Moody’s and/or S&P or are issued by the US Treasury government
or a government-sponsored enterprise. Because these securities are of superior
credit quality, the unrealized losses are due solely to increases in market
interest rates and we expect to recover the impairment prior to or at maturity,
thus the Company deems these impairments to be temporary. We have the intent
and ability to hold the securities until the market value recovers. Market
valuations and impairment analysis on assets in the investment portfolio are
reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis.

Investment Securities—Remaining
Contractual Principal Maturities

The
following table provides the remaining contractual principal maturities and
fully taxable-equivalent yields on investment securities as of December 31,
2005. Interest income on certain obligations of states and political
subdivision (non-taxable investments) are presented on a fully tax-equivalent
basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. The weighted-average yield
is computed using the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities, which
are reported at fair value. Expected remaining maturities of callable U.S.
agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage
obligations may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because
borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without penalties. This
is most apparent in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations as contractual maturities are typically 15 to 30 years, whereas
expected average lives of these securities are significantly shorter and vary
based upon structure. Venture capital fund investments, other private equity
investments, other investments, and low income housing tax credit funds are
included in the table below as maturing after 10 years.

Our loan classifications for financial reporting
purposes differ from those for regulatory reporting purposes. Loans are
classified for financial reporting purposes based upon the purpose and primary
source of repayment of the loans. Loans are classified for regulatory reporting
purposes based upon the type of collateral securing the loans.

A substantial percentage of our loans are commercial
in nature, and such loans are generally made to emerging-growth or corporate
technology companies in a variety of industries. The breakdown of total loans
by industry sector is as follows:

No other industry sector
represented more than 10.0% of total gross loans at December 31, 2005 or
2004.

As of December 31, 2005, our asset-based lending
represents 12.9% of total gross loans and account receivable factoring represent
10.9% of total gross loans.

Approximately 48% and 13% of our outstanding gross
loan balances are in the states of California and Massachusetts, respectively.
There are no other states with balances greater than 10%.

The aggregate recorded investment in loans for which

respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, nonaccrual
loans represented all impaired loans. There were no commitments available for
funding to any clients with nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2005. No
individual loans were deemed to be impaired under SFAS 114 at December 31,
2005, therefore, there was no allocation of the allowance for loan and lease
losses related to impaired loans at December 31, 2005. The allocation of
the allowance for loan and lease losses related to impaired loans was $4.2
million at December 31, 2004. Average impaired loans for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $13.0 million, $15.0 million and
$15.6 million, respectively. If these loans had not been impaired, $1.0
million, $1.1 million and $1.0 million in interest income would have been
recorded during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. We recorded $1.1 million interest income for the

Goodwill

Goodwill totaled $35.6
million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. All of our goodwill at December 31,
2004, pertained to the acquisition of SVB Alliant (formerly Alliant Partners).

SVB
Alliant

During the second quarter of 2005, we conducted our
annual impairment review of SVB Alliant in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 142, based primarily on forecasted discounted cash flow analyses.
The valuation analysis of SVB Alliant indicated no further impairment beyond
that already identified and recorded.

During the second quarter of 2003, we conducted our
annual impairment review of SVB Alliant, which elicited an indication of
possible impairment. Despite an increase in revenues during the second quarter
of 2003 compared to the first quarter of 2003, SVB Alliant failed to achieve
the revenues projected by the financial model used to value SVB Alliant in
connection with its original acquisition. In response to these indications, we
engaged valuation consultants to assist us in the valuation of SVB Alliant, in
compliance with the requirements of SFAS No. 142. Based on this valuation,
we recorded an impairment charge of $17.0 million during the second quarter of
2003.

During the fourth quarter
of 2003, it became apparent that the operating results of SVB Alliant during
the second half of 2003 were substantially below the performance forecasted in
connection with the second quarter analysis, primarily due to decreased fees
associated with weak initial public offering (IPO) and mergers and acquisitions
environments. We engaged the same business-consulting firm that assisted it
with its annual impairment review during the second quarter of 2003 to assist
it in conducting a valuation of SVB Alliant, in compliance with the
requirements of SFAS No. 142. Based on this valuation, we recorded an
impairment charge of $46.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2003. The total
impairment charge for 2003 was $63.0 million.

Woodside Asset
Management, Inc.

During the third quarter
of 2004, we conducted our annual impairment review of Woodside Asset Management, Inc.,
which indicated possible impairment. Based primarily on an internal analysis of
forecasted discounted cash flows, we recorded an impairment charge for the
entire goodwill amount of $1.9 million during the third quarter of 2004.
Woodside Asset Management, Inc. failed to achieve or exceed the projected
operating results used as the basis of its valuation in connection with its
original acquisition.

The aggregate amount of
time deposit accounts individually exceeding $100,000 totaled $272.2 million

million, $1.7 million, and $3.2 million for years ended December 31, 2005,

Relates
to the acquisition of SVB Alliant (Alliant Partners) in 2001 and were payable
to the former owners, who have been employed by us. These notes were discounted
over their respective terms, based on market interest rates as of September 28,
2001.

Interest expense related
to borrowings was $6.2 million, $3.0 million, and $4.4 million for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Weighted average
interest rate associated to our borrowings outstanding for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004, and 2003 was 2.27%, 1.40%, and 3.15%, respectively.

Contingently
Convertible Debt

On May 20,
2003, we issued $150.0 million of zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes
at face value, due June 15, 2008, to qualified institutional buyers
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United
States to non-US persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The
notes are convertible into the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of
$33.6277 per share and are subordinated to all of our present and future senior
debt. Holders of the notes may convert their notes only if: (i) the price
of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of a note reaches a
specified threshold, (ii) specified corporate transactions occur, or (iii) the
trading price for the notes falls below certain thresholds. At the initial
conversion price, each $1,000 principal amount of notes will be convertible
into approximately 29.7374 shares of the Company’s common stock. This
represents 4,460,610 shares of the Company’s common stock. Upon conversion, we
will satisfy our obligations to holders by delivering, at our option, either 1)
shares of our common stock, 2) cash or 3) a combination of cash and shares of
our common stock. On August 14, 2003, we filed a shelf registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, with respect to the
resale of the notes and the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the
notes. The fair value of the convertible subordinated notes at December 31,
2005 and 2004 was $212.6 million and $205.9 million, respectively, based on
quoted market prices. We intend to settle the principal amount of $150.0
million (accreted value) in cash. Based on the terms of the notes, if, at any
time before June 15, 2007, the per share stock price on the last trading
day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter was 110% or more of the then
current conversion price, the notes would become convertible. The notes were
convertible during 2005, due to the share price exceeding 110% of the
conversion price at each fiscal quarter end during 2005. Accordingly, during
2005, our note holders held the right at their option, to convert their notes,
in whole or in part, subject to certain limitations, at the


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

conversion price of $33.6277. In 2005, holders of $0.1
million of notes elected to exercise their conversion option rights. We elected
to settle the conversions in cash. No conversions occurred prior to 2005.

Concurrent with the
issuance of the convertible notes, we entered into a convertible note hedge and
a warrant transaction with respect to our common stock, with the objective of
decreasing our exposure to potential dilution from conversion of the notes (see
Note 13. Derivative Financial Instruments—Accounting for Derivative Financial
Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock).

we issued $51.5 million in 7.0% junior subordinated debentures to a
special-purpose trust, SVB Capital II. Distributions to SVB Capital II are
cumulative and are payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 7.0% per annum of the
face value of the junior subordinated debentures. Distributions for the years
ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 were $3.5 million.
There were no distributions in 2003. The junior subordinated debentures are
mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the debentures on October 15,
2033, or to the extent that we redeem any debentures earlier. We may redeem the
debentures prior to maturity in whole or in part, at our option, at any time on
or after October 30, 2008. In addition, we may redeem the debentures, in
whole but not in part, prior to October 30, 2008, upon the occurrence of
certain events. Issuance costs of $2.2 million related to the junior
subordinated debentures were deferred and are being amortized over the period
until mandatory redemption of the debentures in October 2033. We entered
into a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement related to these junior
subordinated debentures (see Note 13. Derivative Financial Instruments). The
fair value of the 7.0% junior subordinated debentures is included in Note 19.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments. We have guaranteed the trust preferred
securities issued by SVB Capital II (see Note 12. Commitments and
Contingencies).

Available Lines of Credit

As of December 31, 2005, we had available $441.0
million in Federal funds lines of credit, $236.0 million were unused.

Commitments
and Contingencies

Operating Leases

We are
obligated under a number of noncancelable operating leases for premises and
equipment that expire at various dates, through 2014, and in most instances,
include options to renew or extend at market rates and terms. Such leases may
provide for periodic adjustments of rentals during the term of the lease based
on changes in various economic indicators. The following table presents minimum
payments under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2005:

Rent expense for premises
and equipment leased under operating leases totaled $10.7 million, $12.1
million, and $11.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004,
and 2003, respectively.

SVB Capital II Trust Preferred Securities

In October, 2003, SVB Capital II issued $50.0 million
in 7.0% trust preferred securities that SVB Financial has fully and
unconditionally guaranteed, based on its combined obligations under a guarantee
agreement, a trust agreement, an expense agreement, a junior subordinated
indenture and the debentures issued under the junior subordinated indenture.
SVB Capital II will redeem the trust preferred securities on October 15,
2033, and may redeem them earlier, subject to prior approval by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, if then required by the capital rules of
the Federal Reserve Board.

SVB Financial entered into
the guarantee agreement concurrently with the issuance of the trust preferred
securities for the benefit of the holders of the trust preferred securities.
Wilmington Trust Company acts as guarantee trustee under the guarantee
agreement for the purposes of compliance with the Trust Indenture Act, and the
guarantee is qualified as an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. The guarantee
trustee will hold the guarantee for the benefit of the holders of the trust
preferred securities.

Legal Matters

On May 24, 2001, Gateway Communications, Inc.
(Gateway) filed a lawsuit in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of Ohio (Western Division) naming the Bank as a defendant. Gateway
(the debtor in the bankruptcy case) alleges that the Bank’s actions in
connection with a loan resulted in Gateway’s bankruptcy, and seeks $20,000,000
in compensatory damages, punitive damages, interest and attorneys’ fees. On June 24,
2003, the Court dismissed four of the five counts in the complaint, including
the claim for punitive damages, leaving one breach of contract claim. We
believe that the sole remaining claim has no merit and intends to defend the
lawsuit vigorously. Thus, the Company has not


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

accrued any amount related
to potential damages from this case as they are not considered probable and
reasonably estimable. The action is scheduled for trial in July 2006.

We are unable to predict at this time the final
outcome of the above matter and the ultimate effect, if any, on our liquidity,
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Certain lawsuits and
claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed or are
pending against us or our affiliates. Based upon information available to us,
our review of such claims to date and consultation with our outside legal
counsel, management believes the liability relating to these actions, if any,
will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated
financial position, or results of operations. Where appropriate, as we
determine, reserves have been established in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting
for Contingencies.”  The outcome of
litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain,
however, and it is possible that one or more of the legal or regulatory matters
currently pending or threatened could have a material effect.

13.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

We designate a derivative as held for hedging purposes
or non-hedging when we enter into a derivative contract. The designation may
change based upon management’s reassessment or changing circumstances.
Derivative instruments that we obtain or use include interest rate swaps,
forward contracts, options and warrants. A swap agreement is a contract between
two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional
amounts, assets and/or indices. Forward settlement contracts are agreements to
buy or sell a quantity of a financial instrument, index, currency or commodity
at a predetermined future date, and rate or price. An option or warrant
contract is an agreement that conveys to the purchaser the right, but not the
obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a financial instrument (including
another derivative financial instrument), index, currency or commodity at a
predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. Option
or warrant agreements can be transacted on organized exchanges or directly
between parties. The gross positive fair values of derivative assets are
recorded as a component of the other assets line item on the balance sheets. The
gross negative fair values of derivative liabilities are recorded as a
component of the other liabilities line item on the balance sheets.

The
total notional or contractual amounts, credit risk amount and estimated net
fair value for derivatives as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 were:


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(1)

Credit risk amounts
reflect the replacement cost for those contracts in a gain position in the
event of nonperformance by all such counterparties.

(2)

The fair value of these
contracts is zero because the fair value of the option contracts written with our
clients offsets the fair value of the opposite way option contract obtained by
us from a third party financial institution.

(3)

The
notional value of equity warrant assets was calculated by aggregating the
mathematical product of each warrant’s strike price and the number of shares
under the warrant.

Fair Value Hedges

Derivative instruments
that we hold as a part of our interest rate risk management may include
interest rate swaps, caps and floors, and forward contracts. On October 30,
2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of
$50.0 million. This agreement hedges against the risk of changes in fair values
associated with the majority of our 7.0% fixed rate, junior subordinated
debentures. For information on our junior subordinated debentures, see Note 11.
Borrowings.

The terms of this fair
value hedge agreement provide for a swap of our 7.0% fixed rate payment for a
variable rate based on London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread.
Because the swap meets the criteria for the short-cut treatment, the benefit or
expense is recorded in the period incurred. This derivative agreement provided
a benefit of $1.2 million, $2.2 million and $1.4 million in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively, compared to interest expense that would have been incurred
under a 7% fixed interest rate. The swap agreement mirrors the terms of the
junior subordinated debentures and therefore is callable by the counterparty
anytime on or after October 30, 2008. We assume no ineffectiveness as the
swap agreement meets the short-cut method requirements under SFAS No. 133
as amended, for fair value hedges of debt instruments. As a result, changes in
the fair value of the swap are offset by changes in the fair value of the
junior subordinated debentures, and no net gain or loss is recognized in
earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivative agreement and the junior
subordinated debentures are primarily dependent on changes in market interest
rates.

Derivatives

We enter into various
derivative contracts primarily to provide derivative products or services to
customers. These derivatives are not linked to specific assets and liabilities
on the balance sheet or to forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge
relationship and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting. All of these
contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded on the

We enter into foreign
exchange forward contracts and non-deliverable foreign exchange forward
contracts with clients involved in international trade finance activities,
either as the purchaser or seller of foreign currency at a future date,
depending upon the clients’ need. For each of the foreign exchange forward
contracts and non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts entered into
with our clients, we enter into an opposite way foreign exchange forward
contract and non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contract with a
correspondent bank, which mitigates the risk of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates. These contracts are short-term in nature, typically
expiring within one year. We have not experienced nonperformance by
counterparties and therefore has not incurred related losses. Further, we
anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements.

We enter into foreign
exchange forward contracts with correspondent banks to economically hedge
foreign exchange exposure risk related to certain foreign currency denominated
loans. These contracts are short term in nature, typically expiring within one
year. We have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties and therefore
have not incurred related losses. Further, we anticipate performance by all
counterparties to such foreign exchange forward contracts.

We enter into foreign
currency option contracts with clients involved in international trade finance
activities, either as the purchaser or seller of foreign currency options,
depending upon the client’s need. For each of the currency option contracts
entered into with our clients, we enter into an opposite way foreign currency
option contract with a correspondent bank, which mitigates the risk of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts typically
expire in less than one year. We have not experienced nonperformance by
counterparties and therefore have not incurred related losses. Further, we
anticipate performance by all counterparties.

We obtain derivative
equity warrant assets to purchase an equity position in a client company’s
stock in consideration for providing credit facilities and less frequently for
providing other services. The purpose of obtaining warrants from client
companies is intended to increase future revenue.

The change in fair value of equity
warrant assets is
recorded in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. The
change in fair value of the equity warrant assets resulted in a net gain of
$3.3 million, $2.7 million and $8.2 million at December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Derivative Fair
Value Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in a Company’s Own Stock

Concurrent with the
issuance of the $150 million principal amount of contingently convertible
notes, (See Note 11. Borrowings), we entered into a convertible note hedge
(purchased call option) at a cost of $39.3 million and a warrant transaction
providing proceeds of $17.4 million with respect to our common stock, with the
objective of decreasing our exposure to potential dilution from conversion of
the contingently convertible notes.

At issuance under the
terms of the convertible note hedge, upon the occurrence of conversion events,
we acquired the right to purchase up to approximately 4,460,610 shares of our
common stock from the counterparty at a price of $33.6277 per common share. The
convertible note hedge agreement will expire on June 15, 2008. We have the
option to settle any amounts due under the convertible hedge either in cash or
net shares of our common stock. The cost of the convertible note hedge is
included in stockholders’ equity in accordance with the guidance in EITF 00-19.
In 2005, we exercised our right to purchase 1,903 shares under the terms of the
convertible bond hedge.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

At issuance under the
warrant agreement, the counterparty could purchase up to approximately
4,460,608 shares of our common stock at $51.34 per share, upon the occurrence
of conversion events defined above. The warrant transaction will expire on June 15,
2008. The proceeds of the warrant transaction were included in stockholders’
equity in accordance with the guidance in EITF 00-19. Due to conversion events
in 2005, the counterparty’s right to purchase our stock under warrant has been
decreased by 1,903 shares. Also see Note 3. Earnings Per Share.

On May 20, 2003, we issued $150.0 million of
zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes at face value, due June 15,
2008, (See Note 11. Borrowings). These notes include a conversion feature which
is indexed to and could potentially be settled in our stock. The conversion
option is an embedded derivative, which, pursuant to paragraphs 11(a) and
12(c) of SFAS No. 133, qualifies as an embedded derivative indexed to
our stock which would be classified in stockholders’ equity if it was a
freestanding derivative. Thus, the embedded derivative is not considered a
derivative for purposes of SFAS No. 133 and is not recorded on our
financial statements at fair value.

14.   Common
Stock Repurchases

$75.0 Million Share Repurchase Program Authorized by
the Board of Directors, Effective January 27, 2005.

On January 27, 2005,
we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an
additional $75.0 million of common stock under our stock repurchase program, in
conjunction with the $160.0 million originally approved in May 2003. The
additional $75.0 million of shares may be repurchased at any time, at our
discretion, before June 30, 2006, in the open market, through block trades
or otherwise, pursuant to applicable securities laws. Depending on market
conditions, availability of funds, and other relevant factors, the repurchase
of the additional shares may be commenced or suspended at any time prior to June 30,
2006, without any prior notice. Since May 2003, when the program was
approved by the Board of Directors, we have repurchased 6.5 million shares
totaling $203.5 million as of December 31, 2005. The approximate dollar
value of shares that may still be repurchased under this program is $31.5
million. Under this program, we repurchased in aggregate 1.7 million shares
totaling $77.7 million in 2005.

$160.0 Million Share Repurchase Program Authorized by
the Board of Directors, Effective May 7, 2003

On May 7, 2003, we
announced that our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of
up to $160.0 million. This program became effective immediately and replaced
previously announced stock repurchase programs. Under this program, we
repurchased in aggregate 0.3 million shares of common stock totaling $12.6 million
in 2004. In 2003, we repurchased in aggregate 4.5 million shares of common
stock totaling $113.2 million. On May 20, 2003, we purchased 1.3 million
shares of common stock for approximately $33.4 million in conjunction with our
convertible note offering (see Note 11. Borrowings). Additionally, during the
three months ended June 30, 2003, we entered into an accelerated stock
repurchase (ASR) agreement for 3.2 million shares at an initial price of $79.9
million. We completed our settlement obligations under this ASR agreement in
the third quarter of 2003.

We believe a valuation
allowance is not needed to reduce the deferred tax assets as it is more likely
than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through recovery of
taxes previously paid and/or future taxable income.

Benefit Plans

We have the following
employee benefit plans:  (i) equity incentive plans, (ii) Incentive

and (ix) Deferred Compensation Plan.

Equity Incentive Plans

Each of our active stock option plans has been
approved by our stockholders. The 1997 Equity Incentive Plan (the 1997 Plan),
provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and nonstatutory
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase awards,
stock bonuses, and restricted stock units (collectively Stock Awards) to
employees, directors and non employees. The 1997 Plan provides a means by which
selected employees, directors and non employees of the Company may be given an
opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock at a price not less than
100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date the option is
granted for incentive and nonstatutory stock or receive cash based on stock
appreciation. Options may vest over various periods not in excess of five years
from the date of grant and expire five to ten years from the date of grant. We,
by means of the 1997 Plan, seek to retain the services of persons who are now
employees and directors of, or non employees to, us or our affiliates; to secure
and retain the services of new employees, directors, and non employees; and


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

to provide incentives for
such persons to exert maximum efforts for our success and for the success of
our affiliates.

The
table below provides stock option information related to the 1989 Stock Option
Plan and the 1997 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and
2003:

The
following table summarizes information regarding stock options outstanding as
of December 31, 2005:

At December 31, 2005, options for 1,784,765
shares were available for future grant under the 1997 Plan.

To the extent that a stock award is made from this
reserve, in the form of stock options the 1,784,765 share reserve will be
reduced by an amount equal to the number of shares subject to that award.
Further, if shares acquired from the 1,784,765 share reserve pursuant to stock
options are forfeited, the number of shares so forfeited will return to the 1,784,765
share reserve and will again become available for issuance.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

To the extent that a stock award is made from this
reserve, in the form of a stock bonus award, restricted stock purchase
agreement or restricted stock unit, the 1,784,765 share reserve will be reduced
by an amount equal to two times the number of shares subject to that award.
Further, if shares acquired from the 1,784,765 share reserve pursuant to a
stock bonus award, restricted stock purchase agreement or restricted stock unit
are forfeited, two times the shares so forfeited will return to the 1,784,765
share reserve and will again become available for issuance.

The 1997 Plan provides for the granting of shares of
our common stock to directors, employees, and non employees. Shares granted
under this plan may be subject to certain vesting requirements and resale
restrictions (“restricted stock”). For the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004, we made restricted stock awards and granted restricted stock units
for 174,811 shares of restricted stock at a weighted-average fair value of
$45.13 per share and 156,025 shares at a weighted-average fair value of $36.81
per share, respectively. At December 31, 2005, there were 252,068 shares
of restricted stock outstanding, the vesting of these shares occurs on various
dates through the years ending December 31, 2006, 2007, and 2008.

We recognized $7.1 million, $3.6 million and $1.1
million in employee and non-employee stock-based compensation costs resulting
from the amortization of unearned compensation related to restricted stock and
other miscellaneous employee and non-employee stock awards for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

If compensation cost related to both our stock option
awards to employees and directors and to the ESPP had been determined under the
fair value method prescribed under SFAS No. 123, our net income would have
been reduced by $17.1 million, $19.8 million and $19.0 million, for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

The fair
value of the stock option grants used in determining the pro forma net income
and the basic and diluted earnings per share amounts were estimated using the
Black-Scholes single option-pricing model with the following average
assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003:

The expected term was
based on the implied term of the stock options using a lattice option-pricing
model with early exercise factors based on historic employee exercise behavior.
The expected volatility for the year ended December 31, 2005 was calculated
using a blended rate consisting of equal measures of our historic volatility
and our expected volatility over a five year term. Expected volatility for the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was calculated as the historical
volatility of our common stock using a five-year term. The expected risk-free
interest rates for all periods were based on the yields of Treasury Securities,
as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with maturities equal to
the expected terms of the employee stock options.

Incentive Compensation Plan

Incentive Compensation
Plans (ICP) are bonus programs paid based on the financial results of our
various business units. Awards are distributed based on management’s assessment
of individual employee performance. Our total contributions to the ICP were $26.6
million, $28.6 million, and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan

Direct Drive Incentive
Compensation Plan (Direct Drive) is a semiannual sales incentive program.
Payments are based on sales teams’ performance to predetermined financial
targets. Actual awards for each sales team member under Direct Drive is based
on (i) the actual results and financial performance with respect to the
gross profit targets, (ii) the sales team payout targets, and (iii) the
sales team member’s sales position and team payout allocation. We define gross
profit targets as the revenue goals for total interest income after funds
transfer pricing (“FTP”) and noninterest income. Warrant income is not included
in the gross profit targets. Additionally, sales team members may receive a
discretionary award based on management’s assessment of such member’s
contributions and performance during the applicable fiscal year, regardless of
achievement of team gross profit targets. Expense related to Direct Drive was
$6.0 million, $5.1 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

SVB Financial Group 401(k) and Employee Stock
Ownership Plan

The SVB Financial Group 401(k) (the 401(k) Plan)
and Employee Stock Ownership (ESOP) Plan (collectively referred to as the Plan)
is a combined 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan and employee stock
ownership plan in which all regular employees are eligible to participate.

Employees participating in the 401(k) Plan are
allowed to contribute up to 75% of their pre-tax compensation as defined in the
Plan, up to the maximum amount allowable under federal income tax regulations
of $14,000 and $13,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004
respectively. We match the employee’s contributions dollar-for-dollar, up to 5%
of the employee’s pre-tax compensation as defined in the Plan. Our matching
contributions vest immediately. Our matching 401(k) Plan contributions
totaled $4.5 million, $3.6 million, and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The amount of salary deferred, up to the
allowed maximum, is not subject to federal or state income taxes at the time of
deferral.

Discretionary ESOP contributions, based on our
consolidated net income, are made by us to all eligible individuals employed by
us on the last day of the fiscal year. We may elect to contribute cash, or our
common stock, in an amount not exceeding 10.0% of the employee’s eligible
compensation earned in the fiscal year. The ESOP contributions vest in equal
annual increments over five years. Forfeited balances of terminated
participants’ nonvested accounts are used first to restore previously forfeited
amounts of rehired participants’ accounts and are then used to pay
administrative expenses and to reduce future Company contributions to the Plan.
Forfeited nonvested accounts totaled $0.4 million at December 31, 2005 and
$0.8 million at December 31, 2004, respectively. During 2005, Company
contributions to the Plan were reduced by $0.3 million from forfeited nonvested
accounts, and administrative expenses totaling $0.2 million were paid from the
forfeited nonvested accounts.

Our contributions to the ESOP totaled $6.3 million,
$6.8 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2005, the ESOP owned 970,346
shares


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

of our common stock. All
shares held by the ESOP are treated as outstanding shares in both our basic and
diluted earnings per share computations. At December 31, 2005, we had not
committed any shares to the ESOP program.

We amended the Plan in
2004 and added a Profit Sharing Account, which is employee directed.
Discretionary Profit Sharing Contributions, subject to our determination  will be made to all eligible individuals who
are employed on the last day of the fiscal year.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We maintain an employee
stock purchase plan (ESPP) under which participating employees may annually
contribute up to 10% of their gross compensation to purchase shares of our
common stock at 85% of its fair market value at either the beginning or end of
each six-month offering period, whichever price is less. All employees are
eligible to participate in the ESPP. Eligible employees become Plan
participants on the first day of hire. To be eligible, an employee must, among
other requirements, be age 18 or above and complete at least one hour of
service as an employee of us or any of our affiliates. The ESPP is
non-compensatory to the employees and results in no expense to us under APB 25.
Effective January 1, 2006, we will be required to recognize compensation
expense in accordance with SFAS 123R. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements in
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. For the first
six-month offering period of 2005, 68,520 shares of our common stock were
issued at $38.08 per share, while 44,812 shares of our common stock were issued
at $39.81 per share for the second six-month offering period of 2005. At December 31,
2005, a total of 986,613 shares of our common stock were reserved for future
issuance under the ESPP.

Employee Home Ownership Plan

The Employee Home Ownership Plan (EHOP) is a benefit
plan that provides for the issuance of mortgage loans at favorable interest
rates to eligible employees. Eligible employees may apply for a fixed-rate
mortgage which is amortized over 30 years and is due and payable in either five
or seven years on their primary residence. Applicants must qualify for a loan
through the usual mortgage review and approval process, which is typical of
industry standards. The maximum loan amount cannot be greater than 80.0% of the
lesser of the purchase price or the appraised value. The interest rate on the
note is written at the then market rate for five year (5/1) or seven year (7/1)
mortgage loans as determined by us. However, provided that the applicant
continues to meet all the eligibility requirements, including employment, the
actual rate charged to the borrower shall be 2.0% below the market rate. The
loan rate shall not be less than 25 basis points over the greater of either the
five-year Treasury Note rate or the monthly Applicable Federal Rate for
medium-term loans as published by the Internal Revenue Service. The loan rate
will be fixed at the time of approval and locked for 30 days. We recognize as
compensation expense the aggregate dollar amount by which interest charged to
an employee under the EHOP is less than the market rate of interest that would
be charged for a comparable loan. Compensation expense attributable to loans
issued under the EHOP for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was
$0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively, and no compensation expense was
recognized in the year ended December 31, 2003.

behalf of certain eligible employees. The fund was initially fully capitalized
by equity contributions by employees. The funds principal purpose is to invest
in a select number of private equity funds managed primarily by SVB Financial
or its affiliates. The fund will continue until December 12, 2013, unless
terminated sooner or extended in accordance with the fund operating agreement.

In 2005, we formed SVB
Qualified Investors Fund II, LLC, which is similarly structured as QIF. The
fund will continue until April 8, 2018, unless terminated sooner or
extended in accordance with the fund operating agreement. We incurred fund
administration costs of approximately $0.2 million for both funds for the year
ended December 31, 2005. For QIF we incurred fund administration costs of
$0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $0.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003.

Deferred Compensation Plan

In October 2004, we
established the Silicon Valley Bank Deferred Compensation Plan (the DC Plan).
The DC Plan became effective on January 1, 2005. Under the DC Plan,
eligible employees may elect to defer up to 25% of their base salary and/or up
to 100% of any bonus payment to which they are entitled, for a period of twelve
consecutive months, beginning January 1 and ending December 31.
Executive officers and certain senior managers are eligible to participate in
the DC Plan, and any amounts deferred under the DC Plan will be invested and
administered by us (or such person we designate). Deferrals under the DC Plan
were $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Gains on the DC
Plan investments for the same period were $19.8 thousand.

Loan Transactions

In November 2005, the Bank extended a line of
credit in the amount of $1.0 million to Skalli Corporation (dba St. Supery
Vineyards and Winery). Michaela Rodeno, one of our directors, is the Chief
Executive Officer of St. Supery. No amount was drawn on this line of credit
during 2005. The loan expires in October 2006, with interest payable
monthly. The loan had an interest rate at the Bank’s prime rate plus 225 basis
points.

In August 2005, the Bank extended a revolving
line of credit in the aggregate amount of $20.0 million to Gold Hill Venture
Lending 03, LP, a venture debt fund (“Gold Hill”), and its affiliated funds. We
have a 9.3% effective ownership interest in Gold Hill, as well as a 90.7%
majority interest in its general partner, Gold Hill Venture Lending Partners
03, LLC. The line of credit expires in August 2006 and bears an

interest rate of prime
plus one percent. The highest aggregate balance outstanding during 2005 was
approximately $15.0 million.

In December 2004, the Bank extended a line of
credit in the amount of $1.3 million to Deer VI & Co, LLC, with which
Felda Hardymon, one of our directors, is a member with a non-voting interest.
The loan was unsecured and was fully guaranteed by Deer Management Co., LLC,
with which Mr. Hardymon is also a member with a non-voting interest.  The original line expired in September 2005,
and was extended and increased to $2.0 million in November 2005. The
increased line expires in September 2006, with interest payable quarterly.
The largest principal amount outstanding during 2005 was $1.7 million. The
interest rate for the loan was the Bank’s prime rate.

In December 2003, the Bank made a loan in the
amount of $2.0 million to National Contract Associates, Inc. The loan
matured in December 2004 but was extended for one year to December 2005,
and paid off in full in December 2005. The largest principal amount
outstanding during 2005 was $1.8 million. The loan bore an interest rate of the
Bank’s prime rate plus 200 basis points, payable monthly. The loan was
personally guaranteed by Mr. H.A. Schupf, who was one of our principal
stockholders during part of this period and whose son-in-law is an officer of
the borrower.

In August 2000, we made an interest-free loan in
the amount of $0.5 million to Marc Verissimo to assist in the purchase of
his primary residence. The loan matures in March 2006 and is unsecured.
The largest principal amount outstanding during 2005 (and the principal amount
outstanding on December 31, 2004) was $0.5 million.

During 2005, the Bank made
loans to certain companies in which certain venture funds with which some of
our directors are affiliated, are beneficial owners of ten percent or more of
the equity securities of such companies. Such loans: (a) were made in the
ordinary course of business, (b) were made on substantially the same
terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time
for comparable transactions with other persons, and (c) did not involve
more than the normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable
features.

Fund Investments

In 2000, we formed two venture investment funds: the
SVB Investor Strategic Investors Fund, L.P. (“SIF”) and the Silicon Valley
BancVentures, L.P. (“SVBV”). SIF is a $121.8 million venture fund of funds that
invests in other venture funds and SVBV is a $56.1 million direct equity
investment fund that invests in privately-held companies. Both funds are
managed by their respective general partners, which are wholly-owned
subsidiaries and hold a minority interest in the respective funds. Certain of
our directors have also invested in the funds and hold a minority interest: Messrs. Hardymon
(through his family partnership) ($0.9 million) and Porter ($0.5 million) are
limited partners of SIF, and Messrs. Hardymon (through a family limited
partnership) ($1.5 million) and Kramlich ($1.0 million) are limited partners of
SVBV. Mr. H.A. Schupf, a principal stockholder, is also a limited partner
of SVBV ($0.5 million).

In 2004, we created the SVB Investor Strategic
Investors Fund II, L.P. (“SIF II”), which closed in June 2005. SIF II is a
$175.0 million venture of funds that invests in other venture funds. SIF II is
also managed by its general partner, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary and
holds a minority interest in the fund. Certain of our directors have invested
in SIF II and hold a minority interest: Messrs. Hardymon (through his
family partnership) ($1.0 million) and Porter ($0.1 million).

In 2000, we created the SVB Qualified Investor Fund
LLC (“QIF”), a $7.6 million investment fund for employees that met certain
eligibility requirements. To be eligible to participate in QIF, an employee

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

must be of a certain grade
level and must be a “qualified investor,” as such term is defined by the SEC.
QIF was initially capitalized by commitments and contributions from certain
eligible employees including our senior management. All employee participants
are required to invest in this fund with their own money, but we manage the
fund and pay all administrative costs associated with the fund. QIF’s principal
purpose is to invest in a select number of private equity funds managed
primarily by us or our affiliates. The following individuals who were executive
officers in 2005 participated in QIF, each with individual commitment amounts
between $0.1 million and $0.5 million: Messrs. Wilcox, Becker, Hardin,
Jenkins-Stark, Kellogg, Verissimo, and Witte.

In 2005, we formed the SVB Qualified Investor Fund II,
LLC (“QIF II”), a $5.1 million investment fund for employees that met certain
eligibility requirements, similar to QIF. All employee participants are required
to invest in this fund with their own money, but we manage the fund and pay all
administrative costs associated with the fund. QIF II’s principal purpose is to
invest in a select number of private equity funds managed primarily by us or
our affiliates. The following individuals who were executive officers in 2005
participated in QIF II, each with individual commitment amounts between $0.1
million and $0.3 million:  Messrs. Wilcox,
Becker, Hardin, Jenkins-Stark, Kellogg, Verissimo, Witte and Ms. Ward
Pierce.

In 2003, Gold Hill Venture Lending 03, L.P., a venture
debt fund, and certain affiliated funds (the “Gold Hill Funds”) were created.
The total size of the Gold Hill Funds is approximately $214 million. We have a
majority interest in the general partner of the Gold Hill Funds, in addition to
being a limited partner of the Gold Hill Funds. Our combined commitment total
in the general partner and the Gold Hill Funds is $20.0 million. Certain of our
directors are also limited partners of the Gold Hill Funds and hold a minority
interest: Mr. Hardymon ($2.5 million) and Ms. Rodeno ($0.2 million).

In 2005, Partners for
Growth II, L.P., a special situation debt fund (“PFG”), was created. The total
size of PFG is approximately $43.7 million. The general partner of PFG is not
owned or controlled by us. Certain of our directors are also limited partners
in PFG and hold a minority interest: Mr. Hardymon ($1.0 million) and Ms. Rodeno
($0.3 million).

Other Transactions

In March 2005, H.A.
Schupf & Co., LLC, in which Mr. H.A. Schupf, who was one of our
principal stockholders during part of 2005, repurchased from the Company in a
block transaction a total of 400,000 shares of our common stock. The shares
were repurchased at a price of $44.20 per share for an aggregate price of $17.7
million.

Other Relationships

Mr.  Sonsini is
the chairman of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, a law firm which
serves as our outside legal counsel on various matters. Mr. Dunbar was
formerly the Global Vice Chairman of Ernst & Young, a public
accounting firm which, from time to time, provides certain tax services to us.

For the year 2005, 2004
and 2003, we paid $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in
legal fees to Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements, Guarantees, and Other Commitments

In the normal course of
business, we use financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the
financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments
to extend credit, commercial and standby letters of credit, foreign exchange
options, foreign exchange forward contracts


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

and
swaps. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk.
Credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other
parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the
terms of the contract.

Commitments to Extend Credit

A commitment to extend
credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no
violation of any condition established in the agreement. Such commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates, or other termination clauses, and
usually require a fee paid by the client upon us issuing the commitment.
Commitments which are available for funding, due to clients meeting all
collateral, compliance, and financial covenants required under loan commitment
agreements, totaled $3.5 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively. Out of these available commitment balances, the fixed-rate
commitments were $325.5 million and $257.2 million at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively. Commitments which are unavailable for funding, due to
clients not meeting all collateral, compliance, and financial covenants
required under loan commitment agreements, totaled $0.9 billion and $0.7
billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our potential
exposure to credit loss, in the event of nonperformance by the other party to
the financial instrument, is the contractual amount of the available unused
loan commitment. We use the same credit approval and monitoring process in
extending loan commitments as we do in making loans. The actual liquidity needs
or the credit risk that we have experienced have historically been lower than the
contractual amount of commitments to extend credit because a significant
portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. We evaluate each
potential borrower and the necessary collateral on an individual basis. The
type of collateral varies, but may include real property, intellectual
property, bank deposits, or business and personal assets. The potential credit
risk associated with these commitments is considered in management’s evaluation
of the adequacy of the liability for unfunded credit commitments. Additionally,
we had aggregate maximum lending limits of $472.7 million and $478.7
million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to our
accounts receivable factoring arrangements. We extend credit under accounts
receivable factoring arrangements when our clients’ sales invoices are deemed
credit worthy under existing underwriting practices.

Commercial and Standby Letters of Credits

Commercial and standby letters of credit represent
conditional commitments issued by us on behalf of a client to guarantee the
performance of the client to a third party when certain specified future events
have occurred. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily for inventory
purchases by client and are typically short-term in nature. We provide two
types of standby letter of credit: performance and financial standby letter of
credits. Performance standby letters of credit are issued to guarantee the
performance of a client to a third party when certain specified future events
have occurred. Performance standby letters of credit are primarily used to
support performance instruments such as bid bonds, performance bonds, lease
obligations, repayment of loans, and past due notices. Financial standby
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the
payment by a client to a third party (beneficiary). Financial standby letters
of credit are primarily used to support many types of domestic and
international payments. These standby letters of credit have fixed expiration
dates and generally require a fee paid by a client at the time we issue the
commitment. Fees generated from these standby letters of credit are recognized
in noninterest income over the commitment period using the straight-line
method.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit
is essentially the same as that involved with extending loan commitments to
clients, and accordingly, we use a credit evaluation process and collateral
requirements similar to those for loan commitments. Our standby letters of
credit often are cash secured by our clients. The actual liquidity needs or the
credit risk that we have experienced historically have been lower than the
contractual amount of letters of credit issued because a significant portion of
these conditional commitments expire without being drawn upon.

Obligation Under Guarantees

The
table below summarizes our standby letter of credits at December 31, 2005.
The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the amount that
could be remitted under the standby letters of credit if there were a total
default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries
under recourse provisions or from the collateral held or pledged.

At December 31, 2005, the carrying amount of the
liabilities related to financial and performance standby letters of credit was
approximately $4.0 million. At December 31, 2005, cash and investment
securities collateral available to us to reimburse losses under financial and
performance standby letters of credits was $272.2 million.

Additionally, the Bank, as
a financial provider, routinely guarantees credit cards for some of our
customers which have been provided by an unaffiliated financial institution. The
Bank has recourse against the customer for any amount it is required to pay to
a third party in the event of default under these arrangements. These
guarantees are subject to the same credit policies, underwriting standards and
approval process as loans made by the Bank. Certain of these amounts are
secured by certificates of deposit and other assets which the Bank has rights
to in the event of nonperformance by the customers. The total amount of this
guarantee was $56.3 million at December 31, 2005. It is not considered
probable that material losses would be incurred by the Bank as a result of
these arrangements.

Commitments to Invest in Venture Capital Funds

We make
commitments to venture capital fund investments, which in turn make investments
in privately held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally
made up to a ten-year period from the inception of the venture capital fund.
The timing of future cash requirements to fund such commitments is generally
dependent upon the venture capital investment cycle, the overall market
conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held
companies operate. The following table details our total capital commitments
and our unfunded commitments at December 31, 2005.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments”, requires that we disclose estimated fair values for our
financial instruments. Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth
below for our financial instruments, are made solely to comply with the
requirements of SFAS No. 107.

Fair values are based on estimates or calculations at
the transaction level using present value techniques in instances where quoted
market prices are not available. Because broadly traded markets do not exist
for many of our financial instruments, the fair value calculations attempt to
incorporate the effect of current market conditions at a specific time. Fair
valuations are management’s estimates of the values, and they are calculated
based on current pricing policies, the economic and competitive environment,
the characteristics of the financial instruments, expected losses, and other
such factors. These calculations are subjective in nature, involve
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and do not include tax
ramifications; therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision or
substantiated by comparison to independent markets, and they may not be
realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the instruments. There
may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the
underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future
cash flows, could significantly affect the results. For all of these reasons,
the aggregation of the fair value calculations presented herein does not
represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of
the Company.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The
following describes the methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair
values of financial instruments.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

This category includes
cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial
institutions, federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreement to
resell and other short term investment securities. The cash equivalents are
readily convertible to known amounts of cash and present insignificant risk of
changes in value due to original or purchased maturity dates of 90 days or less.
For these short-term financial instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable
estimate of fair value.

Investment
Securities—Marketable

For marketable investment
securities classified as available-for-sale, fair values are based on quoted
market prices provided by a known and reputable pricing service or dealer
quotes.

Investment
Securities—Non-Marketable

We record our wholly owned
non-marketable venture capital fund investments and other private equity
investments on a cost basis less any identified other than temporary
impairment. For our venture capital fund, our funds of funds, SVB Strategic
Investors Fund, LP and our venture debt funds, we record the non-marketable
venture capital fund investments and other private equity investments using
investment company fair value accounting rules (see Note 2. Significant
Accounting Policies—Marketable Equity Securities).

Loans

The fair value of fixed
and variable rate loans is estimated by discounting contractual cash flows
using discount rates that reflect our current pricing for loans and the forward
yield curve.

Derivatives

Derivatives are comprised
of derivative equity warrant assets and foreign exchange spot and forward and
foreign currency option contracts. We value foreign exchange forward and option
contracts based on equivalent contract market values. We value the equity
warrant assets using an option pricing model approach utilizing the several
material assumptions, as described in Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies—Derivative
Financial Instruments.

Deposits

The fair value of deposits
with no stated maturity, such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits,
interest-bearing checking accounts and money market accounts is equal to the
amount payable on demand at the measurement date. The fair value of time deposits
is estimated by discounting the balances using our cost of borrowings and the
forward yield curve over their remaining contractual term.

Borrowings

The fair value of
borrowings is estimated based on quoted market prices for the issues for which
there is a market. Otherwise, the fair value of borrowings is calculated by
discounting the contractual cash flows using the forward yield curve.

Interest Rate Swap

The fair value of the
interest rate swap associated with the majority of our 7.0% fixed rate, junior
subordinated debentures is calculated based on market valuations obtained from
the broker/dealer that is counterparty to the swap.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments

The fair value of unfunded commitments to extend
credit is estimated based on the average amount we would receive or pay to
execute a new agreement with identical terms, considering current interest
rates and taking into account the remaining terms of the agreement and
counterparties’ credit standing.

Letters of credit
generally expire in 90 days or less, therefore their fair value was equivalent
to the residual premium or fee received at December 31, 2005 and 2004, due
to their short-term nature. Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit
typically result in loans with a market interest rate when funded.

Limitations

The information presented herein is based on pertinent
information available to us as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Although
management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the
estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively
revalued since the most recent year end, and the estimated fair values of these
financial instruments may have changed significantly since that point in time.

The
estimated fair values of our financial instruments at December 31, 2005
and 2004 are presented below.

Regulatory Matters

The Company and the Bank are subject to various
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the Federal Reserve
Board and the California Department of Financial Institutions. The Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) required that
the federal regulatory agencies adopt regulations defining five capital tiers
for banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,
significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Failure to meet
minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly
additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have
a direct material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Quantitative measures, established by the regulators
to ensure capital adequacy, require that the Company and the Bank maintain
minimum ratios (set forth in the table below) of capital to risk-weighted
assets. There are three categories of capital under the guidelines. Tier 1
capital includes common stockholders’ equity, qualifying preferred stock and
trust preferred securities, less goodwill and certain other deductions
(including the unrealized net gains and losses, after applicable taxes, on
securities available for sale carried at fair value). Tier 2 capital includes
preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 capital, subordinated debt, the
allowance for credit losses and net unrealized gains on marketable equity
securities, subject to limitations by the guidelines. Tier 2 capital is limited
to the amount of Tier 1 capital (i.e., at least half of the total capital must
be in the form of Tier 1 capital). Tier 3 capital includes certain qualifying
unsecured subordinated debt.

On December 31, 2003, we deconsolidated our
wholly-owned trust that was formed to issue trust preferred securities and
related common securities of the Trusts. The $50.0 million of junior
subordinated debentures were reflected as long-term debt on the consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2003. The trust preferred securities
continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital under guidance issued by the Federal
Reserve Board.

Under the guidelines, capital is compared with the
relative risk related to the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the
balance sheet, a risk weighting is applied to each balance sheet asset and
off-balance sheet item, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the
counterparty. For example, claims guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of
its agencies are risk-weighted at 0% and certain real estate related loans
risk-weighted at 50%. Off-balance sheet items, such as loan commitments and
derivatives, are also applied a risk weight after calculating balance sheet
equivalent amounts. A credit conversion factor is assigned to loan commitments
based on the likelihood of the off-balance sheet item becoming an asset. For
example, certain loan commitments are converted at 50% and then risk-weighted
at 100%. Derivatives are converted to balance sheet equivalents based on
notional values, replacement costs and remaining contractual terms. (See Note
18. for further discussion of off-balance sheet items.) The capital amounts and
classification under the guidelines are also subject to qualitative judgments
by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.

Under these capital guidelines, the minimum total
risk-based capital ratio and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirements are
10.0% and 6.0%, respectively, of risk-weighted assets and certain off-balance
sheet items for a well-capitalized depository institution.

The Federal Reserve Board has also established minimum
capital leverage ratio guidelines for state member banks. The ratio is
determined using Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets. The
guidelines require a minimum of 5.0% for a well-capitalized depository
institution.

Stockholders’ Rights Plan

On October 22, 1998, our Board of Directors (the “Board”)
approved and adopted a stockholders’ rights plan (the “Rights Plan”) to, among
other things, protect our stockholders from coercive takeover tactics. On November 6,
2003, the Board approved and adopted Amendment No. 1 to the Rights Plan
agreement to increase from 10% to 15% the minimum percentage of common shares
that any person shall beneficially own to qualify as an “Acquiring Person” for
purposes of triggering the stockholders’ rights under the Rights Plan. On January 29,
2004, the Board approved and adopted an amended and restated Rights Plan (the “Amended
and Restated Rights Plan”), which supersedes and replaces in entirety the
Rights Plan, and was later amended on August 2, 2004, to change the
expiration date of the plan from January 31, 2014 to January 31,
2008.

The following summary of the Rights and the Amended
and Restated Rights Plan is a general description only and is subject to the
detailed terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Rights Plan, a copy
of which is attached as Exhibits 4.12 and 4.13 to our amended and restated
registration statement on Form 8-A/A, filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on February 27, 2004 and August 3, 2004,
respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. Each capitalized term used
but not defined below has the meaning ascribed to such term in the Amended and
Restated Rights Plan.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Under the Amended and
Restated Rights Plan, each stockholder of record on November 9, 1998
received a dividend of one right (a “Right”) for each outstanding share of
common stock of the Company. The Rights are attached to, and presently only
traded with, shares of the Company’s common stock and are not currently
exercisable. Except as specified below, upon becoming exercisable, each Right
will entitle the holder to purchase from us 1/1000th of a share of the Company’s
Series A Participating Preferred Stock at a price of $100.00 per share.

The Rights will become
exercisable and begin to trade separately from shares of the Company’s common
stock upon the earlier of:  (i) the
tenth (10th) business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of
the Board of Directors) following a public announcement that a person or group
has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
the Company’s common stock, or (ii) the close of business on the tenth (10th)
business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of
Directors) following the commencement of, or announcement of a tender offer or
exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial
ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the
Company’s common stock.

Unless the Rights are
earlier redeemed, in the event that an a person or group becomes the beneficial
owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock,
then each Right which has not theretofore been exercised (other than the Rights
beneficially owned by the acquiring person, which will thereafter be void) will
thereafter entitle the holder to receive, upon exercise, common shares having a
value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right.

Similarly, unless the
Rights are earlier redeemed, in the event that a person or group becomes the
beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s
common stock, (i) we are acquired in a merger or other business
combination transaction, or (ii) 50% or more of our consolidated assets or
earning power are sold (other than in transactions in the ordinary course of
business), then each Right which has not theretofore been exercised (other than
the Rights beneficially owned by the acquiring person, which will thereafter be
void) will thereafter entitle the holder to receive, upon exercise, shares of
common stock of the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the
exercise price of the Right. Our Board of Directors has the option any time
after a person or group becomes a 15% holder of the outstanding shares of the
Company’s common stock to exchange all or part of the Rights (other than Rights
held by the acquiring person) for shares of common stock of the Company
provided that we do not make such an exchange after the person becomes the
beneficial owner of 50% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock.

At any time on or prior to
the close of business on the earlier of (i) the fifth day following a
public announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of
15% or more of the outstanding common shares (or such later date as may be
determined by action of the Board and publicly announced) and (ii) January 31,
2008, we may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001
per Right, subject to adjustment.

Segment Reporting

We are organized into five
lines of banking and financial services for management reporting:  Commercial Banking, SVB Capital, SVB Alliant,
Global Financial Services (“GFS”), and Private Client Services (“PCS”) and
Other. These operating groups are strategic units that offer different services
to different clients. The segments are managed separately because they appeal
to different markets and, accordingly, require different strategies. The
results of operating segments are based on our internal profitability reporting
process. This process assigns each client relationship in its entirety, to a
primary operating segment. The process assigns income and expenses to the
operating segments according to the


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

customer’s
primary relationship designation. Additionally, working capital and its
associated costs are allocated to the operating segments on an economic basis,
treating each operating segment as if it were an independent entity. Unlike
financial reporting, which benefits from the comprehensive structure provided by
GAAP, the internal profitability reporting process is highly subjective, as
there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. The
management reporting process measures the performance of operating segments
based on our internal operating structure and is not necessarily comparable
with similar information for other financial services companies. Changes in the
management structure and/or the allocation process have resulted, and may in
the future result in changes in our allocation methodology as this process is
under constant refinement. In the event of such changes, results for prior
periods have been restated for comparability. Changes in an individual client’s
primary relationship designation have resulted, and may in the future result,
in certain clients’ inclusion in different segments in different periods.

As of December 31,
2005, based on the quantitative threshold for determining reportable segments
as required by SFAS No. 131, our reportable segments are:  Commercial Banking, SVB Capital, and SVB
Alliant. Private Client Services and Global Financial Services do not meet the
separate reporting thresholds as defined by SFAS No. 131 and as such, have
been aggregated in a column labeled Other Business Services for segment reporting
purposes.

Commercial Banking
provides solutions to the needs of our commercial clients in the technology,
life science, and premium wine industry niches, and some venture capital and
private equity firm clients, through our lending, cash and deposit management,
and global banking and trade products and services. Lending products and
services provide our commercial clients with loans and other credit facilities,
most often secured by the clients’ assets. Lending products and services
include traditional term loans, equipment loans, revolving lines of credit,
accounts-receivable based lines of credit, asset-based loans, real estate
loans, vineyard development loans, and financing of affordable housing
projects. We often obtain warrants to purchase an equity position in a client
company’s stock in consideration for providing credit facilities and less
frequently for the provision of certain other associated lending services.

Within the Commercial
Banking segment, the cash management services unit provides deposit account and
cash management products and services, providing our commercial clients with
short and long-term cash management solutions. Deposit account products and
services include traditional deposit and checking accounts, certificates of
deposit, and money market accounts. In connection with deposit accounts, we
also provide lockbox and merchant services that facilitate quicker depositing
of checks and other payments to clients’ accounts. Cash management products and
services include wire transfer and Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) services to
enable clients to transfer funds quickly from their deposit accounts.
Additionally, cash management products and services include collection
services, disbursement services, electronic funds transfers (including ACH
services), and online banking through SVBeConnect.

Within the Commercial
Banking segment, the international services unit provides global trade products
and services, to facilitate our clients’ global finance and business needs.
Global banking and trade products and services include foreign exchange
services that empower commercial clients to manage their foreign currency risks
through purchases and sales of currencies on the global inter-bank market. Also
included are export trade finance services and products, including a variety of
loans and credit facilities guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United
States to facilitate our clients’ international trade, as well as a variety of
letters of credit, including export import, and standby letters of credit to
enable clients to ship and receive goods globally. Additionally, included are
products and services in international cash management.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Within the Commercial Banking Segment, Silicon Valley
Bank provides investment and advisory services through its broker-dealer
subsidiary SVB Securities. These services, which enable our clients to manage
their assets better, include mutual funds, fixed income securities, and
investment reporting and monitoring.

Within the Commercial Banking segment, Silicon Valley
Bank actively manages commercial client investment portfolios through SVB Asset
Management, one of its registered investment advisor subsidiaries, by providing
our commercial clients with customized cash and investment portfolio
management.

SVB Capital focuses on the business needs of our
venture capital and private equity clients while establishing and maintaining
relationships with those firms domestically and internationally. Through this
segment, Silicon Valley Bank provides banking services and financial solutions,
including traditional deposit and checking accounts, loans, letters of credit,
and cash management services.

SVB Capital also makes investments in venture capital
and other private equity firms, and in companies in the niches we serve. The
segment also manages certain venture funds that are consolidated into our
financial statements. See Note 18. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees
and Other Commitments.

SVB Alliant provides investment banking products and
services including, merger and acquisition services, strategic alliances
services, and specialized financial studies such as valuations and fairness
opinions. In October 2003, the Company enhanced the investment banking
product set by launching a Private Capital Group that provides advisory
services for the private placement of securities.

The Other Business Services segment is principally
comprised of PCS, GFS and other business service units that are not part of the
Commercial Bank of SVB Capital segments. The PCS group provides a wide range of
credit services to high-net-worth individuals using both long-term secured and
short-term unsecured lines of credit. Those products and services include home
equity lines of credit, secured lines of credit, restricted stock purchase
loans, airplane loans, and capital call lines of credit. GFS supports venture
capital and commercial banking clients with business services through subsidiaries
in India, China and the United Kingdom. Our Global Financial Services group
also provides banking services to international venture capital and private
equity firms.

The other business services units provide various
products and services. The Other Business Services segment also reflects those
adjustments necessary to reconcile the results of operating segments based on
our internal profitability reporting process to the consolidated financial
statements prepared in conformity with GAAP.

Our primary source of revenue is from net interest
income. Accordingly, our segments are reported using net interest income. We
also evaluate performance based on noninterest income and noninterest expense,
which are presented as components of segment operating profit or loss. We do
not allocate income taxes to our segments. Additionally, our management
reporting model is predicated on average asset balances, therefore it is not
possible to provide period-end asset balances for segment reporting purposes.
We have not reached reportable levels of revenue, net income or assets outside
the United States, therefore we do not present geographic segment information.


SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Our
segment information at and for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004,
and 2003, is as follows:

(1)

For segment reporting purposes, the Company reports net
charge-offs as the provision for loan losses. Thus, the PCS, GFS and Other
segment includes $1.0 million, $12.6 million, and $9.6 million for the years
ending 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively, 
which represent the difference between net charge-offs and the provision
for loan losses.

(2)

Commercial Banking segment includes direct depreciation
and amortization of $2.0 million, $1.6 million, and $1.4 million for the years
ended 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. Due to the complexity of the Company’s
cost allocation model, it is not feasible to determine the exact amount of the
remaining depreciation and amortization expense allocated to the various
business segments.

(3)

The internal reporting model used by the Company’s
management to assess segment performance does not calculate tax expense by
segment. The Company’s consolidated effective tax rate was 39.6%. 37.8% and
24.2% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
but is not necessarily indicative of the tax rate by segment.

The Intercompany payables to Silicon
Valley Bank at December 31, 2005 and 2004 pertain to the aggregate grant
date fair values of warrants obtained by Silicon Valley Bank from July 1,
2001 through the balance sheet dates, net of payments for such. Silicon Valley
Bank often obtains derivative equity warrant assets to purchase a position in a
client company’s stock in connection with providing credit facilities and less
frequently for certain other business services. The parent purchases all equity
warrant assets from Silicon Valley Bank at grant date fair value (See Note 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Derivative Financial Instruments—Derivatives).

On January 19, 2006, the Board of Directors
increased the stock repurchase plan and authorized up to an additional $70.0
million of common stock to be repurchased. We may, at our discretion, exercise
this additional repurchase authority at any time on or before June 30,

funds, and other relevant
factors, we may begin or suspend repurchases at any time prior to the
termination of the repurchase program on June 30, 2007, without any prior
notice.

From January 1, 2006
through March 16, 2006, the Company repurchased 435,000 shares of its
common stock totalling $21.9 million under the stock repurchase program
leaving $79.7 million that still may be repurchased under the program. The
Company’s trading window closed at the close of business on March 3, 2006.
To continue the repurchase program, the Company put into effect a 10b5-1 plan
which allows the Company to automatically repurchase a predetermined number
shares per day at the market price on every trading day until the trading
window re-opens three days after the Company releases its first quarter 2006 earnings.

Controls and
Procedures

(a)

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls
and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) are recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s (SEC) rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
among other processes, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

We carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2005 pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15b. As
a result of the material weaknesses described below in Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A(b)), the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31,
2005.

(b)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting at the Company.
Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the
supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately
and fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, transactions and dispositions of our
assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the
directors of the Company, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving
financial reporting objectives. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As of December 31, 2005, we carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15(c), as
adopted by the SEC under the Exchange Act. In evaluating the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting, management used the framework
established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).


A material weakness is a control deficiency, or
combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected. Management identified the
following material weaknesses as of December 31, 2005:

We did not have adequately designed internal controls
in our financial reporting process related to the selection and application of
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Specifically, accounting
policies, procedures and practices were not consistently developed, maintained
or updated in a manner ensuring that financial statements were prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Also, policies and procedures were not designed to
consistently ensure the preparation and retention of adequate documentation to
support key judgments made in connection with the selection and application of
significant accounting policies within our financial reporting process. Finally,
our policies and procedures did not consistently provide for effective
analysis, implementation, and documentation of new accounting pronouncements.

We did not maintain sufficient levels of appropriately
qualified and trained personnel in our financial reporting processes. As a
result, we did not establish internal control over financial reporting policies
and procedures related to (a) the timely preparation of comprehensive
documentation supporting management’s analysis of the appropriate accounting
treatment for warrant derivative assets or other non-routine or complex
transactions, and (b) the review of such documentation by qualified
internal staff, assisted by external advisors as deemed necessary, to determine
its completeness and the propriety of our conclusions.

These material
weaknesses resulted in the restatement, in December 2005, of our previously
issued consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2004, and the interim consolidated financial information for each of the
quarterly periods in 2004 and 2003 and the quarterly period ended March 31,
2005. Specifically, the aforementioned material weaknesses in internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 resulted in the following
accounting errors:

(1)   Derivative
equity warrant assets with net share settlement provisions were not reported as
derivatives in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended. Specifically, we
failed to properly reflect the fair value of equity warrant assets with net
settlement terms received during lending activity in our consolidated balance
sheet, the change in fair value of the equity warrant assets in the income
statement and the accretion of the grant date fair value of equity warrant
assets to interest income as a yield adjustment

(2)   Initial
non-refundable corporate finance fees were not reported in accordance with the
provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue
Recognition

. Specifically, we failed to defer recognition of initial
upfront non-refundable retainers received upon execution of engagement letters
to provide mergers and acquisitions advisory services until the completion of
all contractual obligations pursuant to the terms of the engagement letters or
upon receipt or notification of an engagement termination letter.

(3)   Non-refundable
loan fees and costs associated with our lending products and fees associated
with letters of credit were not reported in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 91,

Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs
Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of
Leases

. Specifically, we failed to recognize net fee revenue in
accordance with the appropriate straight-line or interest method, as prescribed
by SFAS No. 91, for net loan fee income obtained in connection with the
extension of lending products. In addition, we inappropriately recognized
non-refundable loan fees that we receive for factoring loans immediately rather
than deferring and amortizing fees over the term of the facility granted. We
did not properly defer direct loan origination


costs associated with
originating certain loan products. In addition, we misclassified fees on
certain letters of credit as interest income rather than noninterest income on
commitments where the probability of exercise was deemed remote.

(4)   Certain
investment securities that were readily convertible to known amounts of cash
and present insignificant risk of changes in value with original or purchased
maturity dates of 90 days or less, were not reported as cash equivalents
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 95,

Statement of
Cash Flows

. This misapplication of GAAP resulted in a
reclassification in our consolidated balance sheets of money market mutual fund
investments and commercial paper investments from Investment securities to
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell and other
short-term investment securities.

(5)   Current
federal income taxes receivable and current federal income taxes payable were
not reflected net on our balance sheets. This misapplication of GAAP resulted
in a change to our other assets and other liabilities. Current federal income
taxes receivable and current federal income taxes payable should be netted as
we have the legal right of offset, as defined by FIN No. 39,

Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts

.

Based on our assessment and the criteria discussed
above, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, our
internal control over financial reporting was not effective as a result of the
aforementioned material weaknesses.

KPMG LLP, our independent
registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on management’s assessment
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their
attestation report which appears on page 86.

(c)

Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

Except as described below,
there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
identified in management’s evaluation during the fourth quarter of the period
covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

(d)

Remediation of Material Weaknesses

Our management has identified the steps necessary to
address the aforementioned material weaknesses, including:

Documenting of processes and procedures, along with
appropriate training, to ensure that our accounting policies, which have been
corrected to conform with U.S. GAAP, are consistently applied going forward;

Hiring additional accounting personnel to ensure that
accounting personnel with adequate experience, skills and knowledge
particularly in relation to complex or non-routine transactions are directly
involved in the review and accounting evaluation of such transactions;

Involving internal personnel assisted by external
advisors, as deemed necessary, early in the process, particularly in complex or
non-routine transactions, to obtain additional guidance as to the application
of generally accepted accounting principles to any such proposed transaction;

Ensuring comprehensive documentation supporting
management’s analysis of the appropriate accounting treatment for equity
warrant derivatives or other non-routine or complex transactions and the
related review thereof are completed to standards established by senior
accounting personnel and the principal accounting officer;


Requiring senior accounting personnel and the
principal accounting officer to review all complex or non-routine transactions
to evaluate and approve the accounting treatment for such transactions; and

Requiring regular periodic review of all significant
accounting policies and their adoptions, application, and impact by senior
accounting personnel and the principal accounting officer together with the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

We began to execute the remediation plans identified
above in the third quarter of 2005, and we believe our controls and procedures
will continue to improve as a result of the further implementation of these
actions.

We cannot assure you that
these remediation efforts will be successful or that our internal control over
financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives
all of the time. See Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk—Factors That May Affect Future Results.
