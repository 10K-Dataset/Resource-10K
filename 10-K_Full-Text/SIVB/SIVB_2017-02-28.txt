In addition, management has in the past and may in the future make forward-looking statements to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and represent only our beliefs regarding future events. Broadly speaking, forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:

Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we have based these expectations on our current beliefs as well as our assumptions, and such expectations may prove to be incorrect. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results of operations and financial performance could differ significantly from those expressed in or implied by our management’s forward-looking statements.  Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ from the expectations stated in the forward-looking statements include, among others:

•

Market and economic conditions, including the interest rate environment, and the associated impact on us;

•

The credit profile and credit quality of our loan portfolio and volatility of our levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs;

•

The adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and the need to make provisions for loan losses for any period;

Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We urge investors to consider all of these factors, among others, carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.

Business Overview

For reporting purposes, SVB Financial Group has three operating segments for which we report financial information in this report: Global Commercial Bank, SVB Private Bank and SVB Capital.

Global Commercial Bank

Our Global Commercial Bank segment is comprised of results primarily from our Commercial Bank, our Private Equity Division, SVB Wine, SVB Analytics and our Debt Fund Investments, each as further described below.

Commercial Bank

.  Our Commercial Bank products and services are provided by the Bank and its subsidiaries to commercial clients primarily in the technology, life science/healthcare, and private equity/venture capital industries. The Bank provides solutions to the financial needs of commercial clients through credit, global treasury management, foreign exchange, global trade finance, and other services. We broadly serve clients within the U.S., as well as non-U.S. clients in key international innovation markets.

Through our credit products and services, the Bank extends loans and other credit facilities to commercial clients. In particular, credit products and services include traditional term loans, equipment loans, asset-based loans, revolving lines of credit, accounts-receivable-based lines of credit, capital call lines of credit and credit cards. These loans may be secured by clients' assets or future cash flows or may be unsecured.

The Bank's global treasury management products and services include a wide range of deposits and receivables, payments, and cash management solutions accessible through our expanding online and mobile banking platforms. Deposit products include business and analysis checking accounts, money market accounts, multi-currency accounts, in-country bank accounts and sweep accounts. In connection with deposit services, the Bank provides receivables services, which include merchant services, remote capture, lockbox, electronic deposit capture, and fraud control services. Payment and cash management products and services include wire transfer and automated clearing house payment services to enable clients to transfer funds more quickly, as well as business bill pay, business credit and debit cards, account analysis, and disbursement services.

The Bank's foreign exchange and global trade products and services help to facilitate clients' global finance and business needs. These products and services include foreign exchange services that help commercial clients to manage their foreign currency needs and risks through the purchase and sale of currencies, swaps and hedges on the global inter-bank market. The



Bank also offers letters of credit, including export, import, and standby letters of credit, to enable clients to ship and receive goods globally.

The Bank and its subsidiaries also offer a variety of investment services and solutions to its clients that enable them to more effectively manage their assets. For example, through its registered investment advisory subsidiary, SVB Asset Management, the Bank offers discretionary investment advisory services based on its clients' investment policies, strategies and objectives. The Bank also offers investment solutions through our repurchase agreement program.

Private Equity Division.

Our Private Equity Division provides banking products and services primarily to our private equity and venture capital clients.

SVB Wine

.  SVB Wine provides banking products and services to our premium wine industry clients, including vineyard development loans.

SVB Analytics

.  SVB Analytics, Inc. ("SVB Analytics") provides equity valuation services to companies and private equity/venture capital firms.

Debt Fund Investments

.

SVB Private Bank

SVB Private Bank is the private banking division of the Bank, which provides a range of personal financial solutions for consumers. Our clients are primarily private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders of the innovation companies they support. We offer a customized suite of private banking services, including mortgages, home equity lines of credit, restricted stock purchase loans, capital call lines of credit, and other secured and unsecured lending products.  We also help our private banking clients meet their cash management needs by providing deposit account products and services, including checking, money market, certificates of deposit accounts, online banking, credit cards and other personalized banking services. SVB Private Bank also includes SVB Wealth Advisory, an investment advisory subsidiary of the Bank, which provides private wealth management services to individual clients.

Note 21—"Segment Reporting" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

.

Revenue Sources

Our total revenue is comprised of our net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and noninterest income for the year ended

December 31, 2016

were

$1.2 billion

and

$457 million

, respectively.

Net interest income accounts for the major portion of our earnings. It is comprised primarily of income generated from interest rate spread differences between the interest rates received on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to clients and securities held in our fixed income securities portfolio, and the interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Our deposits are largely obtained from commercial clients within our technology, life science/healthcare and private equity/venture capital industry sectors. We also obtain deposits from the premium wine industry commercial clients and from our SVB Private Bank clients. Other than our Private Bank clients, we do not obtain deposits from retail or consumer banking sources.

Noninterest income is primarily income generated from our fee-based services and gains on our investments and derivative securities. We offer a wide range of fee-based financial services to our clients, including global commercial banking, private banking and other business services. We believe our ability to integrate and cross-sell our diverse financial services to our clients is a strength of our business model. Additionally, we hold available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, non-marketable and marketable investment securities.  Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, we manage and invest in private equity/venture capital



funds that invest directly in privately-held companies, as well as funds that invest in other private equity/venture capital funds. Gains on these investments are reported in our consolidated statements of income and include noncontrolling interests.  We also recognize gains from warrants to acquire stock in client companies, which we obtain in connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other services. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Noninterest Income-Gains on Investment Securities, Net” - and "-Gains on Derivative Instruments, Net" under Part II, Item 7 of this report.

We derive substantially all of our revenue from U.S. clients.

We derived less than 10 percent of our total revenues from foreign clients for each of


,


and 2014.

Client Niches

We provide products and services to serve the needs of our clients in each of the niches described below.  We serve our commercial company clients throughout their life cycles, beginning with the emerging, start-up stage and progressing through later stages as their needs mature and expand, primarily in the technology and life science/healthcare industries.  We also serve other targeted client niches --- private equity and venture capital firms, premium wine and private banking/wealth management.

Technology and Life Science/Healthcare

We serve a variety of clients in the technology and life science/healthcare industries. Our technology clients tend to be in the industries of: hardware (such as semiconductors, communications, data, storage, and electronics); software and internet (such as infrastructure software, applications, software services, digital content and advertising technology), and energy and resource innovation ("ERI"). Because of the diverse nature of ERI products and services, ERI-related loans are reported under our hardware, software and internet, life science/healthcare and other commercial loan categories, as applicable, for loan-related reporting. Our life science/healthcare clients primarily tend to be in the industries of biotechnology, medical devices, healthcare information technology and healthcare services. A key component of our technology and life science/healthcare business strategy is to develop relationships with clients at an early stage and offer them banking services that will continue to meet their needs as they mature and expand. We serve these clients primarily through three practices:

•

Our

SVB Accelerator

practice focuses on serving our “emerging” or “early-stage” clients. These clients are generally privately-held companies in the start-up or early stages of their life cycles and funded by friends and family,

“

seed

”

or

“

angel

”

investors, or have gone through an initial round of venture capital financing. They are typically engaged primarily in research and development activities, have little or no revenue and may have brought only a few products or services to market, if any. SVB Accelerator clients tend to have annual revenues below $5 million, and many are pre-revenue companies.

•

Our

SVB Growth

practice serves our “mid-stage” and “late-stage” clients. These clients are generally privately-held companies in the intermediate or later stages of their life cycles, and are often dependent on venture capital for funding. However, some of these clients are in the more advanced stages of their life cycles and may be publicly-held or poised to become publicly-held. Our SVB Growth clients generally have a more established product or service offering in the market and may be in a period of expansion. SVB Growth clients tend to have annual revenues between $5 million and $75 million.

•

Our

SVB Corporate Finance

practice primarily serves our large corporate clients, which are more mature and established companies. These clients are generally publicly-held or large privately-held companies and have a more sophisticated product or service offering in the market. SVB Corporate Finance clients tend to have annual revenues over $75 million.

In addition, our

Sponsored Finance

group provides debt financing in support of private equity sponsored company acquisitions, primarily technology and life science/healthcare companies.

Private Equity/Venture Capital

We serve clients in the private equity/venture capital community, many of whom are investors in the portfolio company clients we bank.  In particular, we provide credit facilities to our private equity/venture capital clients, including capital call lines of credit, the repayment of which is dependent on the payment of capital calls or management fees by the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by the firms.

Since our founding, we have cultivated strong relationships within the venture capital community, which has over time expanded into the private equity community.  We believe our network helps to facilitate deal flow opportunities between these private equity/venture capital firms and the companies within the markets we serve.



Premium Wine

We are one of the leading providers of financial services to premium wine producers across the Western United States, primarily in California’s Napa Valley, Sonoma County and Central Coast regions, as well as the Pacific Northwest. We focus on vineyards and wineries that produce grapes and premium wines.

Private Bank/Wealth Management

We provide private banking and wealth management services to consumer clients, including private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders of the innovation companies we support.  We offer private banking, cash management and wealth management services in meeting their personal banking and financial needs.

Competition

The banking and financial services industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve as a result of changes in regulation, technology, product delivery systems, and the general market and economic climate. Our competitors include other banks, debt funds, specialty and diversified financial services intermediaries and other “Fintech” disruptors that offer lending, leasing, payments, investment, foreign currency exchange, advisory and other financial products and services to our target client base. For example, we compete with alternative lenders, such as “marketplace” lenders, peer-to-peer lenders and other non-traditional lenders that have emerged in recent years. We also compete with non-financial service providers, particularly payment facilitators and processors, as well as other nonbanking technology providers in the payments industry which may offer specialized services to our client base.  In addition, we compete with hedge funds and private equity funds. The principal competitive factors in our markets include product offerings, service, pricing, and transaction size and structure. Given our established market position within the client segments that we serve, our continued efforts to develop products and services, and our ability to integrate and cross-sell our diverse financial services to extend the length of our relationships with our clients, we believe we compete favorably in the markets in our core business areas.

Employees

As of

December 31, 2016

, we employed

2,311

full-time equivalent employees.

Supervision and Regulation

Our bank and bank holding company operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies.  This regulation is intended primarily for the stability of the U.S. banking system as well as the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”).  This regulation is not intended for the benefit of our security holders.  As a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status, SVB Financial Group is subject to primary inspection, supervision, regulation, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the “Federal Reserve”) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”).  The Bank, as a California state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to primary supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as the California Department of Business Oversight (the “DBO”) - Division of Financial Institutions.  In addition, and to the extent provided by law, the Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) and the DIF.  Our consumer banking activities also are subject to regulation and supervision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”).  SVB Financial Group and its other non-bank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and other applicable federal and state regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”).  In addition, we are subject to regulation by certain foreign regulatory agencies in international jurisdictions where we conduct, or may in the future wish to conduct, business, including the United Kingdom, Israel, Hong Kong and China. (See “-International Regulation” below.)

The following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete.  This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion.  Regulators, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and international consultative and standard setting bodies continue to enact rules, laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies in an effort to protect consumers and investors, and may have differing interpretations in the implementation of such rules. As a result, the precise nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on the Company’s business cannot be predicted and in some cases, may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.



Regulation of SVB Financial

Under the BHC Act, SVB Financial, as a bank holding company, is subject to the Federal Reserve’s regulation and its authority to, among other things:

•

Require periodic reports and such other additional information as the Federal Reserve may require in its discretion;

•

Require the maintenance of certain minimum levels of capital and capital adequacy standards;

•

Restrict the ability of bank holding companies to service debt, pay dividends or receive dividends or other distributions from their subsidiary banks;

•

Require prior approval for senior executive officer and director changes under certain circumstances;

•

Require that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to their banks and commit resources as necessary to support their banks.  The determination of a bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice, a violation of Federal Reserve regulations or otherwise inconsistent with applicable statutory standards, or all of the foregoing;

•

Terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary, or if there is a failure to maintain certain capital and management standards;

•

Regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem our securities in certain situations; and

•

Require approval of acquisitions and mergers with banks and large financial companies and consider certain competitive, management, financial, financial stability and other factors in granting these approvals.  Similar California and other state banking agency approvals may also be required.

Bank holding companies generally are prohibited, except in certain statutorily prescribed instances including exceptions for financial holding companies, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of 5% or more of any class of the outstanding voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or furnishing services to its subsidiaries.  However, subject to prior notice or Federal Reserve approval, bank holding companies may engage in, or acquire shares of companies engaged in, activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.  As a financial holding company, SVB Financial generally may engage in these nonbanking activities and certain other broader securities, insurance, merchant banking and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be “financial in nature” or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature without prior Federal Reserve approval, subject to the requirement imposed by the Dodd‑Frank Act (defined below) that SVB Financial must obtain prior Federal Reserve approval (subject to certain exceptions) in order to acquire a nonbanking company engaged in financial activities with more than $10 billion in consolidated assets.

Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”), in order to elect and retain financial holding company status, all depository institution subsidiaries of a bank holding company must be well-capitalized, well-managed, and, except in limited circumstances, in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”).  In addition, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act (defined below), a financial holding company, and no longer just bank subsidiaries thereof, is required to be well-capitalized and well-managed.  Failure to maintain compliance with these requirements or correct any non-compliance within a specified time could lead to divestiture of subsidiary banks, require all activities to conform to those permissible for a bank holding company (as opposed to the greater range of activities permissible for a financial holding company), or subject the financial holding company to other regulatory restrictions.

Because SVB Financial is a holding company, our rights and the rights of our creditors and security holders to participate in the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary.  In addition, there are various statutory and regulatory limitations on the extent to which the Bank can finance or otherwise transfer funds to us or to our non−bank subsidiaries, including certain investment funds to which the Bank serves as an investment adviser, whether in the form of loans or other extensions of credit, including a purchase of assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, securities investments, the borrowing or lending of securities to the extent that the transaction causes the Bank or a subsidiary to have credit exposure to the affiliate, or certain other specified types of transactions, as discussed in further detail below. Further, loans and other extensions of credit by the Bank to us or any of our non−bank subsidiaries are required to be secured by specified amounts of collateral and are required to be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

SVB Financial is also treated as a bank holding company under the California Financial Code.  As such, SVB Financial and its subsidiaries are subject to periodic examination by and may be required to file reports with the DBO.



Securities Registration and Listing

SVB Financial’s securities are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.  As such, SVB Financial is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading, corporate governance, and other requirements and restrictions of the Exchange Act, as well as the Marketplace Rules and other requirements promulgated by the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC.

As a public company, SVB Financial is also subject to the accounting oversight and corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes−Oxley Act of 2002, including, among other things, required executive certification of financial presentations, increased requirements for board audit committees and their members, and enhanced requirements relating to disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law.  The Dodd-Frank Act was intended to make significant structural reforms to the financial services industry.  The Dodd-Frank Act broadly affects the financial services industry by creating new resolution authorities, requiring ongoing stress testing of capital, mandating higher capital levels and liquidity management requirements, increasing regulation of executive and incentive-based compensation and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector.  Various aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act apply based on the asset size of the financial institution.  Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for:

•

Capital standards applicable to bank holding companies that may be no less stringent than those generally applicable to insured depository institutions;

•

Annual stress tests for financial entities, including SVB Financial and the Bank;

•

Additional risk management and other enhanced prudential standards for larger bank holding companies with $50 billion or greater in total consolidated assets (See "-Enhanced Prudential Standards" below);

•

Restrictions on a banking institution’s ability to engage in proprietary trading and to sponsor, invest in or lend to certain funds, including venture capital, hedge and private equity funds;

•

Repeal of the federal prohibition (Regulation Q) on the payment of interest on demand deposits, including business checking accounts, and establishment of the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance;

•

The establishment of the CFPB with responsibility for promulgating and enforcing regulations designed to protect consumers’ financial interests and prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices by financial institutions;

•

The authority of the CFPB to directly examine those financial institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, such as SVB Financial, for compliance with the regulations promulgated by the CFPB;

•

Limits, or the imposition of significant burdens and compliance and other costs on, certain activities previously conducted by banking organizations, such as originating and securitizing mortgage loans and other financial assets, arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions, proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds and restrictions on debit charge interchange fees; and

•

The establishment of new compensation restrictions and standards regarding the time, manner and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including documentation and governance, proxy access by stockholders, deferral and claw-back requirements.

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the issuance of numerous implementing regulations, some of which have not yet been issued. Some of the final regulations will continue to take effect over several more years, continuing to make it difficult to anticipate the overall impact to us, our customers, or the financial industry in general. Individually and collectively, both the proposed and final regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial conditions and results of operations.  Further, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes enhanced prudential standards on bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more.  See "-Enhanced Prudential Standards" below.  As we approach a total consolidated asset size of $50 billion, we may experience heightened regulatory expectations with respect to our risk management practices and other matters, even though we are not yet formally subject to such enhanced prudential standards.

Enhanced Prudential Standards

Under the Federal Reserve’s regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act’s enhanced prudential standards, bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are subject to more stringent prudential requirements, including requirements for risk-based and leverage capital, liquidity management, risk management, resolution planning, supervisory capital stress testing and capital planning, single counterparty credit exposure limits, and early remediation.  Certain requirements,



including the single counterparty credit exposure limits and early remediation standards, have not yet been finalized and implemented.

Pursuant to the Federal Reserve’s regulations, a bank holding company becomes subject to the more stringent prudential standards at the end of a four-quarter period over the course of which the bank holding company averages total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more.  We refer to the conclusion of that four-quarter period as the time at which a bank holding company becomes “subject to enhanced prudential standards.”  Once a bank holding company becomes subject to enhanced prudential standards, certain of the standards include a transition period before the bank holding company is required to comply. Below we describe several of the enhanced prudential standards’ requirements and the associated transition periods that apply once a bank holding company becomes subject to the requirements.

•

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”).

Bank holding companies are required to submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve.  Failure to submit a satisfactory plan can result in restrictions on the payment of dividends as well as other restrictions. Currently, a bank holding company must comply with the requirements of the CCAR program on January 1 of the first year after becoming subject to enhanced prudential standards.  Under recently finalized, but not yet effective, modifications to the Federal Reserve’s capital planning and stress testing rules, bank holding companies that first become subject to enhanced prudential standards on or before September 30 of a given calendar year must comply with the requirements of the rules on January 1 of the following year.  In contrast, bank holding companies that first become subject to enhanced prudential standards after September 30 of a given calendar year need not comply with the requirements of the capital plan rule until January 1 of the second following year.  These modifications also narrow the bases upon which the Federal Reserve may object to a capital plan for “large and noncomplex” bank holding companies.  A large and noncomplex bank holding company is defined as a bank holding company that has less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets, less than $75 billion in non-bank assets and is not a global systemically important bank holding company under the Federal Reserve’s rules.  Specifically, for large and noncomplex bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve may object to a capital plan if it determines that the bank holding company has not demonstrated an ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the relevant planning horizon.  With respect to bank holding companies that are not large and noncomplex, the Federal Reserve may object on a broader range of bases, including so-called “qualitative” bases.

•

Stress Testing

.  Bank holding companies are required to submit to the Federal Reserve the results of a mid-year and annual company-run stress test and make summaries of such results available to the public. SVB Financial is currently subject to the annual company-run stress test requirements by virtue of having more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. In addition, bank holding companies are subject to an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve, which publicly discloses summaries of the results of the supervisory stress tests.  Currently, if a bank holding company becomes subject to the bi-annual company-run and annual supervisory stress test requirements on or before March 31st of a given year, it must comply with such requirements on January 1st of the following year.  However, if a bank holding company becomes subject to the requirements after March 31st of a given year, it must comply with the requirements on January 1st of the second year following the year in which it becomes subject to the requirements.  Under the Federal Reserve’s recently finalized modifications to its capital planning and stress testing rules, bank holding companies would become subject to stress testing requirements in the year following the first year in which the bank holding company submits a capital plan.

•

Resolution Planning

.  Bank holding companies are required to annually submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure.  Separately, under its regulatory authority, the FDIC requires insured depository institutions that have average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, based on a four-quarter average, to annually submit to the FDIC a plan that enables the FDIC as receiver to resolve the bank under Sections 11 and 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the “FDIA”). A bank holding company or bank must submit its first resolution plan by the next July 1st following the date it becomes subject to the rule, provided the submission date occurs at least 270 days after it becomes subject to the rule.

•

Liquidity Coverage Ratio

.  Pursuant to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) requirement, bank holding companies are required to maintain high-quality liquid assets in accordance with specific quantitative requirements.  A modified, less stringent version of the Federal Reserve’s LCR rule applies to bank holding companies with greater than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and $10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposures (so-called “advanced approaches” banking organizations).  The modified LCR rule, which would apply to SVB Financial upon our becoming subject to enhanced prudential standards, requires subject bank holding companies to maintain sufficient high-quality liquid assets to meet 70 percent of anticipated cash



outflows (as calculated under the rule) on the last business day of the applicable calendar month.  A bank holding company must comply with the modified LCR rule on the first day of the first quarter after becoming subject to it.

•

Risk Management

.  Bank holding companies must comply with enhanced risk management requirements.  These requirements impose standards on the Board of Directors’ risk committee and for a chief risk officer. The enhanced prudential requirements also impose liquidity risk management standards and require subject bank holding companies to conduct regular liquidity stress testing over various time horizons and maintain a buffer of liquid assets based on the results of such stress testing.  Bank holding companies are required to comply with such risk management and liquidity risk management requirements on the first day of the fifth quarter after becoming subject to the enhanced prudential standards.

•

Pillar III Disclosure

.  Bank holding companies are required to make timely qualitative and quantitative disclosures about their regulatory capital, referred to as “Pillar III disclosures.”  Quantitative disclosures must be made quarterly, and qualitative disclosures that do not change each quarter may be disclosed annually.  Bank holding companies are required to make Pillar III disclosures after reporting $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets in their year-end financial reports to the Federal Reserve.  Because the disclosures are backward-looking, a bank holding company makes its first disclosures with respect to data from prior quarters.

Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank

The Bank is a California state-chartered bank, a member of the Federal Reserve and a member of the FDIC. The Bank is subject to primary supervision, periodic examination and regulation by the DBO and the Federal Reserve, as the Bank’s primary federal regulator.  In general, under the California Financial Code, California banks have all the powers of a California corporation, subject to the general limitation of state bank activities and investments under the FDIA.  Specific federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their transactions with affiliates, their foreign operations, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans.  The regulatory structure also gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.  If, as a result of an examination, the DBO or the Federal Reserve should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the Bank’s operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, the DBO and the Federal Reserve, and separately FDIC as insurer of the Bank’s deposits, have prudential authority to:

•

Require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice;

•

Require prior approval for senior executive officer and director changes;

•

Direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of specific minimum capital ratios which may preclude the Bank from being deemed well capitalized for regulatory purposes;

•

Restrict the Bank’s growth geographically, by products and services, or by mergers and acquisitions;

•

Enter into informal or formal enforcement orders, including memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders to take corrective action and enjoin unsafe and unsound practices;

•

Restrict or prohibit the Bank from paying dividends or making other distributions to SVB Financial;

•

Remove officers and directors and assess civil monetary penalties; and

•

Take possession of and close and liquidate the Bank.

Pursuant to applicable California and federal law, state chartered commercial banks are permitted to engage in any activity permissible for national banks.  Therefore, the Bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so-called “closely related to banking” or “nonbanking” activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries, and further, the Bank may conduct certain “financial” activities in a subsidiary that would be impermissible for the Bank itself to the same extent as may a national bank, provided the Bank remains “well-capitalized,” “well-managed” and in satisfactory compliance with the CRA.  The Bank continues to be in satisfactory compliance with the CRA.

Regulatory Capital

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations.  The agencies said that they believe the new rules will result in capital requirements that better reflect banking organizations’ risk profiles.  The rules implement the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.  “Basel III” refers to the internationally agreed regulatory capital framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”).  The new rules



became effective for SVB Financial and the Bank in January 2015, with some rules being transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years.  The new capital rules, among other things, (i) require elevated capital levels for the Bank and SVB Financial; (ii) introduce a new capital measure limited to common equity called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”) and a related regulatory capital ratio of CET 1 to risk-weighted assets; (iii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements; (iv) change the risk-weightings of certain on- and off-balance sheet assets for purposes of risk-based capital ratios; (v) create an additional capital conservation buffer (which will limit dividends and other discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers if not satisfied) above the required capital ratios; (vi) limit what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the various capital requirements; (vii) apply most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, thus potentially requiring higher levels of CET1 in order to meet minimum ratios; and (viii) expand the scope of the deductions from, and adjustments to, capital as compared to prior regulations.  The Basel Committee is engaged in an ongoing review of these new capital requirements, considering whether amendments or other changes may be required.

In addition, the Bank is required to demonstrate its ability to maintain sufficient capital ratios under the scenarios of adverse and severely adverse financial conditions that are part of Federal Reserve’s stress testing requirements.  As noted above, Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion and state member banks with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion, such as SVB Financial and the Bank, are generally required to conduct annual company-run stress tests, the results of which could require us to take certain actions, including raising additional capital.  We are required to submit to the Federal Reserve the results of the annual company-run stress tests and to make summaries of the results of the company-run stress tests available to the public.

Under the new capital rules, CET1 is defined as common stock, plus related surplus, and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less the majority of the regulatory deductions and adjustments.  The new capital rules, like the prior capital rules, specify that total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.  Tier 1 capital for SVB Financial and the Bank consists of common stock, plus related surplus and retained earnings.  Under the new capital rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated debt and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”), in each case, subject to the new capital rules’ specific requirements.

The new capital rules require several changes to regulatory capital deductions and adjustments, subject to a transition period. These changes include, for example, the requirement that deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. In addition, under the previous capital rules, certain effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items included in shareholders’ equity were reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the new capital rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including SVB Financial and the Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items.  We made this election in April 2015 to reduce the potential impact on SVB Financial’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital levels due to periodic volatile changes in long-term interest rates. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and is being phased-in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and a 20% percentage-point increase per year until reaching 100%).

The new capital rules also include changes in the risk-weighting of assets to better reflect perceived credit risk and other risk exposure and require higher tangible common equity components of capital. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status and a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable. Under the new capital rules, the minimum capital ratios are as follows:

•

4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets

•

6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets

•

8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets

•

4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”)

The new capital rules require SVB Financial and the Bank to meet a capital conservation buffer requirement in order to avoid constraints on capital distributions, such as dividends and equity repurchases, and certain bonus compensation for executive officers. To meet the requirement when it is fully phased in, the organization must maintain an amount of CET1 capital that exceeds the buffer level of 2.5% above each of the minimum risk-weighted capital ratios. The requirement is being phased in



over a four year period, which began on January 1, 2016, when the amount of such capital must exceed the buffer level of 0.625%. The buffer level will increase by a 0.625 percentage point each year until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. When the capital conservation buffer requirement is fully phased in, to avoid constraints, a banking organization must maintain the following capital ratios (after any distribution): (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets more than 7.0%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets more than 8.5%, and (iii) total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets more than 10.5%.

With respect to the Bank, the new capital rules also revised the “prompt corrective action” regulations, by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the current 6%); and (iii) eliminating the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The new capital rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any “prompt corrective action” category. See “-Prompt Corrective Action and Other General Enforcement Authority” below.

Although we continue to evaluate the impact that the new capital rules have on SVB Financial and the Bank and monitor developments from the federal banking agencies and the Basel Committee, we believe that SVB Financial and the Bank meet all capital requirements under the new capital rules on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements were effective as of December 31, 2016.  The estimate is based on management’s current interpretation, expectations, and understanding of the new capital rules.  We anticipate that the Bank will continue to exceed the well-capitalized minimum capital requirements, and that SVB Financial will continue to qualify as a financial holding company.

Capital Planning

Banking organizations must have appropriate capital planning processes, with proper oversight from the Board of Directors.  Accordingly, pursuant to a separate, general supervisory letter from the Federal Reserve, bank holding companies are expected to conduct and document comprehensive capital adequacy analyses prior to the declaration of any dividends (on common stock, preferred stock, trust preferred securities or other Tier 1 capital instruments), capital redemptions or capital repurchases.  Moreover, the federal banking agencies have adopted a joint agency policy statement, noting that the adequacy and effectiveness of a bank’s interest rate risk management process and the level of its interest rate exposures are critical factors in the evaluation of the bank’s capital adequacy.  A bank with material weaknesses in its interest rate risk management process or high levels of interest rate exposure relative to its capital will be directed by the relevant federal banking agencies to take corrective actions.

Proprietary Trading and Certain Relationships with Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds

The “Volcker Rule” under the Dodd-Frank Act restricts, among other things, proprietary trading activities of banking holding companies as well as the ability of such entities to sponsor or invest in certain privately offered funds, including certain venture capital, hedge and private equity funds. On December 10, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) adopted final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule. The final regulations became effective on April 1, 2014, subject to a conformance timeline pursuant to which affected entities (referred to as “banking entities”) are required to bring their activities and investments into conformance with the prohibitions and restrictions of the Volcker Rule and the final regulations thereunder.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Volcker Rule prohibits a banking entity from engaging in “proprietary trading,” which is defined as engaging in purchases or sales of securities or certain other financial instruments, as principal, for the “trading account” of the banking entity. Certain forms of proprietary trading may qualify as “permitted activities,” and thus not be subject to the ban on proprietary trading, such as market-making related activities, risk-mitigating hedging activities, trading in U.S. government or agency obligations, or certain other U.S. state or municipal obligations, and the obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. Based on this definition and the exceptions provided under the final regulations, we do not believe that compliance with the Volcker Rule's proprietary trading prohibition is likely to have a material effect on our business or operations.

Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the rule prohibits a banking entity from sponsoring or investing in “covered funds,” which includes many venture capital, private equity and hedge funds.  One such exception permits a banking entity to sponsor and invest in a covered fund that it organizes and offers to customers, provided that additional requirements are met.  These permitted investments generally are limited to 3% of the total ownership interests in each covered fund. In addition, the aggregate investments a banking entity makes in all covered funds generally are limited to 3% of the institution’s Tier 1 capital.

Under the final regulations, the Volcker Rule’s prohibitions and restrictions apply to SVB Financial, the Bank and any affiliate of SVB Financial or the Bank.  SVB Financial maintains investments in certain venture capital and private equity funds that it did not sponsor; maintains investments in sponsored funds that exceed 3% of each such fund’s total ownership interests; and



maintains aggregate investments in all covered funds that may exceed 3% of its Tier 1 capital.  SVB Financial (including its affiliates) expects, therefore, that it will be required to reduce the level of its investments in covered funds over time and to forego investment opportunities in certain funds in the future.  SVB Financial is generally required by the final rules to come into conformance with the Volcker Rule’s requirements regarding covered funds by July 2017 with respect to covered funds in which SVB Financial invested or SVB Financial sponsored as of December 31, 2013. In addition, the Federal Reserve may extend the conformance deadline for up to an additional five years (until July 2022) for investments that are considered illiquid. We have applied to the Federal Reserve for the maximum extension (up to July 2022) available to us.  However, there is no guarantee that the Federal Reserve will grant this extension. In order to be compliant with the Volcker Rule, SVB Financial may be required to reduce some or all of its investments in covered funds by July 2017. At least some of SVB Financial's investments in covered funds will likely reduce over time in the ordinary course before compliance with the Volcker Rule is required. However, a forced sale or restructuring of SVB Financial's investments in covered funds due to the Volcker Rule would likely result in SVB Financial receiving less than the carrying value of such investments (or other adverse consequences), as there could be a limited secondary market for these investments and SVB Financial may be unable to sell them in orderly transactions.

As of

December 31, 2016

, we estimate that our total venture capital and private equity fund investments deemed to be prohibited covered fund interests and therefore subject to the Volcker Rule’s restrictions, had an aggregate carrying value of approximately

$194 million

(and an aggregate fair value of approximately

$300 million

). These covered fund interests are comprised of interests attributable solely to the Company in our consolidated managed funds and certain of our non−marketable securities.

We continue to assess the financial impact of these rules on our fund investments, as well as the impact of other Volcker Rule restrictions on other areas of our business.  See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of Part I below.

The Volcker Rule also requires banking entities to design and implement a compliance program reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the Volcker Rule. If SVB Financial reports total consolidated assets as of the previous calendar year end of $50 billion or more, it will become subject to the Volcker Rule’s enhanced compliance program requirements, which, among other things, require an annual attestation from the chief executive officer regarding the design and effectiveness of the compliance program.

Prompt Corrective Action and Other General Enforcement Authority

State and federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action against an insured bank and its holding company.  The FDIA requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions, including those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. The law requires each federal banking agency to promulgate regulations defining five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios:  well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Further, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment.

Bank holding companies and insured banks also may be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by any applicable agency or term of a written agreement with that agency.  In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include the issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal agreements; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers, directors, and other institution−affiliated parties; the termination of the bank’s deposit insurance; the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank; and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.



Safety and Soundness Guidelines

Banking regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired.  The guidelines establish operational and managerial standards generally relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest-rate exposure; (v) asset growth and asset quality; and (vi) compensation, fees and benefits.  In addition, the bank regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. The Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential standards require bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more to establish and maintain risk management committees for their boards of directors to oversee the bank holding companies’ risk management frameworks. In January 2015, we formed a risk committee of our Board of Directors. Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion and greater are subject to more stringent board risk committee and risk management requirements, including liquidity risk requirements.

Restrictions on Dividends

Dividends from the Bank constitute one of the primary sources of cash for SVB Financial. The Bank is subject to various federal and state statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends, including applicable provisions of the California Financial Code and the prompt corrective action regulations.  In addition, the banking agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends, depending upon the Bank’s financial condition, if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Further, under the federal prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.”

It is the Federal Reserve’s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition.  It is also the Federal Reserve’s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries.  Additionally, in consideration of the recent financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.

Transactions with Affiliates

Transactions between the Bank and its operating subsidiaries (such as SVB Securities and SVB Asset Management) on the one hand, and the Bank’s affiliates (such as SVB Financial, SVB Analytics or an entity affiliated with our SVB Capital business) on the other, are subject to restrictions imposed by federal and state law, designed to protect the Bank and its subsidiaries from engaging in unfavorable behavior with their affiliates.  The Dodd-Frank Act further extended the definition of an “affiliate” to include any investment fund to which the Bank or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser.  More specifically, these restrictions, contained in the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W, prevent SVB Financial and other affiliates from borrowing from, or entering into other credit transactions with, the Bank or its operating subsidiaries unless the loans or other credit transactions are secured by specified amounts of collateral, and also require that the Bank enter into such transaction on terms no less favorable to the Bank than the terms of an arms’ length transaction with an unaffiliated party.  Moreover, all loans and credit transactions and other “covered transactions” by the Bank and its operating subsidiaries with any one affiliate are limited, in the aggregate, to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus; and all loans and credit transactions and other “covered transactions” by the Bank and its operating subsidiaries with all affiliates are limited, in the aggregate, to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus.  For this purpose, a “covered transaction” generally includes, among other things, a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, including a purchase of assets subject to an agreement to repurchase; a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate; the acceptance of a security issued by an affiliate as collateral for an extension of credit to any borrower; the borrowing or lending of securities where the Bank has credit exposure to the affiliate; the acceptance of “other debt obligations” of an affiliate as collateral for a loan to a third party; any derivative transaction that causes the Bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate; and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. The Dodd-Frank Act treats derivative transactions resulting in credit exposure to an affiliate as covered transactions.  It expands the transactions for which collateral is required to be maintained, and for all such transactions, it requires collateral to be maintained at all times.  In addition, the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act establishes certain prohibitions, restrictions and requirements (known as “Super 23A” and “Super 23B”) on transactions between a covered fund and a banking entity that serves as an investment manager, investment adviser, organizer and offeror, or sponsor with respect to that covered fund, regardless whether the banking entity has an ownership interest in the fund.



Loans to Insiders

Extensions of credit by the Bank to insiders of both the Bank and SVB Financial are subject to prohibitions and other restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve’s Regulation O.  For purposes of these limits, “insiders” include directors, executive officers and principal stockholders of the Bank or SVB Financial and their related interests.  The term “related interest” means a company controlled by a director, executive officer or principal stockholder of the Bank or SVB Financial.  The Bank may not extend credit to an insider of the Bank or SVB Financial unless the loan is made on substantially the same terms as, and subject to credit underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-insiders.  Under federal banking regulations, the Bank may not extend credit to insiders in an amount, when aggregated with all other extensions of credit, is greater than $500,000 without prior approval from the Bank’s Board of Directors (with any interested person abstaining from participating directly or indirectly in the voting).  California law, the federal regulations and the Dodd-Frank Act place additional restrictions on loans to insiders, and generally prohibit loans to executive officers other than for certain specified purposes.  The Bank is required to maintain records regarding insiders and extensions of credit to them.

Premiums for Deposit Insurance

The FDIC insures our customer deposits through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) up to prescribed limits for each depositor.   Due to higher levels of bank failures during the 2008 economic recession, the FDIC’s resolution costs increased, which depleted the DIF.  In order to restore the DIF to its statutorily mandated minimum of 1.35% of total deposits, the FDIC has increased deposit insurance premium rates.  The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020.  Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, such as the Bank, are responsible for funding the increase.  The Bank bases its assessment rate on a risk−based scorecard calculation provided by the FDIC.  In addition, the FDIC retains the authority to further increase the Bank’s assessment rates and the FDIC has established a higher reserve ratio of 2% as a long-term goal which goes beyond what is required by statute.  Continued increases in our FDIC insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on the Bank’s results of operations. For the years ended

December 31, 2016

and 2015, we recorded

$30.3 million

and $25.5 million, respectively, in FDIC assessments expense.

Consumer Regulations

The Bank is subject to many federal consumer protection statutes and regulations, such as the CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B), the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (Regulation E), the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), the National Flood Insurance Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act and various federal and state privacy protection laws.  In addition, the CFPB has the authority to conduct examinations for all depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion or more, which includes the Bank.  The CFPB’s mandate is to promulgate consumer regulations and ensure that consumer financial practices at large banks, such as the Bank, comply with consumer financial protection legal requirements.  The CFPB’s authority includes the ability to examine all subsidiaries and affiliates of the Bank as well. Penalties for violating these laws could subject the Bank to lawsuits and could also result in administrative penalties, including, civil monetary penalties, remediation for affected consumers and reimbursements and orders to halt expansion/existing activities.  The CFPB has broad authority to institute various enforcement actions, including investigations, civil actions, cease and desist proceedings and the ability to refer criminal findings to the Department of Justice.  The Bank and SVB Financial are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive and abusive, corrupt or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition.

Examination and enforcement by the state and federal banking agencies, and other such enforcement authorities, for non-compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations have increased and become more intense.  The advent of the CFPB further heightens oversight and review of compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations.  Due to these heightened regulatory concerns, including increased enforcement of the CRA by the federal banking agencies, and new powers and authority of the CFPB, the Bank and its affiliates may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in their local community.

Anti-Money Laundering Regulations

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (“USA PATRIOT Act”) of 2001 and its implementing regulations substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by requiring insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act and its regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to certain conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to consider the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. Material deficiencies in anti-money laundering compliance, and non-



compliance with related requirements such as the U.S. economic and trade sanctions regimes, can result in public enforcement actions by the bank regulatory agencies and other government agencies, including the imposition of civil money penalties and supervisory restrictions on growth and expansion.  Such enforcement actions could also have serious reputational consequences for SVB Financial and the Bank.

Regulation of Certain Subsidiaries

SVB Securities is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and a member of FINRA, and accordingly, is subject to regulation by both agencies.  SVB Securities is also a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.  As a broker-dealer, SVB Securities must comply with a variety of regulations associated with its business lines, including (i) rules that govern the registration and examination of SVB Securities and its employees, (ii) substantive requirements and prohibitions concerning its relationships with its customers and counterparties, (iii) anti-fraud provisions and (iv) requirements to develop and maintain internal compliance and supervisory programs.  SVB Securities also must comply with the financial responsibility rules governing broker-dealers, including Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act which is designed to measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer and seek to ensure its financial stability in light of its activities.  Under this rule, SVB Securities is required to maintain minimum net capital calculated in accordance with a specified formula in order to help meet its continuing commitments to customers and others.  Under certain circumstances, this rule could limit the ability of the Bank to withdraw capital from SVB Securities or require a capital infusion to support growth in the business or new activities.  SVB Asset Management and SVB Wealth Advisory are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and are subject to its rules and regulations.  In addition, following completion of various studies on investment advisers and broker−dealers required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has, among other things, recommended to Congress that it consider various means to enhance the SEC’s examination authority over investment advisers, which may have an impact on SVB Asset Management and SVB Wealth Advisory that we cannot currently assess.  The regulatory environment for broker-dealers and investment advisers is constantly evolving as the regulators adopt new rules and interpretations.

International Regulation

Our international-based subsidiaries and global activities, including our banking branch in the United Kingdom and our joint venture bank in China are subject to the respective laws and regulations of those countries and the regions in which they operate.  This includes laws and regulations promulgated by, but not limited to, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  To the extent we are able to commence operations as anticipated in Canada and Germany or in any other international market, we will also become subject to the regulatory regimes of those jurisdictions.  Moreover, promulgation by standard-setting bodies that are charged with the development of international regulatory frameworks, such as the Basel Committee, can affect the Bank and SVB Financial globally as national regulators implement the frameworks in local jurisdictions.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our business faces significant risks, including credit, market and liquidity, operational, legal and regulatory and strategic and reputational risks. The factors described below are not intended to serve as a comprehensive listing of the risks we face and are generally applicable to more than one of the following categories of risks. Additional risks and uncertainties that we have not identified as material, or of we currently are not aware, may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following factors occurs, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Credit Risks

Because of the credit profile of our loan portfolio, our levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs can be volatile. We may need to make material provisions for loan losses in any period, which could reduce net income or increase net losses in that period.

Our loan portfolio has a credit profile different from that of most other banking companies. The credit profiles of our clients vary across our loan portfolio, based on the nature of the lending we do for different market segments. In our portfolios for early-



stage and mid-stage privately-held companies, many of our loans are made to companies with modest or negative cash flows and/or no established record of profitable operations, primarily within the technology and life science and healthcare industries. Consequently, repayment of these loans is often dependent upon receipt by our borrowers of additional equity financing from venture capitalists or others, or in some cases, a successful sale to a third party, public offering or other form of liquidity or "exit" event. Although many emerging companies have been able to obtain liquidity through venture capital-backed financing as well as various other exit opportunities at relatively high valuations in recent years, there can be no assurance that they will be able to continue to obtain funding at current valuation levels, if at all. If current economic conditions weaken or do not continue to improve, such activities may slow down, or valuations may drop in a meaningful manner, which may impact the financial health of our client companies. In such case, investors may provide financing in a more selective manner, at lower levels, and/or on less favorable terms, if at all, any of which may have an adverse effect on our borrowers' ability to repay their loans to us. In addition, because of the intense competition and rapid technological change that characterizes the technology, and life science and healthcare industry sectors in which most of our borrowers reside, as well as periodic volatility in the market prices for their securities, a borrower’s financial position can deteriorate rapidly. Collateral for many of our loans often includes intellectual property and other intangible assets, which are difficult to value and may not be readily salable in the case of default. As a result, even if a loan is secured, we may not be able to fully recover the amounts owed to us, if at all.

In addition, a meaningful portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of our larger loans, which could increase the impact on us of any single borrower default.  As of December 31, 2016, gross loans equal to or greater than $20 million to any single client (individually or in the aggregate) totaled $8.9 billion, or 44.4 percent, of our portfolio.  These larger loans have over time represented, and continue to represent, an increasingly greater portion of our total loan portfolio.  They include capital call lines of credit to our private equity and venture capital clients, as well as other loans made to our later-stage and larger corporate clients, and may be made to companies with greater levels of debt relative to their equity, balance sheet liquidity, or cash flow.  Additionally, we have continued our efforts to grow our loan portfolio by agenting or arranging larger syndicated credit facilities and participating in larger syndicates agented by other financial institutions as well as making sponsor-led buyout loans, which are leveraged buyout or recapitalization financings typically sponsored by our private equity clients.  In those arrangements where we do not act as the lead syndicate agent, our control or decision-making ability over the credit facility is typically limited to our participation interest.

Further, the repayment of financing arrangements we enter into with our clients may be dependent on the financial condition or ability of third parties to meet their payment obligations to our clients.  For example, we enter into formula-based financing arrangements that are secured by our clients’ accounts receivable from third parties with whom they do business.  We also make loans secured by letters of credit issued by other third party banks and enter into letters of credit discounting arrangements, the repayment of which may be dependent on the reimbursement by third party banks.  We also extend recurring revenue-based lines of credit, where repayment may be dependent on borrowers’ revenues from third parties.  Further, in our loan portfolio of private equity and venture capital firm clients, many of our clients have lines of credit, the repayment of which are dependent on the payment of capital calls or management fees by the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by these firms.  In recent periods, we have increased the levels of these capital call lines of credit.  Ultimately, these third parties may not meet their financial obligations to our clients or to us, which could have an adverse impact on us.

We also lend to private equity and venture capital professionals primarily through SVB Private Bank.  These individual clients may face difficulties meeting their financial commitments, especially during a challenging economic environment, and may be unable to repay their loans.  In certain instances, we may also relax loan covenants and conditions or extend loan terms to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulties.  While such determinations are based on an assessment of various factors including access to additional capital in the near term, there can be no assurance that such continued support will result in any borrower meeting his or her financial commitments. In addition, we lend to premium wineries and vineyards through SVB Wine. Repayment of loans made to these clients may be dependent on overall wine demand and sales, or other sources of financing or income which may be adversely affected by a challenging economic environment, as well as overall grape supply which may be adversely affected by poor weather, heavy rains, flooding, drought, earthquake or other natural conditions.

Based on the credit profile of our overall loan portfolio, our level of nonperforming loans, loan charge-offs and allowance for loan losses can be volatile and can vary materially from period to period. Increases in our level of nonperforming loans or loan charge-offs may require us to increase our provision for loan losses in any period, which could reduce our net income or cause net losses in that period. Additionally, such increases in our level of nonperforming loans or loan charge-offs may also have an adverse effect on our capital ratios, credit ratings and market perceptions of us. See “

Loans

” under “

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Consolidated Financial Condition

” under Part II, Item 7 of this report.



Our allowance for loan losses is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors, and may not be adequate to absorb loan losses.

As a lender, we face the risk that our borrower clients will fail to pay their loans when due.  If borrower defaults cause large aggregate losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  We reserve for such losses by establishing an allowance for loan losses, the increase of which results in a charge to our earnings as a provision for loan losses.  Although we have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses that uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the forecasts and establishment of loan losses are also dependent upon the subjective experience and judgment of our management.  Actual losses are difficult to forecast, especially if such losses stem from factors beyond our historical experience or are otherwise inconsistent with our credit quality assessments.  Moreover, government regulators, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we make in determining the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses.  These regulators may conclude that changes are necessary, which could impact our overall credit portfolio.  Such changes could result in, among other things, modifications to our methodology or models, reclassification or downgrades of our loans, increases in our allowance for loan losses or other credit costs, imposition of new or more stringent concentration limits, restrictions in our lending activities and/or recognition of further losses.  There can be no assurance that our allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to absorb future loan losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The borrowing needs of our clients may be unpredictable, especially during a challenging economic environment. We may not be able to meet our unfunded credit commitments, or adequately reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.

A commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established under the agreement.  The actual borrowing needs of our clients under these credit commitments have historically been lower than the contractual amount of the commitments.  As a result, we typically have a substantial amount of total unfunded credit commitments reflected off our balance sheet and a significant portion of these commitments ultimately expire without being drawn upon.  See

Note 18—"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

for additional details.  However, the actual borrowing needs of our clients may exceed our expected funding requirements.  For example, our client companies may be more dependent on our credit commitments in a challenging economic environment due to the lack of available credit elsewhere, the increasing costs of credit through other channels, or the limited availability of financings from private equity or venture capital firms.  In addition, limited partner investors of our private equity and venture capital fund clients may fail to meet their underlying investment commitments due to liquidity or other financing difficulties, which may impact our clients’ borrowing needs.  Any failure to meet our unfunded credit commitments in accordance with the actual borrowing needs of our clients may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.

Further, although we have established a reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments, the level of the reserve is determined by a methodology similar to that used to establish our allowance for loan losses in our funded loan portfolio. While the reserve is susceptible to significant changes, it is primarily based on credit commitments outstanding less the amounts that have been funded, the amount of the unfunded portion that we expect to be utilized in the future, credit quality of the loan credit commitments, and management’s estimates and judgment.  There can be no assurance that our reserve for unfunded credit commitments will be adequate to provide for actual losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments.  An increase in the reserve for unfunded credit commitments in any period may result in a charge to our earnings, which could reduce our net income or increase net losses in that period.

Market and Liquidity Risks

Our current level of interest rate spread may decline in the future. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread, caused by sustained periods of low market interest rates or changes in our clients' preferences for interest-bearing deposit products in periods of rising interest rates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

A significant portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and internal borrowings, and the interest rates and fees we receive on our interest-earning assets such as loans extended to our clients, securities held in our investment portfolio and excess cash held to manage short-term liquidity.  The interest rates we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities and receive on our interest-earning assets, and therefore our interest rate spread, can be affected by the mix of the types of loans, investment securities, deposits and other liabilities on our balance sheet, as well as a variety of external factors beyond our control such as competition,



inflation, recession, global economic disruptions, unemployment and the fiscal and monetary policies of various governmental bodies.  For example, changes in key variable market interest rates, such as the Federal Funds, National Prime, the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or Treasury rates, generally impact our interest rate spread. While changes in interest rates do not generally produce equivalent changes in the revenues earned from our interest-earning assets and the expenses associated with our interest-bearing liabilities, increases in market interest rates are nevertheless likely to cause our interest rate spread to increase. Conversely, if interest rates decline, our interest rate spread will likely decline.  In response to the last global economic recession, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions took monetary policy actions, including the utilization of quantitative easing, to create and maintain a low interest rate environment.  In December 2015, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2007.  More recently, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates again in December 2016 and may institute further changes in the future. Increases, or sustained periods of increases, in interest rates may result in a change in the mix of non-interest and interest bearing accounts, and the level of off-balance sheet market-based investment preferred by our clients, which may have a negative impact on our interest rate spread.  However, if interest rates do not rise, low rates could constrain our interest rate spread and may adversely affect our business forecasts.  In addition, changes in the method of determining LIBOR or other reference rates, or uncertainty related to such potential changes, may adversely affect the value of reference rate-linked debt securities that we hold or issue, which could further impact our interest rate spread.  Any material reduction in our interest rate spread could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.

Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.

Liquidity is essential to our business, both at the SVB Financial and the Bank level.  We require sufficient liquidity to meet our expected financial obligations, as well as unexpected requirements stemming from client activity and market changes.  Primary liquidity resources for SVB Financial include cash flow from investments and interest in financial assets held by operating subsidiaries other than the Bank; to the extent declared, dividends from the Bank, its main operating subsidiary; and as needed, periodic capital market transactions offering debt and equity instruments in the public and private markets.  The primary source of liquidity for the Bank is client deposits.  When needed, wholesale borrowing capacity in the form of short- and long-term borrowings secured by our portfolio of high quality investment securities, long-term capital market debt issuances and unsecured overnight funding channels available to us in the Federal Funds market supplement our liquidity.  An inability to maintain or raise funds through these sources could have a substantial negative effect, individually or collectively, on SVB Financial and the Bank's liquidity.  Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms attractive to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general.  For example, factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us, a reduction in our credit rating, any damage to our reputation or any other decrease in depositor or investor confidence in our creditworthiness and business.  Our access to liquidity could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe volatility or disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole.  Any such event or failure to manage our liquidity effectively could affect our competitive position, increase our borrowing costs and the interest rates we pay on deposits, limit our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

Our equity warrant assets, venture capital and private equity fund investments and direct equity investment portfolio gains depend upon the performance of our portfolio investments and the general condition of the public and private equity and merger and acquisition markets, which are uncertain and may vary materially by period.

In connection with negotiated credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock in private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science and healthcare industries.  We have also made investments through SVB Financial and our SVB Capital family of funds in venture capital funds and direct investments in companies, many of which are required to be carried at fair value or are impacted by changes in fair value.  The fair value of these warrants and investments are reflected in our financial statements and are adjusted on a quarterly basis.  Fair value changes are generally recorded as unrealized gains or losses through consolidated net income.  However, the timing and amount of changes in fair value, if any, of these financial instruments depend on factors beyond our control, including the perceived and actual performance of the companies or funds in which we invest, fluctuations in the market prices of the preferred or common stock of the portfolio companies, the timing of our receipt of relevant financial information from these companies, market volatility and interest rate factors and legal and contractual restrictions.  Moreover, the timing and amount of our realization of actual net proceeds, if any, from our disposition of these financial instruments also often depend on factors beyond our control.  In addition to those mentioned above, such factors include the level of public offering and merger and acquisition or other exit activity, legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell our equity positions (including the expiration of any “lock-up” agreements) and the timing of any actual dispositions.  Because of the inherent variability of these financial instruments and the markets in which they are bought and sold, their fair market value might increase or decrease materially from period to period,



and the net proceeds ultimately realized upon disposition might be materially different than the then-current recorded fair market value.

In addition, depending on the fair value of these warrants and direct equity investments, a meaningful portion of the aggregate fair value of our total warrant and direct equity investment portfolios may, from time to time, be concentrated in a limited number of warrants and direct equity investments.  Valuation changes in one or more of these warrants or direct equity investments may have a material impact on the valuation of our total investment portfolio. We cannot predict future realized or unrealized gains or losses, and any such gains or losses are likely to vary materially from period to period.  See

Note 13—"Derivative Financial Instruments" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

for additional details.

Public equity offerings, mergers and acquisitions or a slowdown in private equity or venture capital investment levels may reduce the borrowing needs of our clients, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

While an active market for public equity offerings and merger and acquisition activity generally has positive implications for our business, one negative consequence is that our clients may pay off or reduce their loans with us if they complete a public equity offering, are acquired by or merge with another entity or otherwise receive a significant equity investment. Moreover, our capital call lines of credit are typically utilized by our private equity and venture capital fund clients to make investments prior to receipt of capital called from their respective limited partners. A slowdown in overall private equity or venture capital investment levels may reduce the need for our clients to borrow from our capital call lines of credit. Any significant reduction in the outstanding amounts of our loans or under our lines of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Operational Risks

If we fail to retain our key employees or recruit new employees, our growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We rely on key personnel, including a substantial number of employees who have technical expertise in their subject matter area and a strong network of relationships with individuals and institutions in the markets we serve. In addition, as we expand in international markets, we will need to hire local personnel within those markets. If we were to have less success in recruiting and retaining these employees than our competitors, for reasons including domestic or foreign regulatory restrictions on compensation practices or the availability of more attractive opportunities elsewhere, our growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Moreover, equity awards are an important component of our compensation program, especially for our executive officers and other members of senior management. The extent of shares available for grant in connection with such equity awards pursuant to our incentive compensation plans is generally subject to stockholder approval. Our grants are also subject to our internal equity burn rate limit. If we do not have sufficient shares to grant to existing or new employees, there could be an adverse effect on our recruiting and retention efforts, which could impact our growth and results of operations.

The occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

As a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. In recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, we remain at risk for attempted electronic fraudulent activity, as well as attempts at security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents. Moreover, in recent periods, large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us, which could subject us to potential liability.



Information pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on our networks and systems, as well as those of our clients and certain of our third party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our clients' confidence. Breaches of information security also may occur, and in infrequent cases have occurred, through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or our clients’ or counterparties’ confidential information, including employees and third-party contractors. In addition, SVB provides card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with those merchants and/or with the payment networks.  Under these agreements, we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data security breach. Furthermore, SVB's cardholders use their debit and credit cards to make purchases from third parties or through third party processing services. As such, SVB is subject to risk from data breaches of such third-party's information systems or their payment processors, including due to resulting unauthorized card use. Such a data security breach could compromise SVB account information, cause losses on card accounts and increase litigation costs.  SVB may suffer losses associated with reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent transactions on customers' card accounts, as well as for other costs related to data security breaches, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts.

We also offer certain services that allow non-accountholders to process payments through SVB’s systems, as well as financial analytics services. In the course of providing those services, we may obtain sensitive data about customers who do not otherwise hold accounts with us, including information regarding accounts held at other institutions, as well as profit and loss and other proprietary financial or other information regarding our customers or the non-accountholders they service. In the event of a data breach, this sensitive information may be exposed and could subject us to claims for damages.

In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. The more recent advent of state-sponsored or terrorist-sponsored efforts to hack or disable information technology systems increases risks, since the motivation may be for geopolitical as much as for financial gain. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, our inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our clients; our loss of business and/or clients; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business; force majeure claims by us or critical suppliers; our inability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability -  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

More generally, publicized information concerning security and cyber-related problems could inhibit the use or growth of electronic or web-based applications or solutions as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Such publicity may also cause damage to our reputation as a financial institution. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.

We face risks associated with the ability of our information technology systems and our people and processes to support our operations and future growth effectively.

Our information technology systems, people and internal business processes are critical to our operations and future growth.  Our systems and processes need to be sufficiently scalable to operate effectively, and we need to have the appropriate talent to support our business.  As a result, we continue to invest in technology and more automated solutions in order to optimize the efficiency of our core operational and administrative infrastructure.  In the absence of having effective automated solutions, we may rely on manual processes which may be more prone to error.  Moreover, as we evolve, we may further install or implement new systems and processes or otherwise replace, upgrade or make other modifications to our existing systems and processes.  These changes could be costly and require significant investment in the training of our employees and other third-party partners, as well as impose substantial demands on management time.  If  we do not implement new initiatives or utilize new technologies effectively or in accordance with regulatory requirements, or if our people (including outsourced business partners) are not appropriately trained or developed  or do not perform their functions properly, we could experience business interruptions or other system failures which, among other things, could result in inefficiencies, revenue losses, loss of clients, exposure to fraudulent activities, regulatory enforcement actions or damage to our reputation, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.



Business disruptions and interruptions due to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our operations can be subject to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, severe weather, public health issues, power failures, telecommunication loss, major accidents, terrorist attacks, acts of war, and other natural and man-made events.  For example, our corporate headquarters and some of our critical business offices are located in California, near major earthquake faults.  An earthquake or other event of disaster could cause severe destruction, disruption or interruption to our operations or property.  We and other financial institutions generally must resume operations promptly following any interruption.  If we were to suffer a disruption or interruption and were not able to resume normal operations within a period consistent with industry standards, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in a material manner.  In addition, depending on the nature and duration of the disruption or interruption, we might become vulnerable to fraud, additional expense or other losses, or to a loss of business and clients.  Although we have implemented a business continuity management program that we continue to enhance on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that the program will adequately mitigate the risks of such business disruptions and interruptions.

Additionally, natural disasters and external events, including those occurring in and around the state of California,  could affect the business and operations of our clients, which could impair their ability to pay their loans or fees when due, impair the value of collateral securing their loans, cause our clients to reduce their deposits with us, or otherwise adversely affect their business dealings with us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. A significant portion of our client borrowers, including our premium winery and vineyard clients, our Private Bank mortgage clients and other corporate clients, are located in or have offices in the state of California, which has historically experienced severe natural disasters resulting in disruptions to businesses and damage to property. If there is a major earthquake, flood, fire, drought or other natural disaster in California or elsewhere in the markets in which we operate, our borrowers may experience uninsured property losses or sustained disruption to business or loss that may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their loan obligations.

We face reputation and business risks due to our interactions with business partners, service providers and other third parties.

We rely on third parties, both in the United States and internationally in countries such as the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, China, Israel and India, to provide services to us and our clients or otherwise act as partners in our business activities in a variety of ways, including through the provision of key components of our business infrastructure. We expect these third parties to perform services for us, fulfill their obligations to us, accurately inform us of relevant information, and conduct their activities in a manner that reflects positively on our brand and business. Although we manage exposure to such third party risk through a variety of means [including the performance of due diligence and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance], there can be no assurance these efforts will be effective. Any failure of our business partners, service providers or other third parties to meet their commitments to us or to perform in accordance with our expectations could result in operational disruptions, increased expenditures, regulatory actions in which we may be held responsible for the actions of third parties, damage to our reputation and the loss of clients, which in turn could harm our business and operations, strategic growth objectives and financial performance.

The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.

Financial services institutions are interrelated because of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships.  We routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, payment processors, and other institutional clients, which may result in payment obligations to us or to our clients due to products we have arranged.  Many of these transactions expose us to credit and market risk that may cause our counterparty or client to default. In addition, we are exposed to market risk when the collateral we hold cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the secured obligation.  Any losses arising from such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.

In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other information relating to their business or financial condition.  We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports or other certifications of their auditors or accountants. For example, under our accounts receivable financing arrangements, we rely on information, such as invoices, contracts and other supporting documentation, provided by our clients and their account debtors to determine the amount of credit to extend. Similarly, in deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our customers’ representations that their financial statements conform to U.S. GAAP (or other applicable accounting standards in foreign markets) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer.  If we rely on materially



misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information in evaluating the credit-worthiness or other risk-profiles of our clients or counterparties, we could be subject to loan losses, regulatory action, reputational harm or experience other adverse effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our accounting policies and methods are key to how we report our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain.

Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.  Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with U.S. GAAP and reflect management's judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition or results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential holders of our securities could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.

Maintaining and adapting our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is expensive and requires significant management attention.  Moreover, as we continue to grow, our internal controls may become more complex and require additional resources to ensure they remain effective amid dynamic regulatory and other guidance. Failure to implement effective controls or difficulties encountered in the process may harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. We may also face regulatory enforcement or other actions, including the potential delisting of our securities from the NASDAQ Stock Market. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as the trading price of our securities, and could potentially subject us to litigation.

We face risks associated with international operations.

One important component of our strategy is to expand internationally. We currently have international offices in the United Kingdom, Israel, Hong Kong and China, including a joint-venture bank in China. We further plan to expand our operations and business activities in some of our current international markets, as well as expand our business beyond those markets, including in Germany and Canada. Our efforts to expand our business internationally carry with them certain risks, including risks arising from the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations; risks associated with leveraging and doing business with local business partners through joint ventures, strategic arrangements or other partnerships; and, other general operational risks. In addition, there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international basis, including, among others, legal, regulatory and tax requirements and restrictions, uncertainties regarding liability, tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, the incremental requirement of management's attention and resources, differing technology standards or customer requirements, data security or transfer risks, cultural differences, political and economic risks such as uncertainty created by the approval of an advisory referendum by a majority of voters in the United Kingdom to the leave the European Union in June 2016, and financial risks, including currency and payment risks such as fluctuation in the value of the euro and Chinese yuan (renminbi). These risks could hinder our ability, or the ability of our local partners, to service our clients effectively, and adversely affect the success of our international operations, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we face risks that our employees and affiliates may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing our international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act, anti-corruption laws, privacy laws, economic and trade sanctions requirements and other foreign laws and regulations.  Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could, among other things, result in enforcement actions and fines against us, as well as limitations on our conduct, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities, impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business, or result in higher costs to us, and the stringency of the regulatory framework applicable to us may increase if, and as, our asset size continues to grow.

SVB Financial Group, including the Bank, is extensively regulated under federal and state laws and regulations governing financial institutions, including those imposed by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the CFPB, and the DBO, as well as various regulatory authorities that govern our global activities.  Federal and state laws and regulations govern, restrict, limit or otherwise



affect the activities in which we may engage and may affect our ability to expand our business over time, result in an increase in our compliance costs, including higher FDIC insurance premiums, and may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers and employees. Further, the stringency of the federal bank prudential regulatory framework that applies to us may increase as our asset size grows. In particular, under the Dodd-Frank Act and current Federal Reserve regulations, certain enhanced prudential standards will apply to us if we reach or exceed $50 billion in total consolidated assets. In addition, a change in the applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy could have a material adverse effect on our business, including limiting or imposing conditions on the types of financial services and products we may offer or increasing the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products. These laws and regulations also require financial institutions, including SVB Financial and the Bank, to maintain certain minimum levels of capital and meet other minimum financial standards, which may require us to raise additional capital in the future, affect our ability to use our capital resources for other business purposes or affect our overall business strategies and plans. Furthermore, following the 2008 financial crisis, the Basel Committee adopted additional capital, leverage and liquidity standards under the Basel Accord (known as “Basel III”), and has since proposed additional standards.  The Federal Reserve has also adopted regulations that generally align with these international standards, and have the effect of raising our capital requirements beyond those previously in place.  Such requirements also include limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executives if certain minimum capital requirements are not maintained.  The Federal Reserve also has adopted certain stress testing requirements, the results of which we are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and to disclose to the public. In addition, depending on the results of the stress tests, we could be required to raise additional capital or take certain other actions.  Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board, FDIC and OCC have announced their intentions to issue additional cybersecurity regulations that, when adopted, may require us to implement specific measures to enhance our cybersecurity controls, policies and procedures.  Increased regulatory requirements (and the associated compliance costs), whether due to the adoption of new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations, or more expansive or aggressive interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We are subject to the Volcker Rule, which limits certain trading and investment activities by banking entities and has required us to modify our historical venture capital fund investment and sponsorship activities.

The Volcker Rule restricts, among other things, proprietary trading activities by banking entities as well as their ability to sponsor or invest in certain privately offered funds, including certain venture capital, hedge and private equity funds.  Although we do not believe that we engage in any proprietary trading that is prohibited under the Volcker Rule, certain of our historical venture capital fund investment and sponsorship businesses and activities are affected by the rule.  In particular, the Volcker Rule restricts or limits us from sponsoring or having ownership interests in “covered” funds including venture capital and private equity funds.  Under this rule, we will have to wind-down, transfer, divest or otherwise ensure the termination or expiration of any prohibited interests prior to the end of the applicable conformance period.  In general, we believe we conformed our activities to these restrictions by July 21, 2015; however, certain legacy investments and relationships are subject to an extended conformance period that ends in July 2017.  The Federal Reserve may extend the conformance deadline for up to an additional five years, until July 2022, for investments that are considered illiquid. Although we have applied for the maximum extension available to us, there can be no assurance that we will be granted the extension we have sought.  As a result, we may be required to divest our prohibited interests within a short period of time which may result in sales at possibly distressed, or otherwise less than expected, levels.  Additionally, any failure to divest prohibited interests as required may result in regulatory actions against us, including being subject to increased regulatory capital requirements and/or additional regulatory restrictions.

We estimate that our total venture capital and private equity fund investments deemed to be prohibited covered fund interests had an aggregate carrying value of approximately

$194 million

(and an aggregate fair value of approximately

$300 million

) as of

December 31, 2016

. These covered fund interests are comprised of interests attributable, solely, to us in our consolidated managed funds and certain of our non-marketable securities. The Volcker Rule restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our investment portfolio and results of operations. The actual impact from these restrictions will be dependent on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain regulatory extensions, our ability to sell the investments, our carrying value at the time of any sale, the actual sales price realized, the timing of such sales, and any additional regulatory guidance or interpretations of the Volcker Rule.

If we continue to grow and our total consolidated assets reach or exceed $50 billion, we will be subject to more stringent regulations, including enhanced prudential standards, required by the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve applicable to large bank holding companies.

As of

December 31, 2016

, our total consolidated assets were

$44.7 billion

. Under the Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential standard regulations, SVB Financial would become subject to more stringent prudential standards if, whether as a result of organic growth, potential future acquisitions or otherwise, we averaged total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more at the end of a four-quarter period.  Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the more stringent prudential standards include requirements related to



risk-based and leverage capital, liquidity, risk management, resolution planning, supervisory capital stress testing, single counterparty credit exposure limits, and early remediation - all of which require appropriate resources and planning.  The Dodd-Frank Act further permits, but does not require, the Federal Reserve to apply enhanced prudential standards to large bank holding companies in other areas, including short-term debt limits and enhanced public disclosures

.

If we become subject to such enhanced prudential standards, we will face more stringent requirements or limitations on our business, as well as increased compliance costs. For example, if we are subject to CCAR, the Federal Reserve may object to, or otherwise not respond favorably to our capital plan, capital actions or stress test results, and we may be limited as to how we utilize our capital, including with respect to common stock dividends and stock repurchases. In addition, if we become subject to the Federal Reserve’s and the FDIC’s resolution planning rules requiring us to submit plans for an orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, and those agencies jointly determine that our resolution plan is not credible, and we fail to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose on SVB Financial or our subsidiaries more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations, or require the divestment of assets or operations. Further, under the modified LCR rule, we would be required to measure specified unencumbered high-quality liquid assets against our expected net cash outflows, using the methodologies prescribed by the rule.  As a result of the rule’s application, SVB Financial may be required to manage our holdings of high-quality liquid assets at levels beyond what we believe we need operationally in order to manage liquidity effectively.  Additionally, such an increase may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations since high-quality liquid assets tend to carry lower yields.

See “Business-Supervision and Regulation-Enhanced Prudential Standards,” under this Part I, Item 1, for a more detailed description of the various requirements which may become applicable to us.

We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act, other anti-money laundering and anti-bribery statutes and regulations, and U.S. economic and trade sanctions.

The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with state and federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. We also must comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and we, like other financial institutions, are subject to increased scrutiny for compliance with these requirements.  We maintain policies, procedures and systems [designed to detect and deter prohibited financing activities], however if these controls were deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including civil fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan.  In addition, any failure to effectively maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

If we were to violate, or fail to comply with, international, federal or state laws or regulations governing financial institutions, we could be subject to disciplinary action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations

or reputation.

International, federal and state banking regulators possess broad powers to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to financial institutions.  Other regulatory bodies, including the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, regulate investment advisers and broker-dealers, including our subsidiaries, SVB Asset Management and SVB Securities.  These regulations are highly complex, and if we were to violate, even if unintentionally or inadvertently, the laws and regulations governing financial institutions and broker-dealers, these regulatory authorities could take various actions against us, such as imposing restrictions on how we conduct our business, imposing higher capital and liquidity requirements, requiring us to maintain higher insurance levels, revoking necessary licenses or authorizations, imposing censures, civil money penalties or fines, issuing cease and desist or other supervisory orders, and suspending or expelling us or any of our employees from the securities business. These remedies and supervisory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.

Adverse results from litigation or governmental or regulatory investigations can impact our business practices and operating results.

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings, and may from time to time be involved in governmental or regulatory investigations and inquiries relating to matters that arise in connection with the conduct of our business.  While we have not recognized a material accrual liability for any lawsuits and claims filed or pending against us to date, the outcome of litigation



and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain and it is possible that the actual results of one or more of such matters may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved, or that judgments may be rendered, or fines or penalties assessed in matters for which we have no reserves. Further, adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that may adversely affect our operating results or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our businesses as they are presently being conducted. Moreover, even if we prevail in such actions, litigation and investigations can be costly and time-consuming, and often risks diverting the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.

From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements.  Also, our global initiatives, as well as continuing trends towards the convergence of international accounting standards, such as rules that may be adopted under the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), may result in our Company being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or outside auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition or results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in our revising or restating prior period financial statements.

Changes in legislation, regulation and government policy resulting from the 2016 U.S. presidential and congressional elections may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future.

The recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, U.S. legislation, regulation and government policy, which could potentially lead to significant changes in international legislation, regulation or government policy.  While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, changes at the local, state, federal or international level could significantly impact our business and financial condition, how we operate, the industries in which we serve or compete, or our clients.  We are currently unable to predict whether reform discussions will meaningfully change existing legislative and regulatory environments relevant for our business, or if any such changes would have a net positive or negative impact on our business.  To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on us or the industries relevant to us, including as a result of such related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our holding company, SVB Financial, relies on warrant income, investment distributions and dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its cash revenues.

SVB Financial is a holding company and is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries.  It receives most of its cash revenues from three primary funding sources: warrant income, investment distributions and, to the extent declared, cash dividends paid by its subsidiaries, primarily the Bank.  These sources generate cash which is used by SVB Financial to pay operating and borrowing costs and, to the extent authorized or declared, fund dividends to stockholders and stock repurchase programs.  Any income derived from those financial instruments is subject to a variety of factors as discussed in the “Credit Risks” portion of this “Risk Factors” section.  Moreover, various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank and certain of our nonbank subsidiaries may pay to SVB Financial. In addition, SVB Financial’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a liquidation or reorganization of any of its subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.

Anti-takeover provisions and federal laws, particularly those applicable to financial institutions, may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could prevent a merger or acquisition that may be attractive to stockholders and/or have a material adverse effect on our stock price.

As a bank holding company, we are subject to certain laws that could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.  The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, together with federal and state regulations, require that, depending on the particular circumstances, either the Federal Reserve must approve or after receiving notice, must not object to any person or entity acquiring “control” (as determined under the Federal Reserve's standards) of a bank holding company, such as SVB Financial, or a state member bank, such as the Bank.  In addition, DBO approval may be required in connection with the acquisition of control of the Bank.  Moreover, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and certain other actions we may take or have taken could delay or prevent a third-party from acquiring us, any of these laws, regulations and other provisions may prevent a merger or acquisition that would be attractive to stockholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.



Strategic, Reputational and Other Risks

Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses, or to the extent we establish internal concentration limits to mitigate such risk, lower revenues or a slow-down in growth.

Concentration of risk stemming from our focus on certain markets or segments, including those by client industry, life-cycle stage, size and geography, increases the potential for significant losses, or may result in lower revenues or slower growth, if we choose to limit growth in certain markets or segments to mitigate concentration risk.  While there may exist a great deal of diversity within each industry, our clients are concentrated within the following general industry niches: technology, life science and healthcare, private equity and venture capital and premium wine. In particular, our technology clients generally tend to be in the industries of hardware (semiconductors, communications, data storage and electronics), software and internet (such as infrastructure software, applications, software services, digital content and advertising technology), and energy and resource innovation. Our life science and healthcare clients are concentrated in the industries of biotechnology, medical devices, healthcare information technology and healthcare services.  Many of our client companies are also concentrated by certain stages within their life cycles, such as early-stage, mid-stage or later-stage and many of these companies are venture capital-backed.  We take deposits from these clients and are also continuing to increase our efforts to lend to larger clients and to make larger loans.  In addition, growth prospects and our geographic focus on key domestic and international innovation markets, as well as premium wine markets, may lead to an increase our concentration risk.  Our loan concentrations are derived from our borrowers engaging in similar activities as well as certain types of loans extended to a diverse group of borrowers that could cause those borrowers to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions.  Any adverse effect on any of our areas of concentration could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable to our competitors.

Decreases in the amount of equity capital available to our portfolio companies could adversely affect our business, growth and profitability.

Our core strategy is focused on providing banking products and services to companies, including in particular to early-stage and mid-stage companies that receive financial support from sophisticated investors, including venture capital or private equity firms, “angels,” corporate investors, crowd-funding and other evolving sources of capital.  We derive a meaningful share of our deposits from these companies and provide them with loans as well as other banking products and services. In some cases, our lending credit decision is based on our analysis of the likelihood that our client will receive additional rounds of equity capital from investors or other funding sources. Among the factors that have affected and could in the future affect the amount of capital available to our portfolio companies are the receptivity of the capital markets, the prevalence of public equity offerings or merger and acquisition activity, primarily among companies within the technology and life science/healthcare industry sectors, the availability and return on alternative investments, economic conditions in the technology, life science/healthcare and private equity/venture capital industries, and overall general economic conditions. Reduced capital markets valuations could also reduce the amount of capital available to our client companies, including companies within our technology and life science/healthcare industry sectors. If the amount of capital available to such companies decreases, it is likely that the number of our new clients and investor financial support to our existing clients could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability and growth prospects.

We face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or future growth.

We compete with other banks as well as specialty and diversified financial services companies and investment and debt funds, some of which are larger than we are and which may offer a broader range of lending, leasing, payments, foreign currency exchange, and other financial products and advisory services to our client base.  We also compete with other alternative and more specialized lenders, such as online “marketplace” lenders, peer-to-peer lenders and other non-traditional lenders that have emerged in recent years. Moreover, we compete with non-financial services, particularly payment facilitators and processors or other nonbanking technology providers in the payments industry, which may offer specialized services to our client base. In addition, we compete with hedge funds and private equity funds. Such competitors may focus their marketing efforts on industry sectors which we serve and for example, seek to increase their lending and other financial relationships with technology companies or special industries such as wineries. When new competitors seek to enter one of our markets, or when existing market participants seek to increase their market share, they sometimes undercut the pricing and/or credit terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our market share or ability to exploit new market opportunities. We may be forced to accept less attractive credit, pricing and other investment terms if we act to meet these competitive challenges, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and future growth. Similarly, competitive pressures could adversely affect the business, results of operations, financial condition or future growth of our non-banking services, including our payments services, as well as our access to capital and attractive investment opportunities for our funds business.



Our ability to maintain or increase our market share depends on our ability to attract and maintain, as well as meet the needs of, existing and future clients.

Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain or increase our market share.  In particular, much of our success depends on our ability to attract early-stage or start-up companies as clients and to retain those companies as clients as they grow and mature successfully through the various stages of their life cycles. As a result, we adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards as well as introduce new products and services beyond industry standards in order to serve our clients, who are innovators themselves.  A failure to achieve market acceptance for any new products or services we introduce, a failure to introduce products or services that the market demands, or the costs associated with developing, introducing and providing new products and services could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, growth prospects and financial condition.

We face risks in connection with our strategic undertakings and new business initiatives.

We are engaged, and may in the future engage, in strategic activities domestically or internationally, including acquisitions, joint ventures, partnerships, investments or other business growth initiatives or undertakings. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities, that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities, if undertaken, will be successful.

We are focused on our long-term growth and have undertaken various strategic activities and business initiatives, many of which involve activities that are new to us, or in some cases, are experimental in nature. For example, we are expanding our global presence and may engage in activities in jurisdictions where we have limited experience or where legal and regulatory requirements are less certain than in the United States.  We are also expanding our payments processing capabilities to better serve our clients, including innovating new electronic payment processing solutions, developing new payments technologies, and supporting new or evolving disruptive payments systems.  Given our evolving geographic and product diversification, and our innovative product solutions, these payment-related initiatives may subject us to, among other risks, increased business, reputational and operational risk, as well as more complex legal, regulatory and compliance costs and risks.

Our ability to execute strategic activities and new business initiatives successfully will depend on a variety of factors. These factors likely will vary based on the nature of the activity but may include our success in integrating an acquired company or a new internally-developed growth initiative into our business, operations, services, products, personnel and systems, operating effectively with any partner with whom we elect to do business, meeting applicable regulatory requirements and obtaining applicable regulatory licenses or other approvals, hiring or retaining key employees, achieving anticipated synergies, meeting management's expectations, actually realizing the anticipated benefits of the activities, and overall general market conditions. Our ability to address these matters successfully cannot be assured. In addition, our strategic efforts may divert resources or management's attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential liability. If we do not successfully execute a strategic undertaking, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation or growth prospects. In addition, if we were to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired, that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us, which would adversely affect our results of operations.

In addition, in order to finance future strategic undertakings, we might require additional financing, which might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If obtained, equity financing could be dilutive and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our business reputation and relationships are important and any damage to them could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our reputation is very important in sustaining our business and we rely on our relationships with our current, former and potential clients and stockholders, the venture capital and private equity communities, and other actors in the industries that we serve.  Any damage to our reputation, whether arising from regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and exchange listing requirements, negative publicity, the way in which we conduct our business or otherwise could strain our existing relationships and make it difficult for us to develop new relationships. Any such damage to our reputation and relationships could in turn lead to a material adverse effect on our business.

An ineffective risk management framework could have a material adverse effect on our strategic planning and our ability to mitigate risks and/or losses and could have adverse regulatory consequences.

We have implemented a risk management framework to identify and manage our risk exposure. This framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including,



among others, credit, market, liquidity, operational, capital, compliance, strategic and, reputational risks. Our framework also includes financial, analytical, forecasting, or other modeling methodologies, which involves management assumptions and judgment.  In addition, our Board of Directors, in consultation with management, has adopted a risk appetite statement, which sets forth certain thresholds and limits to govern our overall risk profile. However, there is no assurance that our risk management framework, including the risk metrics under our risk appetite statement, will be effective under all circumstances or that it will adequately identify, manage or mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our risk management framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and become subject to regulatory consequences, as a result of which our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we grow to total consolidated assets of $50 billion or greater, we will become subject to more stringent risk management requirements that could increase our compliance costs and require us to further enhance our risk management framework and practices.  See the section "Business-Supervision and Regulation-Enhanced Prudential Standards" under this Part I, Item 1.

We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.

Quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating probable loan losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and result of operations, and managing risk. However, all models have certain limitations. For example, our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses and correlations. These assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect the changing environment.  Further, even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design. Although we employ strategies to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models, they may not be effective or fully reliable. As a result, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we operate and ultimately cause planning failures or the reporting of incorrect information to our regulators. Any such occurrence or the perception of such occurrence by our regulators, investors or clients could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial conditions.

Our capital stress testing processes rely on analytical and forecasting models that may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate, which could adversely affect the effectiveness of our strategic planning and our ability to pursue certain corporate goals.

In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Reserve’s regulations thereunder, banking organizations with $10 billion to $50 billion in assets are required to perform annual capital stress tests.  The results of our capital stress tests may require us to increase our regulatory capital, raise additional capital or take or decline to take certain other capital-related actions under certain circumstances.  Our stress testing processes also rely on our use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, even if our assumptions are accurate predictors of future performance, the models they are based on may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or implementation. Also, the assumptions we utilize for our stress tests may not be met with regulatory approval, which could result in our stress tests receiving a failing grade. In addition to adversely affecting our reputation, failing our stress tests would likely preclude or delay the possibility of our growth through acquisition, and would limit our ability to pay any cash dividends.

We could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or the interpretations of such laws and regulations.

We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have business operations. These tax laws are complex and may be subject to different interpretations. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our valuation allowance. Changes to the tax laws, administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our provision for income taxes and reduce our net income.

In particular, U.S. tax laws and regulations may continue to change from time-to-time. While impossible to predict, governments’ need for additional revenue may lead to continued proposals to change tax rules in ways that could increase our effective tax rate. In addition, these changes could include a widening of the corporate tax base by including earnings from international operations that are not currently required to be included.  Such changes to the tax laws could have a material impact on our income tax expense.



The price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline.

The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control.  In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:

•

actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;

•

changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts;

•

failure to meet analysts’ revenue or earnings estimates;

•

speculation in the press or investment community;

•

strategic actions by us or our competitors;

•

actions by institutional stockholders;

•

fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;

•

general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;

•

market perceptions about the innovation economy, including levels of funding or "exit" activities of companies in the industries we serve;

•

proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;

•

anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us; and

•

domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.

The trading price of the shares of our common stock and the value of our other securities will further depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including, without limitation, our financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects, and future sales of our equity or equity-related securities.  In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength. A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation, as well as the loss of key employees.

Through our various subsidiaries and divisions, we offer a variety of banking and financial products and services. For more than 30 years, we have been dedicated to helping innovative companies and their investors succeed, especially in the technology, life science/healthcare, private equity/venture capital and premium wine industries. We provide our clients of all sizes and stages with a diverse set of products and services to support them through all stages of their life cycles, and key innovation markets around the world.

We offer commercial and private banking products and services through our principal subsidiary, the Bank, which is a California-state chartered bank founded in 1983 and a member of the Federal Reserve System. Through its subsidiaries, the Bank also offers, investment advisory, asset management, private wealth management and brokerage services. We also offer non-banking products and services, such as funds management, venture capital and private equity investment, and business valuation services, through our subsidiaries and divisions.



Management’s Overview of


Financial Performance

Overall, we had a strong year in


, despite lower gains from our equity warrants and private equity and venture capital investments as a result of the slowdown in IPO's and overall softening in the venture capital-backed exit markets, primarily during the first half of the year.  Our strong performance is reflective of healthy loan growth, credit quality that remained sound overall despite higher levels of net loan charge-offs, and strong growth in core fee income. Our core business continues to perform well as a result of our ongoing focus on innovation companies and their investors and continued efforts to secure client relationships. We saw continued success in working with private equity/venture capital firms as well as growth of our private bank offerings to private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders of the innovation companies they support.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. We have identified four policies as being critical because they require us to make particularly difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and we base these estimates on historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Our critical accounting policies include those that address the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded credit commitments, measurements of fair value, the valuation of equity warrant assets and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. Our senior management has discussed and reviewed the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

We disclose our method and approach for each of our critical accounting policies in

Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

.

Allowance for Loan Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Credit Commitments

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. We consider our accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses to be critical as estimation of the allowance involves material estimates by us and is particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term. Determining the allowance for loan losses requires us to make forecasts that are highly uncertain and require a high degree of judgment. Our loan loss reserve methodology is applied to our loan portfolio and we maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels that we believe are appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. A committee comprised of senior management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.

Our allowance for loan losses is established for loan losses that are probable and incurred but not yet realized. The process of anticipating loan losses is inherently imprecise. We apply a systematic process for the evaluation of individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses. At the time of approval each loan in our portfolio is assigned a credit risk rating through an evaluation process, which includes consideration of such factors as payment status, the financial condition of the borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral values, potential loan concentrations, and general economic conditions. The credit risk ratings for each loan are monitored and updated on an ongoing basis.

The allowance for loan losses is based on a formula allocation for similarly risk-rated loans by client industry sector and individually for impaired loans. Our formula allocation is determined on a quarterly basis by utilizing a historical loan loss migration model, which is a statistical model used to estimate an appropriate allowance for outstanding loan balances by calculating the likelihood of a loan being charged-off based on its credit risk rating using historical loan performance data from our portfolio. The formula allocation provides the average loan loss experience for each portfolio segment, which considers our quarterly historical loss experience since the year 2000, both by risk-rating category and client industry sector. The resulting loan loss factors for each risk-rating category and client industry sector are ultimately applied to the respective period-end client loan balances for each corresponding risk-rating category by client industry sector to provide an estimation of the allowance for loan losses.

We also supplement our allowance by applying qualitative allocations to the results we obtained through our historical loan loss migration model to ascertain the total allowance for loan losses. These qualitative allocations are based upon management's assessment of the risks that may lead to a loan loss experience different from our historical loan loss experience. These risks are aggregated to become our qualitative allocation. Refer to

Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

for a summary of the factors management considers for its qualitative allocation as part of management's estimate of the changing risks in the lending environment. In 2016, we made certain enhancements to factors included in our qualitative allocation. We changed from a total loan portfolio weighted average loss factor to a portfolio segment specific loss factor for our estimated reserve floor for portfolio segments that would not draw a minimum reserve based on the lack of historical loan loss experience. Additionally, in response to increased average borrowing amounts by our clients, we increased our definition of a large loan used for our qualitative reserve for large funded loan exposure. These enhancements were applied during the fourth quarter of 2016 and decreased our qualitative



allowance by $7.9 million, net. The net decrease was primarily due to the application of a lower loss factor for our private equity/venture capital loan portfolio.

Reserve for Unfunded Credit Commitments

The reserve for unfunded credit commitments is determined using a methodology that is inherently similar to the methodology used for calculating the allowance for loan losses adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at funding. We consider our accounting policy for the reserve for unfunded credit commitments to be critical as estimation of the reserve involves material estimates by management and is susceptible to changes in the near term. The reserve for unfunded credit commitments equals management’s best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.

In 2016, we made certain enhancements to our methodology for the reserve for unfunded loan commitments by applying segment specific historical loss experience for our funded loan portfolio and segment specific probability of funding factors to estimate the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Historically, we used blended results at the overall portfolio level for both historical loss experience and funding probability. These enhancements were applied during the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased our reserve for unfunded credit commitments by $8.1 million, net. The increase was primarily due to higher loss and probability of funding factors for our software and internet and hardware loan portfolios, partially offset by lower loss factors for our private equity/venture capital loan portfolio. The reserve for unfunded credit commitments also includes certain qualitative allocations as deemed appropriate by management.

Fair Value Measurements

We use fair value measurements to record fair value for certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. We disclose our method and approach for fair value measurements of assets and liabilities in

Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

.

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable and the significance of the level of the input to the entire measurement. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. The three levels for measuring fair value are defined in

Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

.

The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value (Level 1 measurements). When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. For inactive markets, there is little information, if any, to evaluate if individual transactions are orderly. Accordingly, we are required to estimate, based upon all available facts and circumstances, the degree to which orderly transactions are occurring and provide more weighting to price quotes that are based upon orderly transactions (Level 2 measurements). In addition, changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement (Level 3 measurements). Significant judgment is required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are included in Level 2 or Level 3. When making this judgment, we consider available information and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. The classification of Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instrument's fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greater for financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3.



The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the amounts measured using significant Level 3 inputs at

December 31, 2016

and


:

Financial assets valued using Level 3 measurements consist of our non-marketable securities (investments in venture capital and other investment securities in shares of public company stock subject to certain sales restrictions for which the sales restriction has not been lifted) and equity warrant assets (rights to shares of private and public company capital stock). The valuation techniques of our non-marketable securities carried under fair value accounting and equity warrant assets involve a significant degree of management judgment. Refer to

Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

for a summary of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used for each class of Level 3 assets.

The inherent uncertainty in the process of valuing securities for which a ready market does not exist may cause our estimated values of these securities to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences could be material. The timing and amount of changes in fair value, if any, of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying companies, fluctuations in the market prices of the preferred or common stock of the underlying companies, general volatility and interest rate market factors, and legal and contractual restrictions. The timing and amount of actual net proceeds, if any, from the disposition of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including investor demand for IPOs, levels of M&A activity, legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell, and the perceived and actual performance of portfolio companies. All of these factors are difficult to predict and there can be no assurances that we will realize the full value of these securities, which could result in significant losses. (See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of Part I above)

During


, the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of

$38.1 million

(which is inclusive of noncontrolling interest), primarily due to gains on exercised warrant assets. During


and


, the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of

$72.6 million

and

$188.2 million

(which is inclusive of noncontrolling interest), respectively.

Derivative Assets-Equity Warrant Assets

As discussed above, the valuation of our equity warrant assets is a Level 3 measurement, which requires a significant degree of management judgment in order to value the assets. Our equity warrant asset policy is also considered a critical policy due to the variability of returns from our shares of private and public companies and due to the degree of management judgment in selecting a valuation technique for our equity warrant assets.

The timing and value realized from the disposition of equity warrant assets depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying portfolio companies, investor demand for IPOs, fluctuations in the price of the underlying common stock of these private and public companies, levels of M&A activity, and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities. All of these factors are difficult to predict. Many equity warrant assets may be terminated or may expire without compensation and may incur valuation losses from lower-priced funding rounds. We are unable to predict future gains or losses with accuracy, and gains or losses could vary materially from period to period.

Additionally, while management has selected the valuation methodology that it believes provides the best estimate of fair value, there are several acceptable valuation techniques as well as alternative approaches for the calculation of significant inputs for the valuation technique. In the event that a different valuation technique or approach for calculating a significant input were to be used, then the estimated values of these assets could differ significantly from the existing values recorded. Further, the inherent uncertainty of valuing assets for which a ready market is unavailable may cause our estimated values of these assets to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the assets existed, and those differences could be material and ultimately, the recorded fair value of equity warrant assets may never be realized, which could result in significant losses.



Income Taxes

We are subject to income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax-basis carrying amount. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided when management assesses available evidence and exercises their judgment that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

We consider our accounting policy relating to income taxes to be critical as the determination of current and deferred income taxes is based on analyses of many factors including interpretation of federal, state and foreign income tax laws, the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities (temporary differences), estimates of amounts due or owed, the timing of reversals of temporary differences and current financial accounting standards. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates due to tax law interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities. Additionally, there can be no assurances that estimates and interpretations used in determining income tax liabilities may not be challenged by federal and state taxing authorities.

In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740,

Income Taxes.

We believe that our unrecognized tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, are adequate in relation to the potential for additional tax assessments.

We are also subject to routine corporate tax audits by the various tax jurisdictions. In the preparation of income tax returns, tax positions are taken based on interpretation of federal and state income tax laws as well as foreign tax laws. We review our uncertain tax positions quarterly, and we may adjust these unrecognized tax benefits in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Income and Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

Net interest income is defined as the difference between interest earned from loans, our fixed income investment portfolio (available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities) and our short-term investment securities and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest margin is defined as net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis to consistently reflect income from taxable loans and securities and tax-exempt securities based on the federal statutory tax rate of 35.0 percent.

Analysis of Net Interest Income Changes Due to Volume and Rate (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “volume change.” Net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “rate change.” The following table sets forth changes in interest income for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest expense for each major category of interest-bearing liabilities. The table also reflects the amount of simultaneous changes attributable to both volume and rate changes for the years indicated. For this table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and average rate.

The decrease in loan portfolio yield was reflective of a continued shift in the mix of our overall loan portfolio as well as lower loan fees, partially offset by the 25 basis point increase in the target federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve in December 2015. Our loan growth in 2016 came primarily from our private equity/venture capital and Private Bank loan portfolios which, on average, tend to have higher credit quality, but lower loan yields. Our yields were also impacted by increased price competition.

◦

A

$1.3 million

increase in interest income from our fixed income investment securities to

in


with the increase due to an $11.7 million decrease in premium amortization expense, net, as a result of new investment purchases at a net discount and lower prepayment estimates following the increase in market interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2016. This was mostly offset by lower interest income as a result of a decrease in average fixed income investment securities of $0.7 billion as a result of our sales of investment securities during the first and second quarters of 2016 to fund loans and repay short-term borrowings. Our overall yields from investment securities increased six basis points to 1.63 percent, primarily attributable to the change in premium amortization.

◦

A

A $72.9 million increase in interest income from our fixed income investment securities to $349.1 million in 2015, compared to $276.2 million in 2014 with the majority of the increase due to a $5.7 billion increase in average balances due to strong deposit growth. Interest income was offset by a decrease in the overall yield on our fixed income investment securities portfolio, which decreased nine basis points to 1.57 percent. Lower reinvestment yields, reflective of an increase in our purchases of U.S. Treasury securities in 2015, contributed to a 16 basis point decrease in gross yields.  The decrease in the gross fixed income investment portfolio yield was partially offset by a seven basis point benefit from lower premium amortization expense, driven by lower prepayments.

•

Interest expense

for 2015 increased to $40.3 million, compared to $35.3 million for 2014, due primarily to:

◦

An $11.6 million increase in interest expense related to our long-term debt, reflective of the $350 million issuance of our 3.50% Senior Notes in late January 2015.

◦

A $5.7 million decrease in interest paid on our interest-bearing money market deposits as a result of market rate adjustments.

Net Interest Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

Our net interest margin increased by

2.72 percent

in


, compared to

2.57 percent

in


and

2.81 percent

in


.


compared to


The increase in our net interest margin in 2016 was reflective primarily of a shift in the mix of average interest-earning assets towards our higher yielding loan portfolio as a result of our sales of investment securities during the first and second quarters of 2016 to fund loans and repay short-term borrowings. At December 31, 2016, our loan portfolio comprised

43 percent

of our average interest-earning assets an increase from

38 percent

for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our net interest margin also increased as a result of the 25 basis point increase in the target federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve in December 2015.

2015 compared to 2014

The decrease in our net interest margin in 2015 was primarily reflective of the continued growth of our average deposits of $8.0 billion.  A majority of the increased deposit funds were deployed into our fixed income investment portfolio, in addition



to funding our loan portfolio; both of which saw a decrease in yields during 2015 as mentioned above. The lower overall fixed income investment yield is primarily reflective of the increase in our purchases of U.S. Treasury securities in 2015. Our fixed income investment portfolio (lower-yielding assets) comprised 57 percent and 54 percent of our average interest-earning assets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The lower overall loan portfolio yield resulted largely from the continued shift in the mix of our loan portfolio due to strong growth in our, typically, higher quality, lower yielding, private equity/venture capital loan portfolio. The decrease in our loan portfolio yield also continued to reflect the overall low market rate environment and continued price competition in the marketplace. Our loan portfolio (higher-yielding assets) comprised 38 percent of our average interest-earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2015, consistent with 2014.



Average Balances, Yields and Rates Paid (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

The average yield earned on interest-earning assets is the amount of annualized fully taxable equivalent interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The average rate paid on funding sources is the amount of annualized interest expense expressed as a percentage of average funding sources. The following tables set forth average assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and SVBFG stockholders’ equity, interest income, interest expense, annualized yields and rates, and the composition of our annualized net interest margin in

Reflects foreign currency translation adjustments within the allowance for loan losses.  Prior period amounts were previously reported with loan recoveries and have been revised to conform to current period presentation.

Our provision for loan losses is a function of our reserve methodology, which is used to determine an appropriate allowance for loan losses for the period. Our reserve methodology is based on our evaluation of the existing allowance for loan losses in relation to total gross loans using historical and other objective information, and on our qualitative assessment of the inherent and identified credit risk of the loan portfolio. For a more detailed discussion of credit quality and the allowance for loan losses, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above, “Consolidated Financial Condition-Credit Quality and the Allowance for Loan Losses” below and

Note 9—"Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

was reflective primarily of $37.9 million for charge-offs that did not previously have a specific reserve, $30.9 million for specific reserves on new nonaccrual loans, $29.5 million for period-end loan growth of

$3.2 billion

, partially offset by a $7.9 million decrease due to enhancements to our loan loss reserve methodology during the fourth quarter of 2016 as discussed in our "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates".

2015 compared to 2014

We had a provision for loan losses of

$97.6 million

in


, compared to a provision of

$59.5 million

in


. The provision of

$97.6 million

in


was driven primarily by net charge-offs of $43.9 million, a $36.8 million increase in the reserve for nonaccrual loans and an additional reserve of $21.6 million for period-end loan growth of $2.4 billion, offset by a reserve release of $4.6 million due to the improvement of the credit quality of our overall loan portfolio. Gross loan charge-offs were $51.0 million, of which $33.3 million came from our software and internet loan portfolio.



Noninterest Income

For the year ended December 31, 2016, noninterest income was

$456.6 million

, compared to

$472.8 million

and

$572.2 million

, for the comparable 2015 and 2014 periods. For the year ended December 31, 2016, non-GAAP noninterest income, net of noncontrolling interests was

$448.5 million

, compared to

$441.1 million

and

$352.5 million

, for the comparable 2015 and 2014 periods. For the year ended December 31, 2016, non-GAAP core fee income was

$316.2 million

, compared to

$265.4 million

and

$209.6 million

for the comparable 2015 and 2014 periods. (See reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used below under "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures".)

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our audited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance (including, but not limited to, non-GAAP core fee income, non-GAAP noninterest income and non-GAAP net gains on investment securities). These supplemental performance measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by GAAP or other applicable requirement.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding items that represent income attributable to investors other than us and our subsidiaries and other certain non-recurring items. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Included in noninterest income is income and expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. We recognize, as part of our investment funds management business through SVB Capital, the entire income or loss from funds consolidated in accordance with ASC Topic 810 as discussed in

Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

. We are required under GAAP to consolidate 100% of the results of these entities, even though we may own less than 100% of such entities. The relevant amounts attributable to investors other than us are reflected under “Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests” on our statements of income. Where applicable, the tables below for noninterest income and net gains on investment securities exclude noncontrolling interests and net losses on the SVBIF sale transaction.

Core fee income is a non-GAAP financial measure, which represents GAAP noninterest income, but excludes certain line items where performance is typically subject to market or other conditions beyond our control. Core fee income includes foreign exchange fees, deposit service charges, credit card fees, lending related fees, client investment fees and letters of credit fees.

Gains on Investment Securities, Net

Net gains on investment securities include both gains and losses from our non-marketable and other securities, as well as gains and losses from sales of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, when applicable.

Our available-for-sale securities portfolio is primarily a fixed income investment portfolio that is managed with the objective of earning an appropriate portfolio yield over the long-term while maintaining sufficient liquidity and credit diversification as well as addressing our asset/liability management objectives. Sales of equity securities held as a result of our exercised warrants, result in net gains or losses on investment securities. These sales are conducted pursuant to the guidelines of our investment policy related to the management of our liquidity position and interest rate risk. Though infrequent, sales of fixed-income investment securities in our AFS securities portfolio may result in net gains or losses and are also conducted pursuant to the guidelines of our investment policy.

Our non-marketable and other securities portfolio primarily represents investments in venture capital and private equity funds, our China Joint Venture, debt funds, private and public portfolio companies and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. We experience variability in the performance of our non-marketable and other securities from period to period, which results in net gains or losses on investment securities (both realized and unrealized). This variability is due to a number of factors, including unrealized changes in the values of our investments, changes in the amount of realized gains from distributions, changes in liquidity events and general economic and market conditions. Unrealized gains from non-marketable and other securities for any single period are typically driven by valuation changes, and are therefore subject to potential increases or decreases in future periods. Such variability may lead to volatility in the gains or losses from investment securities. As such, our results for a particular period are not necessarily indicative of our expected performance in a future period.

The extent to which any unrealized gains or losses will become realized is subject to a variety of factors, including, among other things, the expiration of certain sales restrictions to which these equity securities may be subject to (i.e. lock-up agreements), changes in prevailing market prices, market conditions, the actual sales or distributions of securities, the timing of such actual sales or distributions, which, to the extent such securities are managed by our managed funds, are subject to our funds' separate discretionary sales/distributions and governance processes.

In


, we had net gains on investment securities of

$51.7 million

, compared to

$89.4 million

and

$267.0 million

in


and


, respectively.  Non-GAAP net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests were

$43.4 million

in


, compared to

$57.3 million

in


. The decrease in net gains on investment securities for 2016 compared to 2015 was reflective of a slowdown in IPO's and overall softness in the venture capital-backed exit markets, primarily during the first half of 2016, which drove lower warrant and venture capital-related gains.  Net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests of

$43.4 million

in


were driven by the following:

•

Gains of

$28.6 million

from our strategic and other investments, primarily driven by continued distributions from our strategic venture capital fund investments reflective of IPO and M&A activity as well as unrealized valuation increases from certain investments due to market activity,



•

Gains of

$12.2 million

from our available-for-sale securities portfolio, primarily reflective of $13.8 million of net gains on the sale of approximately $2.9 billion in U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by $1.6 million of net losses on sales of shares from exercised warrants in public companies upon expiration of lock-up periods during 2016, and

•

Gains of

$1.9 million

from our managed funds of funds, primarily related to unrealized valuation increases.

In 2015, we had net gains on investment securities of $89.4 million, compared to $267.0 million in 2014.  Non-GAAP net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests were $57.3 million in 2015, compared to $30.7 million in 2014. Net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests of $57.3 million in 2015 were driven by the following:

•

Gains of $30.2 million from our strategic and other investments, primarily driven by strong distributions from our strategic venture capital fund investments reflective of IPO and M&A activity as well as unrealized valuation increases from certain investments,

•

Gains of $17.0 million from our managed funds of funds, primarily related to unrealized valuation increases, and

•

Gains of $5.6 million from our managed direct venture funds, primarily related to realized gains from distributions on investments, including the remaining shares of FireEye, Inc. ("FireEye"), as well as unrealized valuation increases.

in


, compared to

$83.8 million

in


and

$96.8 million

in


. Net gains on derivative instruments of

$48.6 million

in 2016 were primarily due to the following:

•

Net gains on equity warrant assets of

$37.9 million

in


, due primarily to

$31.2 million

from the exercise of equity warrant assets, reflective of IPO and M&A activity, and warrant valuation increases of

$9.7 million

driven by changes in valuations from our private company warrant portfolio.

•

Net gains of

$16.1 million

on internal foreign exchange forward contracts hedging certain of our foreign currency denominated instruments in 2016. The

$16.1 million

of gains were primarily attributable to the continued appreciation of the U.S. Dollar during 2016. These gains were offset by losses of

$16.7 million

from the revaluation of foreign currency denominated instruments, which are included in the line item "Other" within noninterest income as noted below.



Gains on derivative instruments, net, of

$83.8 million

in


were primarily due to the following:

•

Net gains on equity warrant assets of

$71.0 million

in


, due primarily to

$41.5 million

from the exercise of equity warrant assets, reflective of the exercise and conversion of several of our public warrants, and from warrant valuation increases of

$30.5 million

driven by changes in valuations from our private company warrant portfolio.

•

Net gains of

$12.4 million

on internal foreign exchange forward contracts hedging certain of our foreign currency denominated instruments in 2015. The

$12.4 million

of gains were attributable primarily to the continued appreciation of the U.S. Dollar during 2015. These gains were offset by losses of

$12.7 million

from the revaluation of foreign currency denominated instruments which are included in the line item "Other" within noninterest income as noted below.

Non-GAAP Core Fee Income

(1)

This non-GAAP measure represents noninterest income, but excludes certain line items where performance is typically subject to market or other conditions beyond our control. See "Use of Non-GAAP Measures" above.

Foreign Exchange Fees

Foreign exchange fees were

$104.2 million

in


, compared to

$87.0 million

and

$71.7 million

in


and


, respectively. The increases in foreign exchange fees were due primarily to the increase in the number of clients actively managing currency exposure as a result of the recent volatility in the currency markets following the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the European Union ("Brexit"). For the year ended December 31, 2016, a one-time reclassification of $2.9 million in foreign exchange fee income from noninterest income gains on derivative instruments also contributed to the increase.

Credit Card Fees

Credit card fees were

$68.2 million

in


, compared to

$56.7 million

and

$41.8 million

in


and


, respectively. The increases reflect increased client utilization of our credit card products and custom payment solutions provided to new and existing clients. The increases were partially offset by higher rebate/rewards expense.

Deposit Service Charges

Deposit service charges were

$52.5 million

in


, compared to

$46.7 million

and

$39.9 million

in


and


, respectively. The increases were reflective of the increase in the number of deposit clients as well as increases in transaction volumes.

Lending Related Fees

Lending related fees were

$33.4 million

in


, compared to

$32.5 million

and

$25.7 million

in


and


, respectively. The increases were primarily due to increases in unused commitment fees. Unused loan commitments were

$15.0 billion

at December 31, 2016, $14.1 billion at December 31, 2015 and $13.5 billion at December 31, 2014.

Client Investment Fees

We offer a variety of investment products on which we earn fees. These products include money market mutual funds, overnight repurchase agreements and sweep money market funds available through the Bank; client-directed accounts offered



through SVB Securities, our broker dealer subsidiary, or fixed income management services offered through SVB Asset Management, our investment advisory subsidiary.

Client investment fees were

$32.2 million

in


, compared to

$21.6 million

and

$14.9 million

in


and


, respectively. The increases were reflective of an increase in average client investment funds driven by our clients’ increased utilization of our off-balance sheet products managed by SVB Asset Management and our cash sweep product as well as from money fund rate increases across our off-balance sheet client investment fund platforms during the first quarter of 2016.

in


, compared to income of

$34.2 million

in


and a loss of

$1.3 million

in


. The increase of $5.9 million in other noninterest income from


to


was due to the following:

•

Fund management fees of

$19.2 million

as compared to fees of

$15.9 million

for the comparable 2015 period. The increase was due primarily to the addition of new managed funds at SVB Capital.

•

Other noninterest income increased $3.3 million primarily due to an increase in carried interest income and other fee income partially offset by decreases in correspondent bank rebate income and FHLB/FRB stock dividend income.

The increase of $35.5 million in 2015 was due to the following:

•

2014 included pre-tax net losses of $13.9 million related to the sale of SVBIF.

•

Losses of $12.7 million from the revaluation of foreign currency instruments, compared to losses of $21.6 million in 2014. The revaluation losses of $12.7 million were primarily attributable to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar during 2015 and were partially offset by net gains of $12.4 million for 2015 on internal foreign exchange forward contracts economically hedging certain of these instruments, which are included within noninterest income in the line item "gains on derivative instruments" as noted above.



Noninterest Expense

Included in noninterest expense is expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. See below for a description and reconciliation of non-GAAP noninterest expense and non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio, both of which exclude noncontrolling interests.

Non-GAAP Noninterest Expense

We use and report non-GAAP noninterest expense, non-GAAP taxable equivalent revenue and non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio, which excludes noncontrolling interests. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by: (i) excluding certain items that represent expenses attributable to investors other than us and our subsidiaries, or certain items that do not occur every reporting period; or (ii) providing additional information used by management that is not otherwise required by GAAP or other applicable requirements. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The table below provides a summary of non-GAAP noninterest expense and non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio, both net of noncontrolling interests and excluding net losses on the SVBIF sale transaction:

Compensation and Benefits Expense

The following table provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense:

(1)

Other employee compensation and benefits includes employer payroll taxes, group health and life insurance, share-based compensation, 401(k), warrant incentive and retention program plans, agency fees and other employee related expenses.

Compensation and benefits expense was

$514.3 million

in


, compared to

$473.8 million

in


and

$409.5 million

in


. The key factors driving the increase in compensation and benefits expense in 2016 were as follows:

•

An increase of

$30.2 million

in salaries and wages expense, primarily due to an increase in the number of average FTEs. Average FTEs increased by


to

2,225

in


, compared to

2,004

in


, primarily to support our product development, operations, sales and advisory functions, as well as to support our commercial banking initiatives.



•

An increase of

$18.1 million

in other employee compensation and benefits, primarily due to higher agency fees, group health and life insurance expenses and share-based plan expenses.

•

A decrease of

$5.4 million

in ESOP expense, based on higher expenses in 2015 reflective of our strong 2015 performance.

The increase in compensation and benefits expense of $64.3 million in


as compared to 2014 was due primarily to the following:

•

An increase of $27.5 million in salaries and wages expense, primarily due to an increase in the number of average FTEs. Average FTEs increased by 189 to 2,004 in 2015, compared to 1,815 in 2014, primarily to support our product development, operations, sales and advisory functions, as well as to support our commercial banking initiatives.

•

An increase of $23.0 million in incentive compensation and ESOP expense, primarily reflective of the increase in average FTEs eligible for our Incentive Compensation Plan and ESOP, and stronger financial performance compared to 2014.

•

An increase of $13.8 million in other employee compensation and benefits, primarily due to an increase of $5.2 million in the Warrant Incentive Plan expense resulting from an increase in realized gains recorded on our equity warrant assets during the year. The remaining increases related to various other employee benefits, particularly employer payroll taxes, 401(k) expenses, and share-based plan expenses, which in total, contributed to an $8.6 million increase compared to 2014, primarily reflective of the increase in average FTEs noted above.

Our variable compensation plans primarily consist of our Incentive Compensation Plan, Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan, 401(k) and ESOP Plan, Retention Program and Warrant Incentive Plan. Total costs incurred under these plans were $145.3 million in


, compared to

$155.5 million

in


and

$94.4 million

in


. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to increases in consulting expenses for regulatory compliance initiatives. Included in professional service expense in 2014, were management fee expenses of $12.8 million relating to our SVB Capital business, of which $12.0 million were associated with our deconsolidated VIEs upon adoption of ASU 2015-02 (which amends the consolidation requirement for certain legal entities - See

Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

for additional details), contributing to the decrease in professional services expense for 2015.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment expense was $65.5 million in 2016, compared to $51.9 million in 2015 and $49.7 million in 2014. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to increased spending to enhance and maintain our IT infrastructure and support our overall growth.

Net Occupancy

Net occupancy expense was

$39.9 million

in


, compared to

$34.7 million

in


and

$30.0 million

in


. The increases were primarily due to lease renewals at higher costs, reflective of market conditions, and the expansion of certain offices, primarily our UK office, to support our growth.

FDIC and State Assessments

FDIC and state assessments expense was

$30.3 million

in


, compared to

$25.5 million

in


and

$19.2 million

in


. The increases were due primarily to the increase in our average assets as well as an increase in the federal assessment rate structure in 2016.

Provision for (Reduction of) Unfunded Credit Commitments

We recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of

$11.0 million

in


, compared to a reduction of our reserve for unfunded credit commitments of

$1.9 million

in


and a provision for unfunded credit commitments of

$6.5 million

in


. Our provision for unfunded credit commitments in


primarily was a result of enhancements in factors used to estimate in our reserve for unfunded credit commitments. These enhancements were applied during the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased our reserve for unfunded credit commitments by $8.1 million, net. The increase was primarily due to higher loss and



conversion factors for our software and internet and hardware loan portfolios, partially offset by lower loss factors for our private equity/venture capital loan portfolio.

Our reserve decreased in 2015, due primarily to a change in the composition of our unfunded credit commitment portfolio, which resulted in a decrease in the reserve rate. The decrease was partially offset by growth in total loan commitments available for funding and commercial and standby letters of credit, which increased by $0.9 billion to $15.6 billion in 2015 from $14.7 billion in 2014.

Other Noninterest Expense

A summary of other noninterest expense for


,


and


is as follows:

Other noninterest expense was $62.2 million in 2016 compared to $58.3 million in 2015 and $44.7 million in 2014. The increase was due primarily to an increase in lending and other client related processing costs as a result of the growth of our credit card and payment product offerings.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

Included in net income is income and expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. The relevant amounts allocated to investors in our consolidated subsidiaries, other than us, are reflected under “Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests” on our statements of income.

In the table below, noninterest income consists primarily of investment gains and losses from our consolidated funds. Noninterest expense is primarily related to management fees paid by our managed funds to SVB Financial's subsidiaries as the funds’ general partners. A summary of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for


,


and


is as follows:

NM—Not meaningful

(1)

Represents noncontrolling interests’ share in net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense.

(2)

Represents the preferred allocation of income (or change in income) earned by us as the general partner of certain consolidated funds.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was

$7.6 million

in 2016, compared to

$30.9 million

in 2015. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of

$7.6 million

for 2016 was primarily a result of the following:

•

Net gains on investment securities (including carried interest) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $8.3 million ($5.7 million excluding carried interest) primarily from gains of $8.2 million from our managed funds of funds primarily due to unrealized valuation increases. See "Results of Operations—Noninterest Income—Gains on Investment Securities, Net", and

•

Noninterest expense of

$0.5 million

, primarily related to management fees paid by the noncontrolling interests to our subsidiaries that serve as the general partner.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $30.9 million in 2015, compared to $214.8 million in 2014. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $30.9 million for 2015 was primarily a result of the following:



•

Net gains on investment securities (including carried interest) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $32.1 million ($28.0  million excluding carried interest) primarily from gains of $23.8 million from our managed funds of funds due to unrealized valuation increases and $8.3 million from our managed direct venture funds. See "Results of Operations—Noninterest Income—Gains on Investment Securities, Net", and

•

Noninterest expense of $0.8 million, related to management fees paid by the noncontrolling interests to our subsidiaries that serve as the general partner.

The overall decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily reflective of the adoption of ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2015 in which we deconsolidated 16 entities. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $214.8 million in 2014 and was primarily a result of the following:

•

Net gains on investment securities attributable to noncontrolling interests of $243.3 million reflective of gains of $239.6 million from our managed funds of funds due to unrealized valuation increases from IPO and M&A activity and other valuation increases across the portfolio, partially offset by losses of $3.3 million from our managed direct venture funds. See "Results of Operations—Noninterest Income—Gains on Investment Securities, Net", and

•

Noninterest expense of $18.9 million, primarily related to management fees paid by the noncontrolling interests to our subsidiaries that serve as the general partner.

Income Taxes

Our effective income tax expense rate was

39.5 percent

in


, compared to

39.9 percent

in


and

41.0 percent

in


.

The components of our tax rate as discussed in

Note 15—"Income Taxes" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

were consistent for the 2016, 2015, and 2014 periods. The decrease in our 2016 effective tax rate from the comparable 2015 rate was primarily attributable to a review of and adjustments made to our deferred tax balances recorded during the period as well as an increase in the recognition of tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards related to a previously disposed business line. The decrease in our 2015 effective tax rate from the comparable 2014 rate was primarily attributable to the recognition of tax benefits during 2015 from net operating loss carryforwards related to a previously disposed business line.

Our effective tax rate is calculated by dividing income tax expense by the sum of income before income tax expense and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Operating Segment Results

We have three segments for which we report our financial information: Global Commercial Bank, SVB Private Bank and SVB Capital.

We report segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reporting segments. Refer to

Note 21—"Segment Reporting" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

for additional details.

The following is our reportable segment information for


,


and


:



Global Commercial Bank

Income before income tax expense from our Global Commercial Bank (“GCB”) increased to

$636.5 million

in 2016, compared to

$454.4 million

in


and

$374.8 million

in


, which reflected the continued growth of our core commercial business and clients. The key components of GCB's performance are discussed below:


compared to


Net interest income from GCB increased by

$186.8 million

in


, due primarily to a

$126.6 million

increase in loan interest income resulting mainly from an increase in average loan balances, partially offset by lower loan yields.

Noninterest income increased by

$47.6 million

in


, related primarily to an increase in our core fees (higher foreign exchange fees, credit card fees and lending related fees). The increase in foreign exchange fees was due primarily to an increase in our client count as well as volume related to increased market volatility. The increase in credit card fees was primarily reflective of increased client utilization of our credit card products and custom payment solutions provided to new and existing clients, partially offset by higher rebate/rewards expense. The increase in lending related fees was due primarily to an increase in unused commitment fees associated with an increase in unfunded credit commitments.

Noninterest expense increased by

$53.3 million

in


, due primarily to increased expenses for compensation and benefits, premises and equipment and net occupancy. Compensation and benefits expenses increased as a result of higher salaries and wages expenses. The increase in GCB salaries and wages expenses was due primarily to an increase in the average number of FTEs at GCB, which increased by 169 to 1,793 FTEs in 2016, compared to 1,624 FTEs in 2015. Premises and equipment expense increased due to increased spending to enhance and maintain our IT infrastructure. Net occupancy expenses increased due primarily to lease renewals at higher costs, reflective of market conditions, and the expansion of certain offices, primarily our UK office, to support our growth.


compared to


Net interest income from GCB increased by $111.6 million in


, primarily due to a $71.5 million increase in loan interest income resulting mainly from an increase in average loan balances, partially offset by lower loan yields.

GCB had a provision for loan losses of

$94.9 million

in


, compared to

$58.6 million

in 2014. The provision was higher in 2015 as a result of the increase to our nonaccrual balance, which resulted in a $36.8 million increase to our allowance for nonaccrual loans.

Noninterest income increased by $69.4 million in


, due primarily to higher foreign exchange fees and credit card fees. The increase in foreign exchange fees was primarily due to increased utilization of foreign currency products by our clients, resulting in an increase in the number of trades and commissioned notional volumes. The increase in credit card fees reflects increased client utilization of our credit card products and custom payment solutions by new and existing clients. Also, noninterest income in 2014 included the $13.9 million loss from the impact of the held-for-sale classification of SVBIF.

Noninterest expense increased by $65.2 million in


, due primarily to an increase in salaries and wages and FDIC and state assessments. The increase in salaries and wages was due primarily to an increase in the average number of FTEs for GCB, which increased by


to

1,624

in


, compared to

1,482

in 2014 as well as an increase in incentive compensation reflective of stronger financial performance for the current year compared to prior year. The increase in FDIC and state assessments was due to the increase in average assets.



SVB Private Bank

NM—Not meaningful

Income before income tax expense from SVB Private Bank increased to

$42.1 million

in


, compared to

$31.5 million

in


and

$20.8 million

in


. The key drivers of SVB Private Bank's performance are discussed below:


compared to


Net interest income increased by

$9.2 million

in


, due primarily to an increase in loan interest income from an increase in average loan balances.

Noninterest income increased by $0.7 million in


, primarily driven by increased client investment fee income related to the continued growth of our Wealth Advisory practice.


compared to


Net interest income increased by

$13.0 million

in


, due primarily to a $10.5 million increase in loan interest income from an increase in average loan balances, partially offset by a decrease in the overall yield on our Private Bank loan portfolio, reflective of the low interest rate environment.

We had a provision for loan losses from SVB Private Bank of $2.7 million in 2015, primarily due to period-end loan growth. The provision for loan losses of $0.9 million in 2014 was primarily due to period-end loan growth.

Noninterest income increased by $0.5 million in


, primarily driven by increased credit card fees as a result of increased utilization of our credit card products by new and existing clients.

Noninterest expense increased by

$0.9 million

in


, primarily driven by expenses related to the continued growth of our Wealth Advisory practice.

SVB Capital

NM—Not meaningful

SVB Capital’s components of noninterest income primarily include net gains and losses on non-marketable and other securities, carried interest and fund management fees. All components of income before income tax expense discussed below are net of noncontrolling interests.



We experience variability in the performance of SVB Capital from period to period due to a number of factors, including changes in the values of our funds’ underlying investments, changes in the amount of distributions and general economic and market conditions. Such variability may lead to volatility in the gains and losses from investment securities and cause our results to differ from period to period.

Income before income tax expense from SVB Capital was

$33.8 million

in 2016, compared to

$56.2 million

in 2015 and

$45.4 million

in 2014. The key drivers of SVB Capital's performance are discussed below:


compared to


Noninterest income decreased

$21.5 million

to

$49.4 million

in


reflective of a slowdown in IPO's and overall softness in the venture capital-backed exit markets, primarily during the first half of 2016, which drove lower venture capital-related gains. SVB Capital’s components of noninterest income primarily include the following:

•

Net gains on investment securities of

$23.5 million

in


, compared to net gains of

$51.4 million

in


. The net gains on investment securities of

$23.5 million

in


were comprised of distributions from our strategic venture capital fund investments as well as gains from valuation increases for one of our equity method fund investments and net unrealized valuation increases from our managed funds of funds.

•

Fund management fees of $19.2 million for


, compared to $15.9 million in


. The increase was due primarily to the addition of new managed funds at SVB Capital.


compared to


Noninterest income increased $12.8 million to $70.9 million in 2015. SVB Capital’s components of noninterest income primarily include the following:

•

Net gains on investment securities of

$51.4 million

in


, compared to net gains of

$43.3 million

in 2014. The net gains on investment securities of

$51.4 million

in


were driven primarily by gains from our strategic and other investments driven by strong distributions from strategic venture capital fund investments and unrealized valuation increases from our managed funds of funds.

•

Fund management fees of $15.9 million for


, compared to $13.5 million in 2014. The increase was due primarily to the addition of new managed funds at SVB Capital.

Consolidated Financial Condition

Our total assets were

$44.7 billion

at both

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

, and

$39.3 billion

at

December 31, 2014

. Below is a summary of the individual components driving the changes in total assets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents totaled

$2.5 billion

at

December 31, 2016

, an increase of

$1.0 billion

, or

69.3 percent

, compared to

$1.5 billion

at

December 31, 2015

. The increase in cash at period-end resulted from proceeds from the sales of securities in the first half of 2016, bond maturities and mortgage security paydowns throughout the year, partially offset by an increase in loans during the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

As of

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

,

$1.1 billion

and

$405 million

, respectively, of our cash and due from banks was deposited at the FRB and was earning interest at the Federal Funds target rate, and interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions were

$721 million

and

$500 million

, respectively.

Investment Securities

Investment securities totaled

$21.7 billion

at

December 31, 2016

, a decrease of $4.1 billion, or

16.2 percent

, compared to

$25.8 billion

at

December 31, 2015

, which increased by $3.1 billion or

13.9 percent

, compared to

$22.7 billion

at

December 31, 2014

. Our investment securities portfolio consists of: (i) an available-for-sale securities portfolio and a held-to-maturity securities portfolio, both of which primarily represent interest-earning fixed income investment securities; and (ii) a non-marketable and other securities portfolio, which primarily represents investments managed as part of our funds management business. The decrease of $4.1 billion is primarily due to the sale of $2.9 billion of U.S. Treasury securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio. Additionally, $3.0 billion of paydowns and maturities in our fixed income securities portfolio were partially offset by $1.7 billion of new purchases. The major components of the change are explained below.



The following table presents a profile of our investment securities portfolio at

December 31, 2016

,


and


:

(1)

In 2015, we adopted new accounting guidance related to our consolidated variable interest entities (ASU 2015-02) under a modified retrospective approach.  Periods prior to January 1, 2015 have not been revised. See Note 2— "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and

Note 5—"Variable Interest Entities" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

for additional details regarding our non-marketable and other securities.

Available-for-Sale Securities

Period-end available-for-sale securities were

$12.6 billion

at

December 31, 2016

, compared to

$16.4 billion

at

December 31, 2015

, and

$13.5 billion

at

December 31, 2014

. The decrease of $3.8 billion in


was primarily due to the sale of $2.9 billion of U.S. Treasury securities and paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities of

$1.4 billion

, partially offset by purchases of new investments of

$0.4 billion

. The purchases of new investments of

$0.4 billion

were primarily comprised of fixed-rate U.S. Treasury securities and fixed-rate agency backed collateralized mortgage obligations. The paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities of

$1.4 billion

were comprised of $1.3 billion of fixed-rate securities and

$0.1 billion

in variable-rate securities.

Period-end available-for-sale securities at

December 31, 2015

increased $2.9 billion compared to 2014 primarily due to purchases of new investments of $4.6 billion, partially offset by paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities of $1.7 billion. The purchases of new investments of $4.6 billion were entirely comprised of fixed-rate U.S. Treasury securities. The paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities of $1.7 billion were comprised of $1.5 billion of fixed-rate securities and $0.2 billion in variable-rate securities.

The following table summarizes the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on fixed income securities, carried at fair value, classified as available-for-sale as of

December 31, 2016

. The weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of fixed income investment securities, which are reported at fair value. For U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. agency debentures, the expected maturity is the actual contractual maturity of the notes. Expected remaining maturities for certain U.S. agency debentures may occur earlier than their contractual maturities because the note issuers have the right to call outstanding amounts ahead of their contractual maturity. Expected maturities for mortgage-backed securities may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay outstanding loan obligations with or without penalties. Mortgage-backed securities classified as available-for-sale typically have original contractual maturities from 10 to 30 years whereas expected average lives of these securities tend to be significantly shorter and vary based upon structure and prepayments in lower rate environments. The weighted average yield on mortgage-backed securities is based on prepayment assumptions at the purchase date. Actual yields earned may differ significantly based upon actual prepayments.



Held-to-Maturity Securities

Period-end held-to-maturity securities were

$8.4 billion

at

December 31, 2016

, a decrease of

$0.4 billion

, or

4.1

percent, compared to

$8.8 billion

at

December 31, 2015

. The decrease was due to paydowns and scheduled maturities of $1.7 billion partially offset by purchases of $1.3 billion, primarily comprised of agency backed mortgage securities.

The 2015 increase, as compared to 2014, was due to purchases of $2.9 billion, primarily comprised of Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA") backed securities, partially offset by paydowns and scheduled maturities of $1.5 billion.

Securities classified as held-to-maturity are accounted for at cost with no adjustments for changes in fair value.  For securities re-designated as held-to-maturity from available-for-sale, the unrealized gains at the date of transfer will continue to be reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity and are being amortized over the life of the securities in a manner consistent with the amortization of a premium or discount.

The following table summarizes the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on fixed income investment securities classified as held-to-maturity as of

December 31, 2016

. Interest income on certain municipal bonds and notes (non-taxable investments) are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of

35.0 percent

. The weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of fixed income investment securities. For U.S. agency debentures, the expected maturity is the actual contractual maturity of the notes. Expected maturities for mortgage-backed securities may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay outstanding loan obligations with or without penalties. Mortgage-backed securities classified as held-to-maturity typically have original contractual maturities from 10 to 30 years whereas expected average lives of these securities tend to be significantly shorter and vary based upon structure and prepayments in lower rate environments. The weighted average yield on mortgage-backed securities is based on prepayment assumptions at the purchase date. Actual yields earned may differ significantly based upon actual prepayments.

Portfolio duration is a standard measure used to approximate changes in the market value of fixed income instruments due to a change in market interest rates. The measure is an estimate based on the level of current market interest rates, expectations for changes in the path of forward rates and the effect of forward rates on mortgage prepayment speed assumptions. As such, portfolio duration will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates. Changes in portfolio duration are also impacted by changes in the mix of longer versus shorter term-to-maturity securities. At

December 31, 2016

, our estimated fixed income securities portfolio duration was 2.5 years, compared to 2.7 and 2.8 years at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.



Non-Marketable and Other Securities

Non-marketable and other securities were

$622.6 million

at

December 31, 2016

, a decrease of $52.3 million, or

7.8 percent

, compared to

$674.9 million

at

December 31, 2015

, which decreased by

$1.1 billion

or

61.0 percent

, compared to

$1.7 billion

at

December 31, 2014

. Included in our non-marketable and other securities carried under fair value accounting are amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests. We are required under GAAP to consolidate certain SVB Capital funds, even though we may own less than 100 percent of such entities. See below for a summary of the carrying value (as reported) of non-marketable and other securities compared to the amounts attributable to SVBFG.

The decrease in non-marketable and other securities of $52.3 million in


was primarily related to sales of investments included in our qualified affordable housing projects portfolio totaling $46.5 million.

The decrease in non-marketable and other securities of $1.1 billion in


was primarily related to the deconsolidation of 16 limited partnership entities as part of our adoption of ASU 2015-02. Other 2015 activity included the following:

•

Gains of $40.8 million from our managed funds of funds, primarily related to unrealized valuation increases, and

•

Gains of $30.2 million from our strategic and other investments, primarily driven by strong distributions from our strategic venture capital fund investments reflective of IPO and M&A activity as well as unrealized valuation increases from certain investments.

The following table summarizes the carrying value (as reported) of non-marketable and other securities compared to the amounts attributable to SVBFG (which generally represents the carrying value times our ownership percentage) at

and


, respectively, and primarily represent corporate credit cards.

Both commercial and consumer loans increased from

December 31, 2015

to

December 31, 2016

with the largest increases coming from our private equity/venture capital, consumer real estate, software and internet and life science/healthcare  industry segments. The growth from our software and internet and life science/healthcare segments came primarily from growth in our Accelerator and Corporate Finance practices, while increased utilization from our capital call lines of credit contributed to the increase from our private equity/venture capital clients.  The growth in our consumer real estate came primarily from our Private Bank.



Loan Concentration

Loan concentrations may exist when there are borrowers engaged in similar activities or types of loans extended to a diverse group of borrowers that could cause those borrowers or portfolios to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. A substantial percentage of our loans are commercial in nature. The breakdown of total gross loans and total loans as a percentage of gross loans by industry sector is as follows:



The following table provides a summary of gross loans by size and category. The breakout of the categories is based on total client balances (individually or in the aggregate) as of

December 31, 2016

The credit profile of our loan portfolio clients varies based on the nature of the lending we do for different market segments.  Our three main market segments are (i) technology (software and internet, and hardware) and life science/healthcare, (ii) private equity/venture capital, and (iii) SVB Private Bank.

(i) Technology and Life Science/Healthcare

Our technology and life science/healthcare loan portfolios include loans to clients at all stages of their life cycles and represent the largest segments of our loan portfolio. The primary underwriting method for our technology and life science/healthcare portfolios are classified as investor dependent, balance sheet dependent, or cash flow dependent.

Investor dependent loans represented a relatively small percentage of our overall portfolio at 11 percent of total gross loans at

December 31, 2016

, compared to 12 percent at

December 31, 2015

. These loans are made to companies in both our Accelerator (early-stage) and Growth stage segments. Investor dependent loans typically have modest or negative cash flows and no established record of profitable operations. Repayment of these loans may be dependent upon receipt by borrowers of additional equity financing from venture capital firms or others, or in some cases, a successful sale to a third party or an IPO. Venture capital firms may provide financing selectively, at reduced amounts, or on less favorable terms, which may have an adverse effect on our borrowers' ability to repay their loans to us. When repayment is dependent upon the next round of venture investment and there is an indication that further investment is unlikely or will not occur, it is often likely that the company would need to be sold to repay debt in full. If reasonable efforts have not yielded a likely buyer willing to repay all debt at the close of the sale or on commercially viable terms, the account will most likely be deemed to be impaired.

Balance sheet dependent loans, which includes asset-based loans, represented 13

percent of total gross loans at

December 31, 2016

compared to 14 percent at

December 31, 2015

. Balance sheet dependent loans are structured to require constant current asset coverage (i.e. cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and, to a much lesser extent, inventory) in an amount that exceeds the outstanding debt. These loans are generally made to companies in our Growth and Corporate Finance practices. Our asset-based lending, which includes working capital lines and accounts receivable financing, represented seven percent and two percent of total gross loans at

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

, respectively. The repayment of these arrangements is dependent on the financial condition, and payment ability, of third parties with whom our clients do business.

Cash flow dependent loans, which include sponsored buyout lending, represent our largest source of repayment within our technology and life science/healthcare loan portfolios at approximately 20 percent of total gross loans at

December 31, 2016

, compared to 23 percent of total gross loans at

December 31, 2015

. Cash flow dependent loans require the borrower to maintain cash flow from operations that is sufficient to service all debt. Borrowers must demonstrate normalized cash flow in excess of all fixed charges associated with operating the business. Sponsored buyout loans represented 11 percent of total gross loans at

December 31, 2016

, compared to 13 percent of total gross loans at

December 31, 2015

. These loans are typically used to assist a select group of experienced private equity sponsors with the acquisition of businesses, are larger in size, and repayment is generally dependent upon the cash flows of the acquired company. The acquired companies are typically established, later-stage businesses of scale and characterized by reasonable levels of leverage and loan structures that include meaningful financial covenants. The sponsor's equity contribution is often 50 percent or more of the acquisition price.

(ii) Private Equity/Venture Capital

We also provide financial services to clients in the private equity/venture capital community. At

December 31, 2016

, our lending to private equity/venture capital firms and funds represented 39 percent of total gross loans, compared to 33 percent of total gross loans at

December 31, 2015

. The vast majority of this portfolio consists of capital call lines of credit, the repayment of which is dependent on the payment of capital calls by the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by these firms. These facilities are generally governed by meaningful financial covenants oriented towards ensuring that the funds' remaining callable capital is sufficient to repay the loan, and larger commitments (typically provided to larger private equity funds) are often secured by an assignment of the general partner's right to call capital from the fund's limited partner investors.

(iii) SVB Private Bank

Our SVB Private Bank clients are primarily private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders of the innovation companies. Our lending to SVB Private Bank clients represented 11 percent of total gross loans at both

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

. Many of these clients have mortgages, which represented 86 percent of this portfolio at

December 31, 2016

; the balance of this portfolio consisted of home equity lines of credit, restricted stock purchase loans, capital call lines of credit, and other secured and unsecured lending.



State Concentrations

Approximately 33 percent and 11 percent of our outstanding total gross loan balances as of

December 31, 2016

were to borrowers based in California and New York, respectively, compared to 34 percent and 12 percent as of

December 31, 2015

. Other than California and New York, there are no states with gross loan balances greater than 10 percent.

See generally "Risk Factors—Credit Risks" set forth under Part I, Item 1A of this report.



As of

December 31, 2016

,

88.8 percent

, or

$17.8 billion

, of our outstanding total gross loans were variable-rate loans that adjust at a prescribed measurement date upon a change in our prime-lending rate or other variable indices, compared to

85.2 percent

, or

$14.4 billion

, as of

December 31, 2015

. The following table sets forth the remaining contractual maturity distribution of our gross loans by industry sector at

December 31, 2016

, for fixed and variable rate loans:

Upon maturity, loans satisfying our credit quality standards may be eligible for renewal. Such renewals are subject to the normal underwriting and credit administration practices associated with new loans. We do not grant loans with unconditional extension terms.



Loan Administration

The Credit Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our credit risks and strategies, as well as our key credit policies and lending practices.

Subject to the oversight of the Credit Committee, lending authority is delegated to the Chief Credit Officer and our management's Loan Committee, which consists of the Chief Credit Officer and other senior members of our lending management. Requests for new and existing credit extensions that meet certain size and underwriting criteria may be approved outside of our Loan Committee by designated senior lenders or jointly with a senior credit officer or division risk manager.

Credit Quality Indicators

At both

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

, our total criticized loans and impaired loans represented six percent of our total gross loans. Criticized loans and impaired loans to early-stage clients represented 15 percent and 18 percent of our total criticized loans and impaired loan balances at

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

, respectively. Loans to early-stage clients represent a relatively small percentage of our overall portfolio at six percent of total gross loans at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. It is common for an early-stage client’s remaining liquidity to fall temporarily below the threshold for a pass-rated credit during its capital-raising period for a new round of funding. Based on our experience, for most early-stage clients, this situation typically lasts one to two quarters and generally resolves itself with a subsequent round of venture funding, though there are exceptions from time to time. As a result, we expect that each of our early-stage clients will reside in our criticized portfolio during a portion of their life cycle.



Credit Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses

The following table presents a summary of the activity for the allowance for loan losses as of the five most recent year-ends:



In 2016 total charge-offs increased to $96.9 million in 2016 compared to $51.0 million in 2015. The $45.9 million increase in total charge-offs was due primarily to venture capital market recalibration in 2016 which resulted in $44.9 million of early-stage charge-offs in 2016 compared to $12.0 million in 2015.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among specific classes of loans as of the five most recent year-ends:

(1)

Represents loan category as a percentage of total gross loans as of year-end.



Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets consist of loans on nonaccrual status, loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest, and Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) and other foreclosed assets. We measure all loans placed on nonaccrual status for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral or the net present value of the expected cash flows. The table below sets forth certain data and ratios between nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and the allowance for loan losses:

(1)

The “Reserve for unfunded credit commitments” is included as a component of other liabilities. See “Provision for Unfunded Credit Commitments” for a discussion of the changes to the reserve.

(2)

Includes unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.

Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans decreased to

1.13

percent at

December 31, 2016

, compared to

1.29

percent at

December 31, 2015

. This decrease was driven by a decrease in reserves for nonaccrual loans and a lower reserve rate for our gross performing loan portfolio, partially offset by increased reserves due to loan growth. Our reserve percentage for nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total gross loans decreased to

0.19 percent

at

December 31, 2016

, compared to

0.31 percent

at

December 31, 2015

, primarily as a result of charge-offs of previously reserved nonaccrual loans as well as a partial reserve release for one of our nonperforming sponsored buyout loans due to credit improvement. Our reserve percentage for performing loans as a percentage of total gross loans decreased to

0.94 percent

at

December 31, 2016

, compared to

0.98 percent

at

December 31, 2015

, reflective of the continued shift in the mix of our overall loan portfolio to our higher quality private equity/venture capital loan portfolio and enhancements to our methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses made during the fourth quarter of 2016.



Nonaccrual Loans

The following table presents a detailed composition of nonaccrual loans by industry sector as of the five most recent year-ends:

The following table presents a summary of changes in nonaccrual loans:

Our nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2016 included $79.7 million from three clients (two software and internet clients represented $57.2 million and one life science/healthcare client represented $22.5 million). Two of these loans are Sponsored Buyout loans that were added to our nonaccrual portfolio in 2015 and the other is a Corporate Finance client that is a new nonaccrual loan in 2016. The total credit exposure for our three largest nonaccrual loans is $79.7 million, for which we have specifically reserved $21.4 million.

Average nonaccrual loans for the years ended December 31,


,


,


,


and


were $108.7 million, $80.3 million, $24.5 million, $40.8 million and $35.8 million, respectively. The increase in average nonaccrual loans was attributable to the increase in nonaccrual loans from our software and internet and life science/healthcare loan portfolios. If the nonaccrual loans for


,


,


,


and


had not been nonperforming $4.6 million, $4.5 million, $1.2 million, $3.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in interest income would have been recorded.



Accrued Interest Receivable and Other Assets

A summary of accrued interest receivable and other assets at

December 31, 2016

and


is as follows:

(1)

See “Derivatives” section below.

Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Assets

The decrease of $89.8 million in foreign exchange spot contract assets was due to a lower number of unsettled client trades at December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015.

Accounts Receivable

The increase of $13.9 million in accounts receivable primarily related to fund management fee receivables from our SVB Capital funds management business.

Net Deferred Tax Assets

The decrease of $2.1 million in net deferred tax assets primarily relates to future taxable income attributable to tax accounting method change adjustments, offset by a decrease in future taxable income related to fund investments. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets related to deferred rent and allowance for loan losses.

Derivatives

Derivative instruments are recorded as a component of other assets and other liabilities on the balance sheet. The following table provides a summary of derivative assets and liabilities, net at

December 31, 2016

and


:

Equity Warrant Assets

In connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain rights to acquire stock in the form of equity warrant assets in primarily private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science/healthcare industries. At

December 31, 2016

, we held warrants in

1,739

companies, compared to

1,652

companies at

December 31, 2015

. Warrants in 17 companies each had values greater than $1.0 million and collectively represented 29 percent of the fair value of



the total warrant portfolio. The change in fair value of equity warrant assets is recorded in gains on derivatives instruments, net, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. The following table provides a summary of transactions and valuation changes for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


:

Foreign Exchange Forward and Foreign Currency Option Contracts

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts with clients involved in international activities, either as the purchaser or seller, depending upon the clients' need. We also enter into an opposite-way forward or option contract with a correspondent bank to economically hedge client contracts to mitigate the fair value risk to us from fluctuations in currency rates. Settlement, credit, and operational risks remain. We also enter into forward contracts with correspondent banks to economically hedge currency exposure risk related to certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Revaluations of foreign currency denominated instruments are recorded on the line item “Other” as part of noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. We have not experienced nonperformance by any counterparty to such forward or option contracts and therefore have not incurred any related losses. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties. Our net exposure for foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts at

December 31, 2016

and 2015 was $0.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively. For additional information on our foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, see

Note 13—"Derivative Financial Instruments" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

.

Client Interest Rate Derivatives

We sell interest rate contracts to clients who wish to mitigate their interest rate exposure. We economically reduce the interest rate risk from this business by entering into opposite way contracts with correspondent banks. Our net exposure for client interest rate derivative contracts was $0.3 million at

December 31, 2016

and our net exposure was zero at

December 31, 2015

. For information on our client interest rate derivatives, refer to

Note 13—"Derivative Financial Instruments" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

.

Deposits

The following table presents the composition of our deposits as of

December 31, 2016

,


and


:

The decrease in deposits of

$0.2 billion

in


was driven primarily by decreases in our money market and sweep deposits in foreign offices, partially offset by increases in our noninterest-bearing demand accounts from growth in our private-equity/venture capital and life science/health care portfolios. No material portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect our business. Approximately 12 percent, 13 percent and 16 percent of our total deposits at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were from our clients in Asia.



The increase in deposits of

$4.8 billion

in


was driven by increases in our noninterest-bearing demand accounts reflective of growth from new domestic and foreign clients and a result of strong M&A activity during the year resulting in increased balances from existing clients.

At

December 31, 2016

,

18.0 percent

of our total deposits were interest-bearing deposits, compared to

21.1 percent

at

December 31, 2015

and

28.4 percent

at

December 31, 2014

.

At

December 31, 2016

, the aggregate balance of time deposit accounts individually equal to or greater than $100,000 totaled $48 million, compared to $61 million at

December 31, 2015

and $116 million at

December 31, 2014

. At

December 31, 2016

, all time deposit accounts individually equal to or greater than $100,000 were scheduled to mature within one year. The maturity profile of our time deposits as of

December 31, 2016

is as follows:

Short-Term Borrowings

The following table summarizes our short-term borrowings that mature in one month or less:

On December 30, 2016, we borrowed $500 million from our available line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank to support the liquidity needs of the Bank.  The borrowings were repaid, subsequent to year-end, on January 6, 2017.

Average daily balances and maximum month-end balances for our short-term borrowings in


,


and


were as follows:



(1)

As part of our liquidity risk management practices, we periodically test availability and access to overnight borrowings in the Fed Funds market. These balances represent short-term borrowings.

(2)

Represents cash collateral received from certain counterparties in relation to market value exposures of derivative contracts in our favor and our interest rate swap agreement related to our 6.05% Subordinated Notes.

Long-Term Debt

The following table represents outstanding long-term debt at

December 31, 2016

,


and


:

The increase in our long-term debt in 2015 was due to the issuance on January 29, 2015, of $350 million of 3.50% Senior Notes due in January 2025.

For more information on our long-term debt outstanding at

December 31, 2016

.

Other Liabilities

A summary of other liabilities at

December 31, 2016

and


is as follows:

(1)

See “Derivatives” section above.

Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Liabilities

The decrease of $86.7 million in foreign exchange spot contract liabilities was due to a lower number of unsettled client trades at December 31, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015.

Accrued Compensation

Accrued compensation includes amounts for our Incentive Compensation Plan, Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan, Retention Program, Warrant Incentive Plan, ESOP and other compensation arrangements. The decrease of $15.3 million was primarily the result of smaller incentive compensation accruals at December 31, 2016 based on our financial performance for 2016. For a description of our variable compensation plans, refer to

Note 16—"Employee Compensation and Benefit Plans" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

.

Reserve for Unfunded Credit Commitments

Our reserve for unfunded credit commitments increased to $45.3 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $34.4 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily as a result of enhancements to our reserve for unfunded credit commitments.



Other

Other liabilities increased $36.7 million to $304.8 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $268.1 million at December 31, 2015, primarily related to increases in various miscellaneous accrued liabilities including unsettled purchases of investment securities, deferred rent, accrual for performance-based restricted stock unit plan, deferred compensation and deferred management fees.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests totaled

$134.5 million

and

$135.1 million

at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively. The decrease was due to net capital distributions of

$8.2 million

to investors in our managed funds of funds, partially offset by net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of

$7.6 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.  For more information, refer to

Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

.

Capital Resources

We maintain an adequate capital base to support anticipated asset growth, operating needs and credit and other business risks, and to provide for SVB Financial and the Bank to be in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines, including the joint agency rules implementing the "Basel III" capital rules. Our primary sources of new capital include retained earnings and proceeds from the sale and issuance of our capital stock or other securities. In consultation with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, management engages in regular capital planning processes in an effort to optimize the use of the capital available to us and to appropriately plan for our future capital needs. The capital plan considers capital needs for the foreseeable future and allocates capital to both existing and future business activities. Expected future use or activities for which capital may be set aside include balance sheet growth and associated relative increases in market or credit exposure, investment activity, potential product and business expansions, acquisitions and strategic or infrastructure investments. In addition, we conduct capital stress tests as part of our annual capital planning process. The capital stress tests allow us to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy and interest rates on our capital adequacy position.

SVBFG Stockholders’ Equity

SVBFG stockholders’ equity totaled

$3.6 billion

at

December 31, 2016

, an increase of

$444 million

, or

13.9 percent

compared to

$3.2 billion

at

December 31, 2015

. This increase was primarily the result of net income of

$383 million

in


and an increase in additional paid-in capital of

$54 million

reflective of amortization of share-based compensation and the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans.

Funds generated through retained earnings are a significant source of capital and liquidity and are expected to continue to be so in the future.



Capital Ratios

Regulatory capital ratios for SVB Financial and the Bank exceeded minimum federal regulatory guidelines for a well-capitalized bank holding company and insured depository institution, respectively, as of

December 31, 2016

,


and


. See

Note 20—"Regulatory Matters" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

for further information. Capital ratios for SVB Financial and the Bank, compared to the minimum regulatory ratios to be considered “well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized”, are set forth below:

(1)

Effective January 1, 2015, CET 1 is a new ratio requirement under the "Basel III" Capital Rules and represents, common stock, plus related surplus and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less certain regulatory deductions, divided by total risk-weighted assets.

(2)

Ratios as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 reflect the adoption of the "Basel III" Capital Rules in effect beginning January 1, 2015. Ratios for prior periods represent the previous capital rules under Basel I.

(3)

See below for a reconciliation of non-GAAP tangible common equity to tangible assets and tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets.

(4)

The FRB has not issued any minimum guidelines for the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio or the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio. However, we believe these ratios provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our capital levels and are therefore provided above.


compared to


The total risk-based capital and tier 1 capital ratios for both SVB Financial and the Bank increased as of December 31, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015. The increases were a result of the proportionally higher increase in our capital compared to the increases in risk-weighted assets during the year ended December 31, 2016. Increased capital was reflective primarily of year-to-date earnings and issuance of common stock related to equity-based employee stock plans resulting from an increase in SVB Financial's stock price during the latter half of 2016. The growth in period-end risk-weighted assets was primarily from period-end loan growth, partially offset by a decrease in risk-weighted assets from fixed income securities. SVB Financial's and the Bank's tier 1 leverage ratios increased 71 basis points and 58 basis points, respectively, as of December 31, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in tier 1 leverage ratios were reflective of an increase in tier 1 capital, primarily from retained earnings, relative to the increase in average assets. All of our reported capital ratios remain above the levels considered to be “well capitalized” under applicable banking regulations.


compared to


The total risk-based capital and tier 1 capital ratios as of December 31, 2015, for SVB Financial decreased compared to December 31, 2014. The decrease in SVB Financial's risk-based capital was primarily due to the impact of the Basel III risk-weighting standards on unused loan commitments with original maturities of one year or less and certain equity investments related to our noncontrolling interests as well as a proportionally higher increase in risk-weighted and average assets compared to the increase in our capital during 2015. SVB Financial's tier 1 leverage ratio decreased compared to December 31, 2014 primarily due to the increase in average assets, driven by the growth in deposits. For the Bank, the total risk-based capital, tier 1 capital,



and tier 1 leverage ratios as of December 31, 2015, increased compared to the same ratios as of December 31, 2014. This increase was a result of SVB Financial's contribution of capital to the Bank totaling $350 million, which was funded primarily by the net proceeds from the issuance of our 3.50% Senior Notes. The capital contribution from SVB Financial to the Bank was provided to support our clients' continued growth during 2015. The increases in the Bank's ratios, resulting from the contribution, were partially offset by the impact of the new regulatory requirements related to unused commitments as discussed above. All of our capital ratios are above the levels to be considered “well capitalized" under banking regulations.

Non-GAAP Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets and Non-GAAP Tangible Common Equity to Risk-weighted Assets

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio and the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios are not required by GAAP or applicable bank regulatory requirements. However, we believe these ratios provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our capital levels. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these ratios in evaluating the adequacy of the Company’s capital levels; however, this financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These ratios are calculated by dividing total SVBFG stockholder’s equity, by total period-end assets and risk-weighted assets, after reducing both amounts by acquired intangibles, if any. The manner in which this ratio is calculated varies among companies. Accordingly, our ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar measures of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures defined by GAAP:

(1)

Amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 reflect the adoption of the Basel III Capital Rules in effect beginning January 1, 2015. Amounts and ratios for prior periods represent the previous capital rules under Basel I.


compared to


For both SVB Financial and the Bank, the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratios and the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios increased due to the proportionally higher increase in tangible common equity as compared to changes to tangible and risk-weighted assets. See "SVBFG Stockholders’ Equity" above for further details on changes to the individual components of our equity balance.


compared to


For SVB Financial, the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio decreased due to increases in risk-weighted assets, as a result of the new Basel III regulatory requirements, partially offset by increases in common equity.  For the Bank, the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio increased due to increases in tangible common equity, partially offset by



increases in risk-weighted assets. These increases were a result of SVB Financial's contribution of capital to the Bank, partially offset by the impact on risk-weighted assets from the new Basel III regulatory requirements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

In the normal course of business, we use financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and commercial and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. Credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The actual liquidity needs and the credit risk that we have experienced have historically been lower than the contractual amount of these commitments because a significant portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. Refer to the discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements in

Note 18—"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

.

The following table summarizes our unfunded commercial commitments as of

December 31, 2016

:

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to make future payments as of

December 31, 2016

:

(1)

Includes time deposits and deposits with no defined maturity, such as noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing checking, savings, money-market and sweep accounts.

(2)

Amounts exclude contractual interest.

Excluded from the tables above are unfunded commitment obligations of $18.1 million to our managed funds of funds and other fund investments for which neither the payment, timing, nor eventual obligation is certain. Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, including the Volcker Rule (see "Business - Supervision and Regulation" under Part I, Item 1 of this report), we make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, which in turn make investments generally in, or in some cases make loans to, privately-held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally made for a


-year period from the inception of the fund. Although the limited partnership agreements governing these investments typically do not restrict the general partners from calling

100%

of committed capital in one year, it is customary for these funds to generally call most of the capital commitments over


to


years; however in certain cases, the funds may not call

100%

of committed capital over the life of the fund. The actual timing of future cash requirements to fund these commitments is generally dependent upon the investment cycle, overall market conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held companies operate. Additionally, our consolidated managed funds of funds have $4.5 million of remaining unfunded commitments to venture capital and private equity funds. See

Note 8—"Investment Securities" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

for further disclosure related to non-marketable and other securities. Additional discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements for these fund investments is included in

Note 18—"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

.



Liquidity

The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet our financial obligations, including, as necessary, paying creditors, meeting depositors’ needs, accommodating loan demand and growth, funding investments, repurchasing securities and other operating or capital needs, without incurring undue cost or risk, or causing a disruption to normal operating conditions.

We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and economic conditions, individual client funding needs, and existing and planned business activities. Our Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”), which is a management committee, provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines for the approval of the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, and courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity needs. Additionally, we routinely conduct liquidity stress testing as part of our liquidity management practices.

Our deposit base is, and historically has been, our primary source of liquidity. Our deposit levels and cost of deposits may fluctuate from time to time due to a variety of factors, including market conditions, prevailing interest rates, changes in client deposit behaviors, availability of insurance protection, and our offering of deposit products. At

December 31, 2016

, our period-end total deposit balances decreased to

$39.0 billion

, compared to

$39.1 billion

at

December 31, 2015

.

Our liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of our portfolio of liquid assets. Our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations, short-term investment securities maturing within one year, available-for-sale securities eligible and available for financing or pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of one year and anticipated near-term cash flows from investments.

We have certain facilities in place to enable us to access short-term borrowings on a secured (using available-for-sale securities as collateral) and an unsecured basis. These include repurchase agreements and uncommitted federal funds lines with various financial institutions. We also pledge securities to the FHLB of San Francisco and the discount window at the FRB. The market value of collateral pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco (comprised primarily of U.S. agency debentures) at

December 31, 2016

totaled

$1.7 billion

, of which

$1.2 billion

was unused and available to support additional borrowings. The market value of collateral pledged at the discount window of the FRB at

December 31, 2016

totaled

$0.8 billion

, all of which was unused and available to support additional borrowings.

On a stand-alone basis, SVB Financial’s primary liquidity channels include dividends from the Bank, its portfolio of liquid assets, and its ability to raise debt and capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is subject to certain regulations described in “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Restrictions on Dividends” under Part I, Item 1 of this report.

ITEM 7A.         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk Management

Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse fluctuations in the market value of financial instruments due to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk is our primary market risk and can result from timing and volume differences in the repricing of our rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, widening or tightening of credit spreads, changes in the general level of market interest rates and changes in the shape and level of the benchmark LIBOR/SWAP yield curve. Additionally, changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on mortgage securities, which affects the rate of amortization of purchase premiums and discounts. Other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk. These risks are not considered significant compared to interest rate sensitive risks and no separate quantitative information concerning them is presented herein.

Interest rate risk is managed by our ALCO. ALCO reviews the market valuation and 12-month forward-looking earnings sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates, structural changes in investment and funding portfolios, loan and deposit activity and current market conditions. Adherence to relevant policies, which are approved by the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, is monitored on an ongoing basis.

Management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving our fixed income securities portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, our policies permit the use of off-balance sheet derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk.

We utilize a simulation model to perform a sensitivity analysis on the economic value of equity and net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios, balance sheet forecasts and proposed strategies. The simulation model provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity embedded in our balance sheet which measures the potential variability in forecasted results relating to changes in market interest rates over time. We review our interest rate risk position on a quarterly basis at a minimum.

Model Simulation and Sensitivity Analysis

One application of the aforementioned simulation model involves measurement of the impact of changes in market interest rates on our economic value of equity ("EVE"). EVE is defined as the market value of assets, less the market value of liabilities, adjusted for any off-balance sheet items. A second application of the simulation model measures the impact of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income ("NII") assuming a static balance sheet as of the period-end reporting date. Applying a static balance sheet assumption means that the size and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities remains the same throughout the simulation horizon. Variations in cash flows from asset and liability balances that are sensitive to the level of interest rates are replaced with balances of similar characteristics and at interest rates consistent with each specific simulation. Changes in market interest rates that affect us are principally short-term interest rates and include the following: (i) National Prime and SVB Prime rates; (ii) 1-month and 3-month LIBOR; and (iii) the Fed Funds target rate. Changes in these short-term rates impact interest earned on our variable rate loans, variable rate investment securities and balances held as cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, deposit pricing generally follows the direction of overall changes in short-term interest rates but not in the same proportion. Generally, modeled pricing changes on interest-bearing deposits are assumed to be less than one-half of the change in short-term market rates.

For the period ended December 31, 2016, an assumption change was applied to the EVE simulation model for the discount spreads applied to our loan balances.  Prior to this change, discount spread assumptions were derived utilizing the historical data of new loans that had originated in the previous month.  The new methodology derives loan discount spread assumptions using a historical rolling six-month average of new loan originations. The assumption change produced a lower overall discount spread on our loan balances at December 31, 2016, ultimately resulting in a higher base case EVE of $453 million and a lower base case estimated NII of $2 million, as compared to the respective base cases as derived under the prior methodology. We believe the new methodology produces a discount spread assumption that is more stable from period to period and better represents the overall market for our loan balances.

This assumption change did not have a significant impact on NII sensitivity results, nor did it substantially change the EVE sensitivity profile. The impact of this modeling change was primarily to the overall level of EVE.



The following table presents our EVE and NII sensitivity exposure related to an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points ("bps") at

December 31, 2016

, presented under both the current and prior assumption methodologies for comparative purposes, and at

December 31, 2015

, as previously reported:

Economic Value of Equity

The estimated EVE in the preceding table is based on a combination of valuation methodologies including a discounted cash flow analysis and a multi-path lattice based valuation. Both methodologies use publicly available market interest rates. The model simulations and calculations are highly assumption-dependent and will change regularly as our asset/liability structure changes, as interest rate environments evolve, and as we change our assumptions in response to relevant market or business circumstances. These calculations do not reflect the changes that we anticipate or may make to reduce our EVE exposure in response to a change in market interest rates as a part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy.

As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain limitations are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding table. We are exposed to yield curve risk, prepayment risk and basis risk, which cannot be fully modeled and expressed using the above methodology. Accordingly, the results in the preceding table should not be presented as precise indicators of actual results stemming from changes in market interest rates. It follows that the resulting EVE and NII estimates are not intended to represent, and should not be construed to represent the underlying value.

Our base case EVE as of December 31, 2016 increased from December 31, 2015 by $1.1 billion as compared to December 31, 2015, driven primarily by the change in our balance sheet composition. At December 31, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015, total loan balances increased by $3.2 billion primarily in variable-rate loans, while total fixed income securities decreased by $4.1 billion primarily due to portfolio sales and maturities. Additionally, total deposits decreased by $0.2 billion and cash and cash equivalent balances increased by $1.0 billion.

Marginally higher LIBOR rates in the 3- to 12-month term points continue to drive a relatively flat yield curve compared to December 31, 2015. These higher rates, along with the growth in variable-rate loans contributed to a $160 million increase in EVE sensitivity in the +100 bps rate shock scenario.  EVE sensitivity in the -100 and -200 bps rate shock scenarios decreased $438 million and $305 million, respectively. Changes in these scenarios can be attributed to the increase in the yield curve described above, which causes the discount curves for loans and deposits to hit fewer floors as compared to the curve as of December 31, 2015. This allows more of the impact from a downward rate shock to flow through the valuation.



12-Month Net Interest Income Simulation

Our estimated 12-month NII forecast at December 31, 2016 increased from December 31, 2015 by $66 million

,

primarily due to the change in balance sheet composition previously noted in the EVE section above. A larger portion of higher-yielding, variable rate loans relative to lower-yield fixed income securities resulted in an increase in estimated 12-month NII. As rates rise, the proportionately greater amounts of variable rate loans are expected to benefit our base 12-month NII projections. In addition, the 12-month NII simulations include repricing assumptions on our interest bearing deposit products which are applied at our discretion based on client needs and our overall funding mix. Repricing of interest bearing deposits impacts estimated noninterest expense. As noted previously, repricing deposit rates are generally assumed to be less than one-half of the amount of simulated changes in short-term market interest rates.

NII sensitivity at December 31, 2016 in the +100 and +200 bps interest rate shock scenarios increased $55 million and $108 million, respectively, as compared to December 31, 2015. These changes are due primarily to the changing composition of the balance sheet as noted above. Specifically, a relative increase in variable rate loans, coupled with a higher proportion of non-interest bearing deposit balances is expected to result in an increased NII in a rising rate environment.

The simulation model used in the above analysis embeds floors in our interest rate scenarios, which prevent model benchmark rates from moving below 0.0%.  In addition, we assume different deposit balance decay rates for each interest rate scenario based on a historical deposit study of our clients. These assumptions may change in future periods based on management discretion. Actual changes in our deposit pricing strategies may differ from our current model assumptions and may have an impact on our overall sensitivity.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates may change as new information is obtained. Significant items that are subject to such estimates include measurements of fair value, the valuation of non-marketable and other securities, the valuation of equity warrant assets, the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded credit commitments and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The following discussion provides additional background on our significant accounting policies.

Principles of Consolidation and Presentation

Prior to April 1, 2015, the Company’s consolidated financial statements included the accounts of SVB Financial Group and entities in which we had a controlling interest.  The determination of whether we had a controlling interest was based on consolidation principles prescribed by ASC Topic 810,

Consolidation

, and whether the controlling interest in an entity was a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (“VIE”). However, during the three months ended June 30, 2015, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (ASU 2015-02), which simplifies consolidation accounting by reducing the number of consolidation models and changing various aspects of current GAAP, including certain consolidation criteria for variable interest entities. The new guidance eliminates the presumption that a general partner of a limited partnership arrangement should consolidate a limited partnership. The amendments to ASC Topic 810 in ASU 2015-02 modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar entities are VIEs or voting entities. With these changes, we determined that the majority of our investments in limited partnership arrangements are VIEs under the new guidance while these entities were typically voting interest entities under the prior guidance.

ASU 2015-02 provided a single model for evaluating VIE entities for consolidation. VIEs are entities where investors lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or equity investors and, as a group, lack one of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, (b) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (c) the right to receive the expected returns of the entity. We assess VIEs to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE.  A primary beneficiary is defined as a variable interest holder that has a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest requires both: (a) the



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of a VIE that could potentially be significant to a VIE. Under this analysis, we also evaluate kick-out rights and other participating rights, which could provide us a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE.

ASU 2015-02 also changed how we evaluate fees paid to managers of our limited partnership investments. Under the new guidance, we exclude those fee arrangements that are not deemed to be variable interests from the analysis of our interests in our investments in VIEs and the determination of a primary beneficiary, if any. Fee arrangements based on terms that are customary and commensurate with the services provided are deemed not to be variable interests and are, therefore, excluded.

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SVB Financial Group and consolidated entities. We consolidate voting entities in which we have control through voting interests. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in a VIE by determining if we have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and whether we have significant variable interests. Generally, we have significant variable interests if our commitments to a limited partnership investment represent a significant amount of the total commitments to the entity. We also evaluate the impact of related parties on our determination of variable interests in our consolidation conclusions. We consolidate VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary based on a controlling financial interest. If we are not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we record our pro-rata interests or our cost basis in the VIE, as appropriate, based on other accounting guidance within GAAP.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions with consolidated entities have been eliminated. We have not provided financial or other support during the periods presented to any VIE that we were not previously contractually required to provide.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, cash balances due from banks, interest-earning deposits, Federal Reserve deposits, federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell and other short-term investment securities. For the consolidated statements of cash flows, we consider cash equivalents to be investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, so near to their maturity that they present an insignificant risk of change in fair value due to changes in market interest rates, and purchased in conjunction with our cash management activities.

Investment Securities

Available-for-Sale Securities

Our available-for-sale securities portfolio is a fixed income investment portfolio that is managed to earn an appropriate portfolio yield over the long-term while maintaining sufficient liquidity and credit diversification and meeting our asset/liability management objectives. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of applicable taxes, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of SVBFG's stockholders' equity, until realized.

We analyze available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment each quarter. Market valuations represent the current fair value of a security at a specified point in time and incorporates the risk of timing of interest due and the return of principal over the contractual life of each security. Gains and losses on securities are realized when there is a sale of the security prior to maturity. A credit downgrade represents an increased level of risk of other-than-temporary impairment, and as a part of our consideration of recording an other-than-temporary impairment we will assess the issuer's ability to service the debt and to repay the principal at contractual maturity.

We apply the other-than-temporary impairment standards of ASC 320,

Investments-Debt and Equity Securities

. For our debt securities, we have the intent and ability to hold these securities until we recover our cost less any credit-related loss. We separate the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment, if any, into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between a security's amortized cost basis and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the security's effective interest rate. The amount due to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income.

We consider numerous factors in determining whether a credit loss exists and the period over which the debt security is expected to recover. The following list is not meant to be all inclusive. All of the following factors are considered:

•

The length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis (severity and duration);



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

•

Adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or geographic area; for example, changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset-backed debt security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors. Examples of those changes include any of the following:

◦

Changes in technology;

◦

The discontinuance of a segment of the business that may affect the future earnings potential of the issuer or underlying loan obligors of the security; and

◦

Changes in the quality of the credit enhancement.

•

The historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security;

•

The payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future;

•

Failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments;

•

Any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; and

•

Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.

In accordance with ASC 310-20,

Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs

, we use estimates of future principal prepayments, provided by third-party market-data vendors, in addition to actual principal prepayment experience to calculate the constant effective yield necessary to apply the effective interest method in the amortization of purchase discounts or premiums on mortgage-backed securities and fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”). The accretion and amortization of discounts and premiums, respectively, are included in interest income over the contractual terms of the underlying securities replicating the effective interest method.

Held-to-Maturity Securities

Debt securities purchased in which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to its maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities and are recorded at amortized cost.

During the second quarter of 2014, we re-designated certain securities from the classification of available-for-sale to held-to-maturity.  Transfers of investment securities into the held-to-maturity category from the available-for-sale category are made at fair value at the date of transfer. The unrealized gains (losses), net of tax, are retained in other comprehensive income, and the carrying value of the held-to-maturity securities are amortized over the life of the securities in a manner consistent with the amortization of a premium or discount.  Our decision to re-designate the securities was based on our ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity.

Non-Marketable and Other Securities

Non-marketable and other securities include investments in venture capital and private equity funds, our China Joint Venture, debt funds, private and public portfolio companies and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. A majority of these investments are managed through our SVB Capital funds business in funds of funds and direct venture funds. Our accounting for investments in non-marketable and other securities depends on several factors, including the level of ownership, power to control and the legal structure of the subsidiary making the investment. As further described below, we base our accounting for such securities on: (i) fair value accounting, (ii) equity method accounting, (iii) cost method accounting, and (iv) the proportional amortization method which is used only for qualified affordable housing projects.

Fair Value Accounting

Our managed funds are investment companies under the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies (codified in ASC 946) and accordingly, these funds report their investments at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as investment gains or losses in our consolidated statements of income. Our non-marketable and other securities recorded pursuant to fair value accounting consist of our investments through the following funds:

•

Funds of funds, which make investments in venture capital and private equity funds,

•

Direct venture funds, which make equity investments in privately held companies.



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

A summary of our ownership interests in the investments held under fair value accounting as of

December 31, 2016

is presented in the following table:

The general partner interests of these funds are controlled, and in some cases, owned by SVB Financial. The limited partners of these funds do not have substantive participating or kick-out rights. Therefore, these funds are consolidated and any gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in our consolidated net income.

Under fair value accounting, investments are carried at their estimated fair value based on financial information obtained as the general partner of the fund or obtained from the funds' respective general partner. For direct private company investments, valuations are based upon consideration of a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, exit strategies and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. For direct equity investments in public companies, valuations are based on quoted market prices less a discount if the securities are subject to certain sales restrictions. Sales restriction discounts generally range from

10%

to

20%

depending on the duration of the sale restrictions which typically range from

three

to

six

months. The valuation of non-marketable securities in shares of private company capital stock and the valuation of other securities in shares of public company stock with certain sales restrictions is subject to significant judgment. The inherent uncertainty in the process of valuing securities for which a ready market does not exist may cause our estimated values of these securities to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences could be material.

For our fund investments, we utilize the net asset value as obtained from the general partners of the fund investments as the funds do not have a readily determinable fair value.  The general partners of our fund investments prepare their financial statements using guidance consistent with fair value accounting. We account for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment's net asset value by using the most recent available financial information from the investee general partner, for example September 30

th

, for our December 31

st

consolidated financial statements.  We adjust the value of our investments for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and known significant fund transactions or market events about which we are aware through information provided by the fund managers or from publicly available transaction data during the reporting period.

Gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the investments and from distributions received are recorded as gains on investment securities, net, a component of noninterest income. The portion of any investment gains or losses attributable to the limited partners is reflected as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and adjusts our net income to reflect its percentage ownership.

Equity Method

Our equity method non-marketable securities consist of investments in venture capital and private equity funds, privately-held companies, debt funds, and joint ventures. Our equity method non-marketable securities and related accounting policies are described as follows:

•

Equity securities, such as preferred or common stock in privately-held companies in which we hold a voting interest of at least

20 percent

, or in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investees' operating and financial policies through board involvement or other influence, are accounted for under the equity method.



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

•

Investments in limited partnerships in which we hold voting interests of more than

5 percent

, or in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the partnerships' operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method.

•

Our China Joint Venture partnership, for which we have

50 percent

ownership, is accounted for under the equity method.

We recognize our proportionate share of the results of operations of these equity method investees in our results of operations, based on the most current financial information available from the investee. We review our investments accounted for under the equity method at least quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. Our review typically includes an analysis of facts and circumstances for each investment, the expectations of the investment's future cash flows and capital needs, variability of its business and the company's exit strategy. For our fund investments, we utilize the net asset value per share as provided by the general partners of the fund investments. We account for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment's net asset value by using the most recent available financial information from the investee general partner, for example September 30

th

, for our December 31

st

consolidated financial statements.  We adjust the value of our investments for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and known significant fund transactions or market events about which we are aware through information provided by the fund managers or from publicly available transaction data during the reporting period.

We reduce our investment value when we consider declines in value to be other-than-temporary and recognize the estimated loss as a loss on investment securities, a component of noninterest income.

Cost Method

Our cost method non-marketable securities and related accounting policies are described as follows:

•

Equity securities, such as preferred or common stock in privately-held companies in which we hold an ownership interest in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investees' operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the cost method.

•

Investments in limited partnerships in which we hold voting interests of less than

5 percent

and in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the partnerships' operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the cost method. These non-marketable securities include investments in venture capital and private equity funds.

We record these investments at cost and recognize distributions or returns received from net accumulated earnings of the investee since the date of acquisition as income. Our share of net accumulated earnings of the investee after the date of investment are recognized in consolidated net income only to the extent distributed by the investee. Distributions or returns received in excess of accumulated earnings are considered a return of investment and are recorded as reductions in the cost basis of the investment.

We review our investments accounted for under the cost method at least quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. Our review typically includes an analysis of facts and circumstances of each investment, the expectations of the investment's future cash flows and capital needs, variability of its business and the company's exit strategy. To help determine impairment, if any, for our fund investments, we utilize the net asset value per share as provided by the general partners of the fund investments.

We reduce our investment value when we consider declines in value to be other-than-temporary and recognize the estimated loss as a loss on investment securities, a component of noninterest income.

Gains or losses on cost method investment securities that result from a portfolio company being acquired by a publicly traded company are determined using the fair value of the consideration received when the acquisition occurs. The resulting gains or losses are recognized in consolidated net income in the period of acquisition.

Proportional Amortization Method

In order to fulfill our responsibilities under the Community Reinvestment Act, we invest as a limited partner in low income housing partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing projects and generate tax benefits, including federal low income housing tax credits, for investors. The partnerships are deemed to be VIEs because they do not have sufficient equity investment at risk and are structured with non-substantive voting rights. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and do not consolidate



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

them. Our investments in low income housing partnerships are recorded in non-marketable and other securities within our investment securities portfolio on the consolidated balance sheet. As a practical expedient, we amortize the investment in proportion to the allocated tax benefits under the proportional amortization method of accounting and present such benefits net of investment amortization in income tax expense.

Loans

Loans are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned loan fees. Unearned loan fees reflect unamortized deferred loan origination and commitment fees net of unamortized deferred loan origination costs. In addition to cash loan fees, we often obtain equity warrant assets that give us an option to purchase a position in a client company's stock in consideration for providing credit facilities. The grant date fair values of these equity warrant assets are deemed to be loan fees and are deferred as unearned income and recognized as an adjustment of loan yield through loan interest income. The net amount of unearned loan fees is amortized into loan interest income over the contractual terms of the underlying loans and commitments using the constant effective yield method, adjusted for actual loan prepayment experience, or the straight-line method, as applicable.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses considers credit risk and is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. Our allowance for loan losses is established for estimated loan losses that are probable and incurred but not yet realized. Our evaluation process is designed to determine that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate at the balance sheet date. The process of estimating loan losses is inherently imprecise.

We maintain a systematic process for the evaluation of individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses. At the time of approval, each loan in our portfolio is assigned a Credit Risk Rating and industry niche. Credit Risk Ratings are assigned on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing loans with a low risk of nonpayment, 9 representing loans with the highest risk of nonpayment, and 10 representing loans which have been charged-off.  The credit risk ratings for each loan are monitored and updated on an ongoing basis. This Credit Risk Rating process includes, but is not limited to, consideration of such factors as payment status, the financial condition and operating performance of the borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral values and performance trends, the degree of access to additional capital, the presence of credit enhancements such as third party guarantees (where applicable), the degree to which the borrower is sensitive to external factors, the depth and experience of the borrower's management team, potential loan concentrations, and general economic conditions. Our policies require a committee of senior management to review, at least quarterly, credit relationships with a credit risk rating of 5 through 9 that exceed specific dollar values. Our review process evaluates the appropriateness of the credit risk rating and allocation of the allowance for loan losses, as well as other account management functions. The allowance for loan losses is determined based on a qualitative analysis and a formula allocation for similarly risk-rated loans by portfolio segment and individually for impaired loans. The formula allocation provides the average loan loss experience for each portfolio segment, which considers our quarterly historical loss experience since the year 2000, both by risk-rating category and client industry sector. The resulting loan loss factors for each risk-rating category and client industry sector are ultimately applied to the respective period-end client loan balances for each corresponding risk-rating category by client industry sector to provide an estimation of the allowance for loan losses. The probable loan loss experience for any one year period of time is reasonably expected to be greater or less than the average as determined by the loss factors. As such, management applies a qualitative allocation to the results of the aforementioned model to ascertain the total allowance for loan losses. This qualitative allocation is based on management's assessment of the risks that may lead to a loan loss experience different from our historical loan loss experience. Based on management's prediction or estimate of changing risks in the lending environment, the qualitative allocation may vary significantly from period to period and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of the following factors:

•

Changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collections, and charge-off and recovery practices;

•

Changes in national and local economic business conditions, including the market and economic condition of our clients' industry sectors;

•

Changes in the nature of our loan portfolio;

•

Changes in experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff;

•

Changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans;

•

Changes in the trend of the volume of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, and other loan modifications;



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

•

Reserve floor for portfolio segments that would not draw a minimum reserve based on the lack of historical loan loss experience;

•

Reserve for large funded loan exposure; and

•

Other factors as determined by management from time to time.

While the evaluation process of our allowance for loan losses uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of the allowance for loan losses rely, to a great extent, on the judgment and experience of our management.

Reserve for Unfunded Credit Commitments

We record a liability for probable and estimable incurred losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments being funded and subsequently being charged off. Each quarter, every unfunded client credit commitment is allocated to a credit risk-rating in accordance with each client's credit risk rating and portfolio segment. We use the historical loan loss factors described under our allowance for loan losses to calculate the loan loss experience if unfunded credit commitments are funded. Separately, we use historical trends to calculate a probability of an unfunded credit commitment being funded. We apply the loan funding probability factor to risk-factor adjusted unfunded credit commitments by credit risk-rating and portfolio segment to derive the reserve for unfunded credit commitments, similar to funded loans. The reserve for unfunded credit commitments also includes certain qualitative allocations as deemed appropriate by management. We include the reserve for unfunded credit commitments in other liabilities and the related provision in other expenses.

Uncollectible Loans and Write-offs

Our charge-off policy applies to all loans, regardless of portfolio segment. Commercial loans are considered for a full or partial charge-off in the event that principal or interest is over 180 days past due and the loan lacks sufficient collateral and it is not in the process of collection, provided that a loss event has been defined and the charge-off is consistent with GAAP.  Consumer loans are considered for a full or partial charge-off in the event that principal or interest is over 120 days past due and the loan lacks sufficient collateral and it is not in the process of collection, provided that a loss event has been defined and the charge-off is consistent with GAAP. We also consider writing off loans in the event of any of the following circumstances: 1) the loan, or a portion of the loan is deemed uncollectible due to: a) the borrower's inability to make recurring payments, b) material changes in the borrower's financial condition, or c) the expected sale of all or a portion of the borrower's business is insufficient to repay the loan in full, or 2) the loan has been identified for charge-off by regulatory authorities.

Troubled Debt Restructurings

A TDR arises from the modification of a loan where we have granted a concession to the borrower related to the borrower's financial difficulties that we would not have otherwise considered for economic or legal reasons. These concessions may include: (1) deferral of payment for more than an insignificant period of time that does not include sufficient offsetting borrower concessions; (2) interest rate reductions; (3) extension of the maturity date outside of ordinary course extension; (4) principal forgiveness; and/or (5) reduction of accrued interest.

We use the factors in ASC 310-40,

Receivables, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors,

in analyzing when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and when we have granted a concession, both of which must be present for a restructuring to meet the criteria of a TDR. If we determine that a TDR exists, we measure impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, we may also measure impairment based on a loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if the loan is a collateral-dependent loan.

Impaired Loans

A loan is considered impaired when, based upon currently known information, it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement. On a quarterly basis, we review our loan portfolio for impairment. Within each class of loans, we review individual loans for impairment based on credit risk ratings.  Loans risk-rated 5 through 7 are performing loans; however, we consider them as demonstrating higher risk, which requires more frequent review of the individual exposures; these translate to an internal rating of "Performing (Criticized)" and could be classified as a performing impaired loan.



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

For each loan identified as impaired, we measure the impairment based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. In limited circumstances, we may measure impairment based on the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent. Impaired collateral dependent loans will have independent appraisals completed and accepted at least annually. The fair value of the collateral will be determined by the most recent appraisal, as adjusted to reflect a reasonable marketing period for the sale of the asset(s) and an estimate of reasonable selling expenses.

If it is determined that the value of an impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, net of previous charge-offs and payments collected, we recognize impairment through the allowance for loan losses as determined by our analysis.

Nonaccrual Loans

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due as to principal or interest payments (unless the principal and interest are well secured and in the process of collection); or when we have determined, based upon currently known information, that the timely collection of principal or interest is not probable.

When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued interest and fees are reversed against interest income and the loan is accounted for using the cost recovery method thereafter until qualifying for return to accrual status. Historically, loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status have remained as nonaccrual loans until the loan is either charged-off, or the principal balances have been paid off. For a loan to be returned to accrual status, all delinquent principal and interest must become current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and future collection of remaining principal and interest must be deemed probable. We apply a cost recovery method in which all cash received is applied to the loan principal until it has been collected. Under this approach, interest income is recognized after total cash flows received exceed the recorded investment at the date of initial nonaccrual. All of our nonaccrual loans have credit risk ratings of 8 or 9 and are classified under the nonperforming impaired category.

Standby Letters of Credit

We recognize a liability at the inception of a standby letter of credit equivalent to the premium or the fee received for such guarantee. This fee is recognized in noninterest income over the commitment period using the straight-line method.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the related leases, whichever is shorter. The maximum estimated useful lives by asset classification are as follows:

We capitalize the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use, including costs related to developed software, purchased software licenses and certain implementation costs.

For property and equipment that is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in noninterest expense in consolidated net income.

Lease Obligations

We lease all of our properties. At the inception of the lease, each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease. For leases that contain rent escalations or landlord incentives, we record the total rent payable during the lease term, using the straight-line method over the term of the lease and record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight-line rent as lease obligations. We had no capitalized lease obligations at

Fair Value Measurements

Our available-for-sale securities, derivative instruments and certain marketable, non-marketable and other securities are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We make estimates regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing our consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurement-Definition and Hierarchy

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There is a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable and the significance of those inputs in the fair value measurement. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data and views of market participants. The three levels for measuring fair value are based on the reliability of inputs and are as follows:

Level 1

Fair value measurements based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these instruments does not entail a significant degree of judgment. Assets utilizing Level 1 inputs include U.S. Treasury securities, exchange-traded equity securities and certain marketable securities accounted for under fair value accounting.

Level 2

Fair value measurements based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, directly or indirectly. Valuations for the available-for-sale securities are provided by independent pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities and by comparison to and/or average of quoted market prices obtained from independent brokers. We perform a monthly analysis on the values received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The procedures include, but are not limited to, initial and ongoing review of third party pricing methodologies, review of pricing trends and monitoring of trading volumes. Additional corroboration, such as obtaining a non-binding price from a broker, may be obtained depending on the frequency of trades of the security and the level of liquidity or depth of the market. We ensure prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value through the use of observable market inputs including comparable trades, yield curve, spreads and, when available, market indices. As a result of this analysis, if the Company determines that there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data, the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly. Below is a summary of the significant inputs used for each class of Level 2 assets and liabilities:

U.S. agency debentures:

Fair value measurements of U.S. agency debentures are based on the characteristics specific to bonds held, such as issuer name, issuance date, coupon rate, maturity date and any applicable issuer call option features. Valuations are based on market spreads relative to similar term benchmark market interest rates, generally U.S. Treasury securities.

Agency-issued mortgage-backed securities:

Agency-issued mortgage-backed securities are pools of individual conventional mortgage loans underwritten to U.S. agency standards with similar coupon rates, tenor, and other attributes such as geographic location, loan size and origination vintage. Fair value measurements of these securities are based on observable price adjustments relative to benchmark market interest rates taking into consideration estimated loan prepayment speeds.

Agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations:

Agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations are structured into classes or tranches with defined cash flow characteristics and are collateralized by U.S. agency-issued mortgage pass-through securities. Fair value measurements of these securities incorporate similar characteristics of mortgage pass-through securities such as coupon rate, tenor, geographic location, loan size and origination vintage, in addition to incorporating the effect of estimated prepayment speeds on the cash flow structure of the class or tranche. These measurements incorporate observable market spreads over an estimated average life after considering the inputs listed above.

Agency-issued commercial mortgage-backed securities:

Fair value measurements of these securities are based on spreads to benchmark market interest rates (usually U.S. Treasury rates or rates observable in the swaps market), prepayment speeds, loan default rate assumptions and loan loss severity assumptions on underlying loans.



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Municipal bonds and notes:

Bonds issued by municipal governments generally have stated coupon rates, final maturity dates and are subject to being called ahead of the final maturity date at the option of the issuer. Fair value measurements of these securities are priced based on spreads to other municipal benchmark bonds with similar characteristics; or, relative to market rates on U.S. Treasury bonds of similar maturity.

Interest rate derivative assets and liabilities:

Fair value measurements of interest rate derivatives are priced considering the coupon rate of the fixed leg of the contract and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. Valuation is based on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve and the credit worthiness of the contract counterparty.

Foreign exchange forward and option contract assets and liabilities:

Fair value measurements of these assets and liabilities are priced based on spot and forward foreign currency rates and option volatility assumptions.

Equity warrant assets (public portfolio):

Fair value measurements of equity warrant assets of publicly-traded portfolio companies are valued based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model uses the price of publicly-traded companies (underlying stock price), stated strike prices, warrant expiration dates, the risk-free interest rate and market-observable option volatility assumptions.

Level 3

The fair value measurement is derived from valuation techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates of assumptions we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset. The valuation techniques are consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or the cost approach used to measure fair value. Below is a summary of the valuation techniques used for each class of Level 3 assets:

Other venture capital investments:

Fair value measurements are based on consideration of a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, and as it relates to the private company, the current and projected operating performance, exit strategies and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement include the information about each portfolio company, including actual and forecasted results, cash position, recent or planned transactions and market comparable companies. Significant changes to any one of these inputs in isolation could result in a significant change in the fair value measurement, however, we generally consider all factors available through ongoing communication with the portfolio companies and venture capital fund managers to determine whether there are changes to the portfolio company or the environment that indicate a change in the fair value measurement.

Other securities:

Fair value measurements of equity securities of public companies are priced based on quoted market prices less a discount if the securities are subject to certain sales restrictions. Certain sales restriction discounts generally range from

10%

to

20%

depending on the duration of the sale restrictions which typically range from three to six months.

Equity warrant assets (public portfolio):

Fair value measurements of equity warrant assets of publicly-traded portfolio companies are valued based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model uses the price of publicly-traded companies (underlying stock price), stated strike prices, warrant expiration dates, the risk-free interest rate and market-observable option volatility assumptions. Modeled asset values are further adjusted by applying a discount of up to

20%

for certain warrants that have certain sales restrictions or other features that indicate a discount to fair value is warranted. As sale restrictions are lifted, discounts are adjusted downward to zero once all restrictions expire or are removed.

Equity warrant assets (private portfolio):

Fair value measurements of equity warrant assets of private portfolio companies are priced based on a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the asset value by using stated strike prices, option expiration dates, risk-free interest rates and option volatility assumptions. Option volatility assumptions used in the modified Black-Scholes model are based on public market indices whose members operate in similar industries as companies in our private company portfolio. Option expiration dates are modified to account for estimates to actual life relative to stated expiration. Overall model asset values are further adjusted for a general lack of liquidity due to the private nature of the associated underlying company. There is a direct correlation between changes in the volatility and remaining life assumptions in isolation and the fair value measurement while there is an inverse correlation between changes in the liquidity discount assumption and the fair value measurement.

It is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. When available, we use quoted market prices to measure fair value. If market prices are not available, fair value measurement is based upon valuation approaches that use primarily market-based or independently-sourced market



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment speeds, option volatilities and currency rates. Substantially all of our financial instruments use the foregoing methodologies, and are categorized as a Level 1 or Level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. However, in certain cases, when market observable inputs for our valuation techniques may not be readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions we believe market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument, and based on the significance of those judgments, the measurement may be determined to be a Level 3 fair value measurement.

The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. For inactive markets, there is little information, if any, to evaluate if individual transactions are orderly. Accordingly, we are required to estimate, based upon all available facts and circumstances, the degree to which orderly transactions are occurring and provide more weighting to price quotes that are based upon orderly transactions. In addition, changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greater for financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3.

Fee-based Services Revenue Recognition

Letters of Credit and Standby Letters of Credit Fee Income

Fees generated from letters of credit and standby letters of credit are deferred as a component of other liabilities and recognized in noninterest income over the commitment period using the straight-line method, based on the likelihood that the commitment being drawn down will be remote.

Client Investment Fees

Client investment fees include fees earned from Rule 12(b)-1 fees, revenue sharing and from customer transactional based fees. Rule 12(b)-1 fees and revenue sharing are recognized as earned based on client funds that are invested in the period. Transactional based fees are earned and recognized on fixed income securities when the transaction is executed on the clients' behalf.

Foreign Exchange Fees

Foreign exchange fees represent the income differential between purchases and sales of foreign currency on behalf of our clients and are recognized as earned.

Lending Related Fees

Unused commitment fees, minimum finance fees and unused line fees are recognized as earned on a monthly and quarterly basis.  Fees that qualify for syndication treatment are recognized at the completion of the syndicated loan deal for which the fees were received.

Other Fee Income

Credit card fees, net of rewards expense, and deposit service charge fee income are recognized as earned on a monthly basis.

Other Service Revenue

Other service revenue primarily includes revenue from valuation services. We recognize revenue when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) we have performed the service, provided we have no other remaining obligations to the customer, (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable and, (iv) collectability is probable.



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

Fund Management Fees and Carried Interest

Fund management fees are comprised of fees charged directly to our managed funds of funds and direct venture funds. Fund management fees are based upon the contractual terms of the limited partnership agreements and are recognized as earned over the specified contract period, which is generally equal to the life of the individual fund.  Fund management fees are recorded as a component of other noninterest income.

Carried interest is comprised of preferential allocations of profits recognizable when the return on assets of our individual managed fund of funds and direct venture funds exceeds certain performance targets and is payable to us, as the general partners of the managed funds.  The carried interest we earn is often shared with employees, who are also members of the general partner entities.  We record carried interest on a quarterly basis by measuring fund performance to date versus the performance target.  For our unconsolidated managed funds, carried interest is recorded as gains on investment securities, net.  For our consolidated managed funds, it is recorded as a component of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.  Carried interest allocated to others is recorded as a component of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Any carried interest paid to us (or our employees) may be subject to reversal to the extent fund performance declines to a level where inception to date carried interest is lower than actual payments made by the funds.  The limited partnership agreements for our funds provide that carried interest is generally not paid to the general partners until the funds have provided a full return of contributed capital to the limited partners. Accrued, but unpaid carried interest may be subject to reversal to the extent that the fund performance declines to a level where inception to date carried interest is less than prior amounts recognized.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Our federal, state and foreign income tax provisions are based upon taxes payable for the current year, current year changes in deferred taxes related to temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement balances of assets and liabilities, and a reserve for uncertain tax positions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. We file a consolidated federal income tax return, and consolidated, combined, or separate state income tax returns as appropriate. Our foreign incorporated subsidiaries file tax returns in the applicable foreign jurisdictions. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other noninterest expense, a component of consolidated net income.

Share-Based Compensation

For all stock-based awards granted, stock-based compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, including consideration of vesting conditions and anticipated forfeitures. The fair value of stock options are measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common stock shares and potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of stock options, ESPP shares and restricted stock units. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if the effect is antidilutive.

Derivative Financial Instruments

All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative financial instrument depends on whether the derivative financial instrument is designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity. Changes in fair value are recognized through earnings for derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, or that have not been designated in a hedging relationship.

Fair Value Hedges

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in the statement of income in the same line item as the hedged item and is intended to offset the loss or gain on the

Equity Warrant Assets

In connection with negotiated credit facilities and certain other services, we may obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock in primarily private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science/healthcare industries. We hold these assets for prospective investment gains. We do not use them to hedge any economic risks nor do we use other derivative instruments to hedge economic risks stemming from equity warrant assets.

We account for equity warrant assets in certain private and public client companies as derivatives when they contain net settlement terms and other qualifying criteria under ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

. In general, equity warrant assets entitle us to buy a specific number of shares of stock at a specific price within a specific time period. Certain equity warrant assets contain contingent provisions, which adjust the underlying number of shares or purchase price upon the occurrence of certain future events. Our warrant agreements typically contain net share settlement provisions, which permit us to receive at exercise a share count equal to the intrinsic value of the warrant divided by the share price (otherwise known as a “cashless” exercise). These equity warrant assets are recorded at fair value and are classified as derivative assets, a component of other assets, on our consolidated balance sheet at the time they are obtained.

The grant date fair values of equity warrant assets received in connection with the issuance of a credit facility are deemed to be loan fees and recognized as an adjustment of loan yield through loan interest income. Similar to other loan fees, the yield adjustment related to grant date fair value of warrants is recognized over the life of that credit facility.

Any changes in fair value from the grant date fair value of equity warrant assets will be recognized as increases or decreases to other assets on our balance sheet and as net gains or losses on derivative instruments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. When a portfolio company completes an IPO on a publicly reported market or is acquired, we may exercise these equity warrant assets for shares or cash.

In the event of an exercise for shares, the basis or value in the securities is reclassified from other assets to investment securities on the balance sheet on the latter of the exercise date or corporate action date. The shares in public companies are classified as available-for-sale securities (provided they do not have a significant restriction from sale). Changes in fair value of securities designated as available-for-sale, after applicable taxes, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of SVBFG stockholders' equity. The shares in private companies are classified as non-marketable securities. Typically, we account for these securities at cost and only record adjustments to the value at the time of exit or liquidation though gains or losses on investments securities, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.

The fair value of the equity warrant assets portfolio is a critical accounting estimate and is reviewed quarterly. We value our equity warrant assets using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model, which incorporates the following significant inputs:

•

An underlying asset value, which is estimated based on current information available in valuation reports, including any information regarding subsequent rounds of funding or performance of a company.

•

Stated strike price, which can be adjusted for certain warrants upon the occurrence of subsequent funding rounds or other future events.

•

Price volatility or risk associated with possible changes in the warrant price. The volatility assumption is based on historical price volatility of publicly traded companies within indices similar in nature to the underlying client companies issuing the warrant. The actual volatility input is based on the mean and median volatility for an individual public company within an index for the past 16 quarters, from which an average volatility was derived.

•

Actual data on cancellations and exercises of our warrants are utilized as the basis for determining the expected remaining life of the warrants in each financial reporting period. Warrants may be exercised in the event of acquisitions, mergers or IPOs, and cancelled due to events such as bankruptcies, restructuring activities or additional financings. These events cause the expected remaining life assumption to be shorter than the contractual term of the warrants.

•

The risk-free interest rate is derived from the Treasury yield curve and is calculated based on a weighted average of the risk-free interest rates that correspond closest to the expected remaining life of the warrant.

•

Other adjustments, including a marketability discount, are estimated based on management's judgment about the general industry environment.

Foreign Exchange Forwards and Foreign Currency Option Contracts

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts with clients involved in international activities, either as the purchaser or seller, depending upon the clients' need. We also enter into an opposite-way forward or option contract with a correspondent bank to economically hedge client contracts to mitigate the fair value risk to us from fluctuations in currency rates. Settlement, credit and operational risks remain. We also enter into forward contracts with correspondent banks to economically hedge currency exposure risk related to certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. The contracts generally have terms of


year or less, although we may have contracts extending for up to


years. Generally, we have not experienced nonperformance on these contracts, have not incurred credit losses, and anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements.

Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized in consolidated net income under gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net, a component of noninterest income. Period-end gross positive fair values are recorded in other assets and gross negative fair values are recorded in other liabilities.

Interest Rate Contracts

We sell interest rate contracts to clients who wish to mitigate their interest rate exposure. We economically reduce the interest rate risk from this business by entering into opposite way contracts with correspondent banks. We do not designate any of these contracts (which are derivative instruments) as qualifying for hedge accounting. Contracts in an asset position are included in other assets and contracts in a liability position are included in other liabilities. The net change in the fair value of these derivatives is recorded through net gains on derivative instruments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

There were no new accounting standards adopted during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)), which provides revenue recognition guidance that is intended to create greater consistency with respect to how and when revenue from contracts with customers is shown in the income statement. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2018, either on a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted, but not before January 1, 2017. This guidance is not applicable to financial instruments and, therefore, is not expected to impact a majority of our revenue, which is primarily net interest income. We continue to evaluate the impact of this guidance to our noninterest income and on our presentation and disclosures.

In January 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Topic 825)), which will significantly change the income statement impact of equity investments, and the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities. This guidance will be effective on January 1, 2018, on a prospective basis with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. Upon adoption we expect to carry our cost method venture capital and private equity fund investments at fair value. The actual adjustment to opening retained earnings will depend upon the fair value of our investments at the adoption date.

In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)), which will require for all operating leases the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, in the statement of financial position. The lease cost will be allocated over the lease term on a straight-line basis. This guidance will be effective on January 1, 2019, on a modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt the lease accounting guidance in first quarter 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operation and stockholders’ equity.

In March 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)), which is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance by clarifying the following: how an entity should identify the unit of accounting for the principal versus agent evaluation; how the control principle applies to transactions, such as service



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

arrangements; reframes the indicators to focus on a principal rather than an agent, removes the credit risk and commission indicators and clarifies the relationship between the control principle and the indicators; and revises the existing illustrative examples and adds new illustrative examples. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2018, either on a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted, but not before January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operation and stockholders’ equity.

In March 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)), which includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. Under the ASU, an entity recognizes all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the period when the awards vest or are settled. The guidance also permits an entity to make an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. We plan to adopt the share-based payment guidance in first quarter 2017 and will continue to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest. Currently, we record excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to APIC at the time of vesting and/or settlement, however, upon adoption of this standard, the excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be recorded to the income statement as income tax expense or benefit. We do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our annual earnings; however, the impact will vary period to period depending on the volatility of the Company's stock price and the actual timing of vesting and/or settlement of awards. We would expect the most significant impact to occur during our second quarter as the majority of awards vest during that period. If this guidance would have been effective in 2016 and 2015 we would have recorded a reduction in income tax expense of approximately

$5.5 million

and

$11.7 million

in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The impact to our 2016 diluted EPS would have been

$0.10

higher and in 2015 our diluted EPS would have been

$0.23

higher. Since 2015, the highest quarterly EPS impact would have been

$0.15

during the second quarter of 2015 and the lowest quarterly EPS impact would have been

$0.00

during the third quarter of 2016.

In April 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing), which amends the new revenue recognition guidance on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations. The amendments clarify how an entity should evaluate the nature of its promise in granting a license of intellectual property, which will determine whether it recognizes revenue over time or a point in time. The amendments also clarify when a promised good or service is separately identifiable, that is distinct within the context of the contract, and allow entities to disregard items that are immaterial in the context of a contract. The effective date and transition requirements for this update are the same as those of the new standard. This guidance is effective January 1, 2018, on either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted, but not before January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operation and stockholders’ equity.

In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments), which amends the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2020, on a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted, but not before January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our financial position, results of operation and stockholders’ equity.

In August 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update (ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments), which clarifies the guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2018 on a full retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt the cash flow guidance in first quarter 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our statement of cash flows.

EPS

Basic EPS is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for stock option and restricted stock unit awards outstanding under our equity incentive plan and our ESPP. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of dilutive EPS in periods in which the effect would be antidilutive.

Equity Incentive Plan

Our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Incentive Plan”) was adopted in May 2006, and is amended from time to time. The 2006 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of various types of incentive awards, of which the following have been granted: (i) stock options; (ii) restricted stock awards; (iii) restricted stock units (subject to either time-and/or performance-based vesting); and (iv) other cash or stock settled equity awards. Eligible participants in the 2006 Incentive Plan include directors, employees and consultants.

Subject to the provisions of Section 16 of the 2006 Incentive Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be awarded and sold thereunder is

9,528,505

.

Restricted stock awards/units are counted against the available-for-issuance limits of the 2006 Incentive Plan as

two

shares for every one share awarded. Further, if shares acquired under any such award are forfeited, repurchased by SVB Financial, used to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an award, or otherwise canceled and would otherwise return to the 2006 Incentive Plan,

two

times the number of such shares will return to the 2006 Incentive Plan and will again become available for issuance.

Under the terms of the 2006 Incentive Plan and subject to certain exceptions: (i) restricted stock awards/units are subject to a minimum of at least

three

years of annual vesting, and (ii) performance-based restricted stock awards/units and stock options are subject to a minimum of at least

one

year of vesting.  Generally in practice, restricted stock awards/units vest annually over

four

years and require continued employment or other service through the vesting period.  Performance-based restricted stock awards/units granted to executives generally vest upon meeting certain performance-based objectives over a

three

year period and, typically the passage of time, and require continued employment or other service through the vesting period. Stock options vest annually over

four

years, from the grant date based on continued employment or other service, and expire no later than

seven

years after the grant date.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We maintain the 1999 ESPP under which participating employees may annually contribute up to

10 percent

of their gross compensation (not to exceed

$25,000

) to purchase shares of our common stock at

85 percent

of its fair market value at either the beginning or end of each six-month offering period, whichever price is less. To be eligible to participate in the ESPP, an employee must, among other requirements, be employed by the Company on both the date of offering and date of purchase, and be employed customarily for at least 20 hours per week and at least five months per calendar year. We issued

188,435

shares and received

$15.2 million

in cash under the ESPP in


. At

December 31, 2016

, a total of

1,737,293

shares of our common stock were still available for future issuance under the ESPP, which includes the stockholder approved increase of

1,500,000

shares to the ESPP plan reserve in April 2016.

Valuation Assumptions

The fair values of share-based awards for employee stock options and employee stock purchases made under our ESPP were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of restricted stock units were based on our closing stock price on the date of grant. The following weighted average assumptions and fair values were used for our employee stock options and restricted stock units:

The following weighted average assumptions and fair values were used for our ESPP:

The expected term is based on the implied term of the stock options using factors based on historical exercise behavior. The expected volatilities are based on a blended rate consisting of our historic volatility and our expected volatility over a

five

-year term which is an indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends. For

and


, expected volatilities for the ESPP were equal to the historical volatility for the previous six-month periods.

$112.4 million

and

$154.4 million

, respectively, and related unfunded commitments of

$58.1 million

and

$91.0 million

, respectively.

Non-marketable and other securities

Our non-marketable and other securities portfolio primarily represents investments in venture capital and private equity funds, debt funds, private and public portfolio companies and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. A majority of these investments are through third party funds held by SVB Financial in which we do not have controlling or significant variable interests. These investments represent our unconsolidated VIEs in the table above. Our non-marketable and other securities portfolio also includes investments from SVB Capital. SVB Capital is the venture capital investment arm of SVB Financial, which focuses primarily on funds management. The SVB Capital family of funds is comprised of direct venture funds that invest in companies and funds of funds that invest in other venture capital funds. We have a controlling and significant variable interest in

five

of these SVB Capital funds and consolidate these funds for financial reporting purposes.

All investments are generally non-redeemable and distributions are expected to be received through the liquidation of the underlying investments throughout the life of the investment fund. Investments may be sold or transferred subject to the notice and approval provisions of the underlying investment agreement. Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, including the Volcker Rule, we also make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, but are not obligated to fund commitments beyond our initial investment. For additional details, see

Note 18—"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

.

The Bank also has variable interests in qualified affordable housing projects tax credit funds, in connection with fulfilling its responsibilities under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"), that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits. These investments are typically limited partnerships in which the general partner, other than the Bank, holds the power over significant activities of the VIE. For additional information on our investments in qualified affordable housing projects see

Note 8—"Investment Securities" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

.

As of

December 31, 2016

, our exposure to loss with respect to the consolidated VIEs is limited to our net assets of

$207.4 million

and our exposure to loss for our unconsolidated VIEs is equal to our investment in these assets of

$314.8 million

Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses

We serve a variety of commercial clients in the technology, life science/healthcare, private equity/venture capital and premium wine industries. Our technology clients generally tend to be in the industries of hardware (semiconductors, communications and electronics), software and related services, and energy and resource innovation. Because of the diverse nature of ERI products and services, ERI-related loans are reported under our hardware, software and internet, life science/healthcare and other commercial loan categories, as applicable, for loan-related reporting. Our life science/healthcare clients primarily tend to be in the industries of biotechnology, medical devices, healthcare information technology and healthcare services. Loans made to private equity/venture capital firm clients typically enable them to fund investments prior to their receipt of funds from capital calls. Loans to the premium wine industry focus on vineyards and wineries that produce grapes and wines of high quality.

In addition to commercial loans, we make consumer loans through SVB Private Bank and provide real estate secured loans to eligible employees through our EHOP. Our private banking clients are primarily private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders in the innovation companies they support. These products and services include real estate secured home equity lines of credit, which may be used to finance real estate investments and loans used to purchase, renovate or refinance personal residences. These products and services also include restricted stock purchase loans and capital call lines of credit.

We also provide community development loans made as part of our responsibilities under the Community Reinvestment Act. These loans are included within “Construction loans” below and are primarily secured by real estate.

Credit Quality Indicators

For each individual client, we establish an internal credit risk rating for that loan, which is used for assessing and monitoring credit risk as well as performance of the loan and the overall portfolio. Our internal credit risk ratings are also used to summarize the risk of loss due to failure by an individual borrower to repay the loan. For our internal credit risk ratings, each individual loan is given a risk rating of 1 through 10. Loans risk-rated 1 through 4 are performing loans and translate to an internal rating of “Pass”, with loans risk-rated 1 being cash secured. Loans risk-rated 5 through 7 are performing loans, however, we consider them as demonstrating higher risk, which requires more frequent review of the individual exposures; these translate to an internal rating of “Performing (Criticized)”. When a significant payment delay occurs on a criticized loan, the loan is impaired. The loan is also considered for nonaccrual status if full repayment is determined to be improbable. All of our nonaccrual loans are risk-rated 8 or 9 and are classified under the nonperforming impaired category. (For a further description of nonaccrual loans, refer to

Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

). Loans rated 10 are charged-off and are not included as part of our loan portfolio balance. We review our credit quality indicators for performance and appropriateness of risk ratings as part of our evaluation process for our allowance for loan losses.

SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

The related allowance for loan losses for the majority of our TDRs is determined on an individual basis by comparing the carrying value of the loan to the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the pre-modification contractual interest rate. For certain TDRs, the related allowance for loan losses is determined based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

The following table summarizes the recorded investment in loans modified in TDRs within the previous 12 months that subsequently defaulted during their respective periods, broken out by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable.  During the 2014 year, there were no TDRs modified within the previous 12 months that defaulted.

Charge-offs and defaults on previously restructured loans are evaluated to determine the impact to the allowance for loan losses, if any. The evaluation of these defaults may impact the assumptions used in calculating the reserve on other TDRs and impaired loans as well as management’s overall outlook of macroeconomic factors that affect the reserve on the loan portfolio as a whole. After evaluating the charge-offs and defaults experienced on our TDRs we determined that no change to our reserving methodology was necessary to determine the allowance for loan losses as of

Derivative Financial Instruments

We primarily use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. Also, in connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock in private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science/healthcare industries.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is our primary market risk and can result from timing and volume differences in the repricing of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and changes in market interest rates.

To manage interest rate risk for our 6.05% Subordinated Notes, we entered into a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreement at the time of debt issuance based upon LIBOR with matched-terms.

Net cash benefits associated with our interest rate swap is recorded as a reduction in “Interest expense—Borrowings,” a component of net interest income. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is calculated using a discounted cash flow method and adjusted for credit valuation associated with counterparty risk. Changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are reflected in either other assets (for swaps in an asset position) or other liabilities (for swaps in a liability position).

We assess hedge effectiveness under ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, using the long-haul method. Any differences associated with our interest rate swaps that arise as a result of hedge ineffectiveness are recorded through net gains on derivative instruments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.

Currency Exchange Risk

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to economically reduce our foreign exchange exposure risk associated with the net difference between foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. We do not designate any foreign exchange forward contracts as derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting. Gains or losses from changes in currency rates on foreign currency denominated instruments are included in other noninterest income, a component of noninterest income. We may experience ineffectiveness in the economic hedging relationship, because the instruments are revalued based upon changes in the currency’s spot rate on the principal value, while the forwards are revalued on a discounted cash flow basis. We record forward agreements in gain positions in other assets and loss positions in other liabilities, while net changes in fair value are recorded through net gains on derivative instruments, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.

Other Derivative Instruments

Also included in our derivative instruments are equity warrant assets and client forward and option contracts, and client interest rate contracts. For further description of these other derivative instruments, refer to

Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

.

Counterparty Credit Risk

We are exposed to credit risk if counterparties to our derivative contracts do not perform as expected. We mitigate counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures and obtaining collateral, as appropriate. With respect to measuring counterparty credit risk for derivative instruments, we measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on a net risk basis by counterparty portfolio.

$4 million

at

Currently, we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from these net operating loss carryforwards, which are associated with our former eProsper business unit, part of SVB Analytics, and our UK operations, will not be realized in the near term due to uncertainties in the timing of future profitability in those businesses. In recognition of this, our valuation allowance is

$4 million

on the deferred tax assets related to these net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits at

December 31, 2016

Incentive Compensation Plan

Our Incentive Compensation Plan (“ICP”) is an annual cash incentive plan that rewards performance based on our financial results and other performance criteria. Awards are made based on company performance, the employee's target bonus level, and management's assessment of individual employee performance.



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan

The Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan (“Direct Drive”) is an annual sales cash incentive program. Awards are based on sales teams' performance as to predetermined financial targets and other company/individual performance criteria. Actual awards for each sales team member under Direct Drive are based on: (i) the actual results and financial performance with respect to the incentive gross profit targets; (ii) the sales team payout targets; and (iii) the sales team member's sales position and team payout allocation.

Retention Program

The Retention Program (“RP”) is a long-term incentive plan that allows designated employees to share directly in our investment success. Plan participants were granted an interest in the distributions of gains from certain designated investments made by us during the applicable year. Specifically, participants share in: (i) returns from designated investments made by us, including investments in certain venture capital and private equity funds, debt funds, and direct equity investments in companies; (ii) income realized from the exercise of, and the subsequent sale of shares obtained through the exercise of, warrants held by us; and (iii) other designated amounts as determined by us. Since 2009, no new participants have been added and no new investments have been designated to the plan.

Warrant Incentive Plan

The Warrant Incentive Plan provides individual and team awards to those employees who negotiate warrants on our behalf. Designated participants, as determined by the Company, share in the cash proceeds received by the Company from the exercise of equity warrant assets.

Deferred Compensation Plan

Under the Deferred Compensation Plan (the “DC Plan”), eligible employees may elect to defer up to

50 percent

of their base salary and/or up to

100 percent

of any eligible bonus payment to which they are entitled, for a period of


consecutive months, beginning January 1

st

and ending December 31

st

. Any amounts deferred under the DC Plan will be invested and administered by us (or such person we designate). We do not match employee deferrals to the DC Plan. From time to time, we may also offer deferred special retention incentives under this plan to key plan participants. The deferred incentives are eligible for investment in the DC Plan during the retention qualifying period.

Voluntary deferrals under the DC Plan were

401(k) and ESOP

The 401(k) Plan and ESOP, collectively referred to as the “Plan”, is a combined 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan and employee stock ownership plan in which all regular U.S. employees are eligible to participate.

Employees participating in the 401(k) Plan are allowed to contribute up to

75 percent

of their pre-tax pay as defined in the Plan, up to the maximum annual amount allowable under federal income tax regulations of

$18,000

for the years 2016 and 2015, and

$17,500

for 2014. We match the employee's contributions dollar-for-dollar, up to

five percent

of the employee's pre-tax pay as defined in the Plan. Our matching contributions vest immediately. The amount of salary deferred, up to the allowed maximum, is not subject to federal or state income taxes at the time of deferral.

Discretionary ESOP contributions, based on our company performance, are made by us to all eligible individuals employed by us on the last day of the fiscal year. We may elect to contribute cash or our common stock (or a combination of cash and stock), in an amount not exceeding

ten percent

of the employee's eligible pay earned in the fiscal year. The ESOP contributions vest in equal annual increments over a participant's first

five

years of service (thereafter, all subsequent ESOP contributions are fully vested).

EHOP

The EHOP is a benefit plan that provides for the issuance of mortgage loans at favorable interest rates to eligible employees. Eligible employees may apply for a fixed-rate mortgage for their primary residence, which is due and payable in either

five

or

seven

years and is based on amortization over a


year period. Applicants must qualify for a loan through the normal mortgage review and approval process, which is typical of industry standards. The maximum loan amount generally cannot be greater than



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

80 percent

of the lesser of the purchase price or the appraised value. The interest rate on the loan is written at the then market rate for five year (5/1) or seven year (7/1) mortgage loans as determined by us. However, provided that the applicant continues to meet all the eligibility requirements, including employment, the actual rate charged to the borrower shall be up to

two percent

Commitments to Extend Credit

A commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement. Such commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, or other termination clauses, and usually require a fee paid by the client upon us issuing the commitment. The following table summarizes information related to our commitments to extend credit at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively:

(1)

Represents commitments which are available for funding, due to clients meeting all collateral, compliance and financial covenants required under loan commitment agreements.

(2)

See below for additional information on our commercial and standby letters of credit.

(3)

Represents commitments which are currently unavailable for funding due to clients failing to meet all collateral, compliance and financial covenants under loan commitment agreements.

(4)

We extend credit under accounts receivable factoring arrangements when our clients’ sales invoices are deemed creditworthy under existing underwriting practices.

(5)

Our reserve for unfunded credit commitments includes an allowance for both our unfunded loan commitments and our letters of credit.

Our potential exposure to credit loss for commitments to extend credit, in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument, is the contractual amount of the available unused loan commitment. We use the same credit approval and monitoring process in extending credit commitments as we do in making loans. The actual liquidity needs and the credit risk that we have experienced have historically been lower than the contractual amount of commitments to extend credit because a significant portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. We evaluate each potential borrower and the necessary collateral on an individual basis. The type of collateral varies, but may include real property, intellectual property, bank deposits, or business and personal assets. The credit risk associated with these commitments is considered in the reserve for unfunded credit commitments.

Commercial and Standby Letters of Credit

Commercial and standby letters of credit represent conditional commitments issued by us on behalf of a client to guarantee the performance of the client to a third party when certain specified future events have occurred. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily for inventory purchases by a client and are typically short-term in nature. We provide two types of standby letters of credit: performance and financial standby letters of credit. Performance standby letters of credit are issued to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party when certain specified future events have occurred and are primarily used to support performance instruments such as bid bonds, performance bonds, lease obligations, repayment of loans, and past due notices. Financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the payment by a client to a third party (beneficiary) and are primarily used to support many types of domestic and international payments. These standby letters of credit have fixed expiration dates and generally require a fee to be paid by the client at the time we issue the commitment. Fees generated from these standby letters of credit are recognized in noninterest income over the commitment period using the straight-line method.

The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with extending credit commitments to clients, and accordingly, we use a credit evaluation process and collateral requirements similar to those for credit commitments.



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Our standby letters of credit often are cash secured by our clients. The actual liquidity needs and the credit risk that we have experienced historically have been lower than the contractual amount of letters of credit issued because a significant portion of these conditional commitments expire without being drawn upon.

The table below summarizes our commercial and standby letters of credit at

December 31, 2016

. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the amount that could be remitted under letters of credit if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from the collateral held or pledged.

Commitments to Invest in Venture Capital and Private Equity Funds

We make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, which in turn make investments generally in, or in some cases make loans to, privately-held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally made for a


-year period from the inception of the fund. Although the limited partnership agreements governing these investments typically do not restrict the general partners from calling

100%

of committed capital in one year, it is customary for these funds to generally call most of the capital commitments over


to


years; however in certain cases, the funds may not call

100%

of committed capital over the life of the fund. The actual timing of future cash requirements to fund these commitments is generally dependent upon the investment cycle, overall market conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held companies operate. The following table details our total capital commitments, unfunded capital commitments, and our ownership percentage in each fund at

December 31, 2016

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair Value Measurements

Our available-for-sale securities, derivative instruments and certain non-marketable and other securities are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We make estimates regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing our consolidated financial statements. We disclose our method and approach for fair value measurements of assets and liabilities in

Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

Unrealized gains are recorded on the line item “gains on investment securities, net”, a component of noninterest income.

(2)

Unrealized gains are recorded on the line item “gains on derivative instruments, net”, a component of noninterest income.

The extent to which any unrealized gains or losses will become realized is subject to a variety of factors, including, among other things, the expiration of current sales restrictions to which these securities are subject, the actual sales of securities and the timing of such actual sales.

The following table presents quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used for certain of our Level 3 fair value measurements at

December 31, 2016

and


. We have not included in this table our venture capital and private equity fund investments (fair value accounting) as we use net asset value per share (as obtained from the general partners of the investments) as a practical expedient to determine fair value.

(1)

In determining the fair value of our other venture capital investment portfolio, we evaluate a variety of factors related to each underlying private portfolio company including, but not limited to, actual and forecasted results, cash position, recent or planned transactions and market comparable companies. Additionally, we have ongoing communication with the portfolio companies and venture capital fund managers, to determine whether there is a material change in fair value. We



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

use company provided valuation reports, if available, to support our valuation assumptions. These factors are specific to each portfolio company and a weighted average or range of values of the unobservable inputs is not meaningful.

(2)

We adjust quoted market prices of public companies which are subject to certain sales restrictions. Sales restriction discounts generally range from

10 percent

to

20 percent

depending on the duration of the sales restrictions which typically range from

three

to

six

months.

(3)

Our marketability discount is applied to all private company warrants to account for a general lack of liquidity due to the private nature of the associated underlying company. The quantitative measure used is based on long-run averages and is influenced over time by various factors, including market conditions. On a quarterly basis, a sensitivity analysis is performed on our marketability discount.

(4)

We adjust the contractual remaining term of private company warrants based on our best estimate of the actual remaining life, which we determine by utilizing historical data on cancellations and exercises. At

December 31, 2016

, the weighted average contractual remaining term was

5.9

years, compared to our estimated remaining life of

2.6

years. On a quarterly basis, a sensitivity analysis is performed on our remaining life assumption.

During

there were no transfers between Level 2 and Level 1. During 2016 and 2015, there were no transfers in our other venture capital investments from Level 3 to Level 2. Transfers of our non-marketable and other securities from Level 3 to Level 2 for


included

$380.1 million

as a result of the expiration of lock-up, and other sales restrictions on certain of our other securities and venture capital investments.

All other transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 during

were due to the transfer of equity warrant assets from our private portfolio to our public portfolio (see our Level 3 reconciliation above). All amounts reported as transfers represent the fair value as of the date of the change in circumstances that caused the transfer.

Financial Instruments not Carried at Fair Value

FASB guidance over financial instruments requires that we disclose estimated fair values for our financial instruments not carried at fair value. Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth below for our financial instruments, are made solely to comply with these requirements.

Fair values are based on estimates or calculations at the transaction level using present value techniques in instances where quoted market prices are not available. As broadly traded markets do not exist for many of our financial instruments, the fair value calculations attempt to incorporate the effect of current market conditions at a specific time. The aggregation of the fair value calculations presented herein does not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of the Company.

The following describes the methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value and assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and excludes financial instruments and assets and liabilities already recorded at fair value as described above.

Financial Instruments for which Carrying Value Approximates Fair Value

Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and cash equivalents; FHLB and FRB stock; accrued interest receivable; short-term borrowings; short-term time deposits; and accrued interest payable. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.

Estimated Fair Values of Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Held-to-Maturity Securities

Held-to-maturity securities include similar investments held in our available-for-sale securities portfolio and are valued using the same methodologies.  All securities included in our held-to-maturity securities portfolio are valued using Level 2 inputs.  Refer to Level 2 fair value measurements in

Note 2—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" under Part II, Item 8 of this report

for significant inputs used in the valuation of our held-to-maturity investment securities.

Non-Marketable (Cost and Equity Method Accounting)



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Non-marketable securities includes other investments (equity method accounting), venture capital and private equity fund investments (cost method accounting) and other venture capital investments (cost method accounting). Other investments (equity method accounting) includes our investment in SPD-SVB, our joint venture bank in China. At this time, the carrying value of our investment in SPD-SVB is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of the remaining other investments (equity method accounting) and the fair value of venture capital and private equity fund investments (cost method accounting) and other venture capital investments (cost method accounting) is based on financial information obtained from the investee or obtained from the fund investments’ or debt fund investments’ respective general partners. For private company investments, estimated fair value is based on consideration of a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, exit strategies, and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. For our fund investments, we utilize the net asset value per share as obtained from the general partners of the investments. We adjust the net asset value per share for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment’s net asset value by using the most recently available financial information from the investee general partner, for example

September 30

th

, for our December 31

st

consolidated financial statements, adjusted for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and significant fund transactions or market events during the reporting period.

Loans

The fair value of fixed and variable rate loans is estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using rates that reflect current pricing for similar loans and the projected forward yield curve. This method is not based on the exit price concept of fair value required under ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

.

Long-Term Deposits

The fair value of long-term time deposits is estimated by discounting the cash flows using our cost of borrowings and the projected forward yield curve over their remaining contractual term.

Long-Term Debt

The fair value of long-term debt is generally based on quoted market prices, when available, or is estimated based on calculations utilizing third party pricing services and current market spread, price indications from reputable dealers or observable market prices of the underlying instrument(s), whichever is deemed more reliable. Also included in the estimated fair value of our

6.05%

Subordinated Notes are amounts related to hedge accounting associated with the notes.

Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments

The fair value of net available commitments to extend credit is estimated based on the average amount we would receive or pay to execute a new agreement with identical terms and pricing, while taking into account the counterparties’ credit standings.

Letters of credit are carried at their fair value, which is equivalent to the residual premium or fee at

December 31, 2016

Investments in Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share

FASB guidance over certain fund investments requires that we disclose the fair value of funds, significant investment strategies of the investees, redemption features of the investees, restrictions on the ability to sell investments, estimate of the period of time over which the underlying assets are expected to be liquidated by the investee, and unfunded commitments related to the investments.

Our investments in debt funds and venture capital and private equity fund investments generally cannot be redeemed. Alternatively, we expect distributions, if any, to be received primarily through IPOs and M&A activity of the underlying assets of the fund. Subject to applicable requirements under the Volcker Rule, we do not have any plans to sell any of these fund investments. If we decide to sell these investments in the future, the investee fund’s management must approve of the buyer before the sale of the investments can be completed. The fair values of the fund investments have been estimated using the net asset value per share of the investments, adjusted for any differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment’s net asset value by using the most recently available financial information from the investee general partner, for example

September 30

Regulatory Matters

SVB Financial and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board and the California Department of Business Oversight - Division of Financial Institutions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) required that the federal regulatory agencies adopt regulations defining five capital categories for banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Quantitative measures, established by the regulators to ensure capital adequacy, require that SVB Financial and the Bank maintain minimum ratios (set forth in the table below) of capital to risk-weighted assets. Effective January 1, 2015, SVB Financial Group and the Bank became subject to a regulatory capital measure called "Common Equity Tier 1" and a related regulatory capital ratio of CET 1 to risk-weighted assets implemented under "Basel III" regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.

There are three categories of capital under the new Basel III standards; CET 1, additional Tier 1 and Tier 2.  CET 1 includes common stock plus related surplus and retained earnings, less certain deductions. Additional Tier 1 capital includes qualifying preferred stock and trust preferred securities, less certain deductions.  Additional Tier 1, together with CET 1, equal total Tier 1 capital. Tier 2 capital includes primarily certain qualifying unsecured subordinated debt and qualifying allowances for loan and lease losses.  Tier 1 capital together with Tier 2 capital equal total capital.

As of

December 31, 2016

, both SVB Financial and the Bank were considered “well-capitalized” for regulatory purposes under existing capital guidelines.  There are no conditions or events since that date that management believes would have a material impact on that capital category.

Segment Reporting

We have

three

reportable segments for management reporting purposes: Global Commercial Bank, SVB Private Bank and SVB Capital. The results of our operating segments are based on our internal management reporting process.

Our Global Commercial Bank and SVB Private Bank segments’ primary source of revenue is from net interest income, which is primarily the difference between interest earned on loans, net of funds transfer pricing and interest paid on deposits, net of FTP. Accordingly, these segments are reported using net interest income, net of FTP. FTP is an internal measurement framework designed to assess the financial impact of a financial institution’s sources and uses of funds. It is the mechanism by which an earnings credit is given for deposits raised, and an earnings charge is made for funded loans. FTP is calculated at an instrument level based on account characteristics.

We also evaluate performance based on provision for loan losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense, which are presented as components of segment operating profit or loss. In calculating each operating segment’s noninterest expense, we consider the direct costs incurred by the operating segment as well as certain allocated direct costs. As part of this review, we



SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

allocate certain corporate overhead costs to a corporate account. We do not allocate income taxes to our segments. Additionally, our management reporting model is predicated on average asset balances; therefore, period-end asset balances are not presented for segment reporting purposes. Changes in an individual client’s primary relationship designation have resulted, and in the future may result, in the inclusion of certain clients in different segments in different periods.

Unlike financial reporting, which benefits from the comprehensive structure provided by GAAP, our internal management reporting process is highly subjective, as there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our management reporting process measures the performance of our operating segments based on our internal operating structure, which is subject to change from time to time, and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial services companies. For reporting purposes, SVB Financial Group has three operating segments for which we report our financial information (for further description of these reportable segments, refer to "Business–Business Overview" under Part I, Item 1 of this report):

•

Global Commercial Bank

is comprised of results from the following:

Our clients are primarily private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders of the innovation companies they support. We offer a customized suite of private banking services, including mortgages, home equity lines of credit, restricted stock purchase loans, capital call lines of credit and other secured and unsecured lending products, as well as cash and wealth management services.

SVB Capital manages funds (primarily venture capital funds) on behalf of third party limited partners and, on a more limited basis, SVB Financial Group. The SVB Capital family of funds is comprised of direct venture funds that invest in companies and funds of funds that invest in other venture capital funds. SVB Capital generates income for the Company primarily from investment returns (including carried interest) and management fees.

The summary financial results of our operating segments are presented along with a reconciliation to our consolidated results.

The "Other Items" column reflects the adjustments necessary to reconcile the results of the operating segments to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. Net interest income consists primarily of interest earned from our fixed income investment portfolio, net of FTP. Noninterest income consists primarily of gains on equity warrant assets and gains on the sale of fixed income securities. Noninterest expense consists primarily of expenses associated with corporate support functions such as finance, human resources, marketing, legal and other expenses. Amounts for the year ended December 31, 2014 have not been revised for the adoption of accounting guidance related to our consolidated variable interest entities.

Legal Matters

Certain lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed or are pending against us and/or our affiliates, and we may from time to time be involved in other legal or regulatory proceedings. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we establish accruals for all such matters, including expected settlements, when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, we do not establish an accrual. Any such loss estimates are inherently uncertain, based on currently available information and are subject to management’s judgment and various assumptions. Due to the inherent subjectivity of these estimates and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate resolution of such matters.

To the extent we believe any potential loss relating to such matters may have a material impact on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or our business as a whole and is reasonably possible but not probable, we aim to disclose information relating to such potential loss. We also aim to disclose information relating to any material potential loss that is probable but not reasonably estimable. In such cases, where reasonably practicable, we aim to provide an estimate of loss or range of potential loss. No disclosures are generally made for any loss contingencies that are deemed to be remote.

Based upon information available to us, our review of lawsuits and claims filed or pending against us to date and consultation with our outside legal counsel, we have not recognized a material accrual liability for any such matters, nor do we currently expect that these matters will result in a material liability to the Company. However, the outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that one or more of such matters currently pending or threatened could have an unanticipated material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or our business as a whole, in the future.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, among other things, processes, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of

December 31, 2016

, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

December 31, 2016

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting at the Company. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, transactions and dispositions of the company's assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and the directors of the company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company carried out an assessment, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15(c), as adopted by the SEC under the Exchange Act. In evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, management used the framework established in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013),” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of

December 31, 2016

, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.



KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, is included below under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.”

(c)    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation during the fourth quarter of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

SVB Financial Group:

We have audited SVB Financial Group and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

(Item 9A(b)). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, and our report dated February 28, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
