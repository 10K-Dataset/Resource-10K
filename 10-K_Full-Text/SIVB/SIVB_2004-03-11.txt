PART I

ITEM 1.
BUSINESS

General

Silicon Valley Bancshares is a bank holding company
and a financial holding company. Our principal subsidiary, Silicon Valley Bank,
is a California state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve
System. Silicon Valley Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. Our corporate headquarters is located at 3003 Tasman
Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054 and our telephone number is 408.654.7400.
When we refer to “Silicon Valley Bancshares,” or “we” or use similar words, we
intend to include Silicon Valley Bancshares and all of its subsidiaries
collectively, including Silicon Valley Bank. When we refer to “Bancshares,” we
are referring only to the parent company, Silicon Valley Bancshares.

For over 20 years, we have been dedicated to helping
entrepreneurs succeed, specifically focusing on industries where we have deep
knowledge and relationships. Our focus remains on the technology, life science,
private equity, and premium wine niches. In 2003, we continued to diversify our
services to support our clients throughout their life cycles, regardless of
their age or size. We offer a range of financial services that generate three
distinct sources of income.

In part, our income is generated from interest rate
differentials. The difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing
liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates
received on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to clients
and securities held in our investment portfolio, accounts for the major portion
of our earnings. Our deposits are largely obtained from clients within our
technology, life science, and premium winery industry sectors, and, to a lesser
extent, from individuals served by our private banking division. We do not
obtain deposits from conventional retail sources and have no brokered deposits.
As part of negotiated credit facilities, we frequently obtain rights to acquire
stock in the form of warrants in certain client companies.

Fee-based services also generate income for the
company. We market our full range of financial services to clients and private
equity firms including venture capitalists. In addition to our commercial and
personal banking services, we offer fee-based merger and acquisition
services, private placements, and investment and advisory services. Our ability
to integrate and cross-sell our diverse financial services to our clients
is a strength of our business model.

In addition, we seek to obtain equity returns through
investments in direct private equity and venture capital fund investments. We
also manage two limited partnerships: a venture capital fund and a fund that
invests in venture capital funds.

We serve over 9,500 clients
nationwide and have venture capital relationships in over 20 countries around
the world. To deliver high quality, localized service we have 13 offices
throughout California and operate 26 regional offices across the country in
Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North
Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. Our focus on
the technology, life sciences, and premium winery markets and our extensive
knowledge of the people and business issues driving them, provide a level of service
and partnership that contributes to our clients’ success.

Business Overview

Silicon Valley Bancshares is
organized by groups, which manage the diverse financial services we offer:

Commercial Banking

We provide domestic and international cash management
services including deposit services, collection services, disbursement
services, electronic funds transfers, and online banking through SVBeConnect. Our
lending services include traditional term loans, commercial finance lending,
and structured finance lending. Global financial services that we provide
include global treasury, global trade, foreign exchange and global finance.


Investment services are provided
through our broker-dealer, SVB Securities, which offers mutual funds and
fixed income securities. SVB Asset Management provides investment advisory
services.

Merchant Banking

We provide banking services to
private equity and venture capital firms, make direct private equity and
venture capital fund investments, establish and maintain international alliances
with venture capital firms, and manage two limited partnerships: a venture
capital fund and a fund that invests in venture capital funds.

Investment Banking

We offer merger and acquisition,
corporate partnering and advisory services through our subsidiary, Alliant
Partners. In October 2003, Alliant launched a Private Capital Group and
began offering advisory services for the private placement of securities.

Private Banking

Through the SVB Private Bank we
provide a wide array of loans, personal asset management, mortgage services,
and trust and estate planning tailored for high-net-worth
individuals. We also provide investment advisory services to these clients
through our subsidiary, Woodside Asset Management, Inc. In January 2004,
our Private Banking division changed its name to “Private Client Services
Group.”

Industry Niches

In each of the industry niches we
serve, we have developed services to meet the needs of our clients throughout
their life cycles, from early stage through maturity.

Technology and Life Science

We serve a variety of clients in the technology and
life science industries. A key component of our technology and life science
business strategy is to develop relationships with clients at an early stage
and offer them banking services that will continue to meet their needs as they
mature and expand.

Our early stage clients generally keep large cash
balances in their deposit accounts and usually do not borrow large amounts
under their credit facilities. The primary source of funding for most early
stage clients is equity from venture capitalists and public markets. Lending to
this market typically involves working capital lines of credit, equipment
financing, asset acquisition loans, and bridge financing between funding
rounds.

With an extended suite of financial services, we have
successfully expanded our business to more mature companies. Our Corporate
Technology practice is a network of senior lenders in every geographic region
in which we operate, focused solely on the specific financial needs of mature
private and public clients. Today, we can comfortably address the financial
needs of all companies in our niches, whether they are entrepreneurs with
innovative ideas or multinational corporations with hundreds of millions of
dollars in sales.

Our technology and life
science clients generally fall into the following industries:

·

Hardware:
Semiconductors, Communications and Electronics

·

Software:
Software and Services

·

Biotechnology

·

Drug
Discovery

·

Medical
Devices

·

Specialty
Pharmaceuticals

Private Equity

Through our Merchant Banking
division, we have cultivated strong relationships with venture capital firms
worldwide, many of which are also clients. Our Private Equity Services group
provides financial


services to
over half of the venture capital firms in the U.S. as well as other private
equity firms, facilitating deal flow to and from these private equity firms,
and participating in direct investments in their portfolio companies.

Premium Wine

Our premium wineries practice has
become the leading provider of financial services to the U.S. premium wine
industry. We focus on vineyards and wineries that produce grapes and wines of
the highest quality.

Industry Niches Exited

In keeping with our strategic focus on the technology,
life science, private equity and premium wine industries, we exited three
niches in late 2002: real estate, media, and religious lending. While we will
continue to service our existing real estate, media and religious niche loans
until they are paid-off, we expect our refined strategic focus on more
profitable aspects of our core business will help improve overall
profitability.

For further information on our
business segments, see “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Segment
Reporting.”

Business Combinations

On October 1, 2002, we acquired substantially all
of the assets of Woodside Asset Management, Inc., an investment advisor firm,
which has approximately $200 million under management for 70 clients. We are
offering Woodside Asset Management’s services as part of our private banking
services. Additionally, as part of this acquisition, Silicon Valley Bancshares
obtained the general partner interests in two limited partnerships, Taurus Growth
Partners, L.P. and Libra Partners, L.P., with total assets aggregating $12.3
million as of December 31, 2003. We have less than a 1% ownership interest
in each of these funds. The remaining ownership interest represents limited
partners’ funds invested on their behalf by the general partner in certain
fixed income and marketable equity securities. However, due to our ability to
control the investing activities of these limited partnerships, we have
consolidated the related results of operations and financial condition into our
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2003. This acquisition did not have a material impact on goodwill and is not
expected to materially impact our earnings in the short term.

On September 28, 2001, a
subsidiary of Silicon Valley Bank, SVB Securities, Inc., completed the
acquisition of Alliant Partners, an investment banking firm providing merger
and acquisition and corporate partnering services. Our investment banking
business continues to do business under the name “Alliant Partners.” See “Item 8.
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements—Business Combinations.” On October 1,
2002, Alliant Partners was sold from our Silicon Valley Bank subsidiary to the
Silicon Valley Bancshares parent company. This transfer allowed Alliant
Partners to operate under less restrictive bank holding company regulations and
increased our capital ratios at Silicon Valley Bank.

Competition

The banking and financial
services industry is highly competitive, and evolves as a result of changes in
regulation, technology, product delivery systems, and the general market and
economic climate. Our current competitors include other banks and specialty and
diversified financial services companies that offer lending, leasing, other
financial products, and advisory services to our client base. The principal
competitive factors in our markets include product offerings, service and
pricing. Given our established market position with the client segments that we
serve, we believe we compete favorably in all our markets in these areas.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, we
employed approximately 969 full-time equivalent employees. None of our
employees are represented by a labor union. Competition for qualified personnel
in our industry is significant, particularly for client relationship manager
positions, officers, and employees with strong


relationships
with the venture capital community. Our future success will depend in part on
our continued ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel.

Supervision and Regulation

General

Our operations are subject to
extensive regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies. As a bank
holding company, Silicon Valley Bancshares is subject to the Federal Reserve
Board’s supervision, regulation, examination and reporting requirements under
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHC Act”). Silicon Valley Bancshares has
also qualified and elected to be treated as a financial holding company under
the BHC Act. Silicon Valley Bank, as a California-chartered bank and a
member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to primary supervision and
examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the California
Department of Financial Institutions. Both Silicon Valley Bancshares and
Silicon Valley Bank are required to file periodic reports with these regulators
and provide any additional information that they may require. The following
summary describes some of the more significant laws, regulations and policies
that affect our operations, and is not intended to be a complete listing of all
laws that apply to us. Any change in the statutes, regulations, or policies
that apply to our operations may have a material effect on our business.

Regulation of Holding Company

The Federal Reserve Board
requires Silicon Valley Bancshares to maintain minimum capital ratios, as
discussed below in “Regulatory Capital.” Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a
bank holding company is also required to serve as a source of financial and
managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations
in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the Federal Reserve Board’s
policy that in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank
holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide
adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial
stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising
capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A
bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of
strength to its subsidiary banks or to observe established guidelines with
respect to the payment of dividends by bank holding companies will generally be
considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking
practice, or a violation of the Federal Reserve Board’s regulations, or both.

Prior to becoming a financial
holding company, Bancshares was required under the BHC Act to seek the prior
approval of the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring direct or indirect
ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of
voting securities, or substantially all of the assets, of any bank, bank
holding company or nonbank company. In addition, prior to becoming a financial
holding company, Bancshares was generally limited under the BHC Act to
engaging, directly or indirectly, only in the business of banking or managing or
controlling banks and other activities that were deemed by the Federal Reserve
Board to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act of 1999 (“GLB Act”) amended the BHC Act to permit a qualifying bank holding
company, called a financial holding company, to engage in a broader range of
activities than those traditionally permissible for bank holding companies. A
financial holding company may conduct activities that are “financial in nature,”
including insurance, securities underwriting and dealing and market-making, and
merchant banking activities, as well as additional activities that the Federal
Reserve Board determines (in the case of incidental activities, in conjunction
with the Treasury Department) are incidental or complementary to financial
activities, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. The GLB
Act also permits financial holding companies to acquire companies engaged in
activities that are financial in nature or that are incidental or complementary
to financial activities without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
The GLB Act also repealed the provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act that
restricted banks and securities firms from affiliating. On November 14,
2000, Silicon Valley Bancshares became a financial holding company. As a financial holding company, Silicon
Valley Bancshares no longer requires
the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to conduct, or to acquire
ownership or control of entities engaged in, activities that are financial in
nature or activities that are determined to be incidental or complementary to
financial activities, although the requirement in the BHC


Act for prior Federal Reserve Board approval for the acquisition by a
bank holding company of more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of a
bank or savings association (or the holding company of either) is still
applicable. Additionally, under the merchant banking authority added by the GLB
Act, Bancshares may invest in companies that engage in activities that are not
otherwise permissible, subject to certain limitations, including that
Bancshares make the investment with the intention of limiting the investment in
duration and does not manage the company on a day-to-day basis.

To qualify as a financial holding
company, a bank holding company’s subsidiary depository institutions must be
well capitalized (as discussed below in “Regulatory Capital”) and have at least
“satisfactory” composite, managerial and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) examination
ratings. A bank holding company that does not satisfy the criteria for
financial holding company status is limited to activities that were permissible
under the BHC Act prior to the enactment of the GLB Act. A financial holding
company that does not continue to meet all of the requirements for financial
holding company status will, depending upon which requirements it fails to
meet, lose the ability to undertake new activities or acquisitions that are not
generally permissible for bank holding companies or to continue such
activities.

Silicon Valley Bancshares is also
treated as a bank holding company under the California Financial Code. As such,
Silicon Valley Bancshares and its subsidiaries are subject to periodic
examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the California
Department of Financial Institutions.

Regulatory Capital

The federal banking agencies have
adopted minimum risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies
and banks intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of
risk associated with a banking organization’s operations for both transactions
reported on the balance sheet as assets and those recorded as off-balance
sheet items. These include transactions such as commitments, letters of credit,
and recourse arrangements. Under these guidelines, dollar amounts of assets and
credit-equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are adjusted
by one of several conversion factors and/or risk adjustment percentages. The
Federal Reserve Board requires bank holding companies and state member banks
generally to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-adjusted
assets of 8% (10% to be well capitalized). At least half of total capital must
consist of items such as common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock, minority interests (including trust preferred
securities) and, for bank holding companies, a limited amount of qualifying
cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less most intangibles including goodwill
(“Tier 1 capital”). The remainder (“Tier 2 capital”) may consist of other
preferred stock, certain other instruments, and limited amounts of subordinated
debt and the loan and lease allowance. Not more than 25% of qualifying Tier 1
capital may consist of trust preferred securities. In order to be well
capitalized, a bank holding company must have a minimum ratio of Tier 1
capital to risk-adjusted assets of 6%. The Federal Reserve Board also
requires Bancshares and Silicon Valley Bank to maintain a minimum amount of
Tier 1 capital to total average assets, referred to as the Tier 1
leverage ratio. For a bank holding company or a bank that meets certain
specified criteria, including those in the highest of the five categories used
by regulators to rate banking organizations, the minimum Tier 1 leverage
ratio is 3%. All other institutions are required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage
ratio of at least 3% plus an additional cushion of 100 to 200 basis points (or
at least 5% to be well capitalized). In addition to these requirements, the
Federal Reserve Board may set individual minimum capital requirements for
specific institutions at rates substantially above the minimum guidelines and
ratios. Under certain circumstances, Silicon Valley Bancshares must file
written notice with, and obtain approval from, the Federal Reserve Board prior
to purchasing or redeeming its equity securities. See “Item 1.
Business—Supervision and Regulation—Prompt Corrective Action and Other
Enforcement Mechanisms” for additional discussion of capital ratios.

The ability of Silicon Valley
Bancshares, like other bank holding companies, to continue to include its
outstanding Trust Preferred Securities in Tier 1 capital has been made the
subject of some doubt due to the issuance by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) in January 2003 of Interpretation No. 46 “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities (VIE),” and in May 2003 of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,”
although the Federal Reserve Board announced in July 2003 that qualifying
Trust Preferred Securities will continue to be treated as Tier 1 capital until
notice is given to the contrary.


Silicon Valley Bancshares and
Silicon Valley Bank are also subject to rules that govern the regulatory
capital treatment of equity investments in nonfinancial companies made on or
after March 13, 2000, and that are held under certain specified legal
authorities by a bank or bank holding company. Silicon Valley Bank does not
currently hold any such equity investments. Under the rules, these equity
investments will be subject to a separate capital charge that will reduce a
bank holding company’s Tier 1 capital and, correspondingly, will remove
these assets from being taken into consideration in establishing a bank holding
company’s required capital ratios discussed above.

The rules provide for the
following incremental Tier 1 capital charges: 8% of the adjusted carrying
value of the portion of such aggregate investments that are up to 15% of
Tier 1 capital; 12% of the adjusted carrying value of the portion of such
aggregate investments that are between 15% and 25% of Tier 1 capital; and
25% of the adjusted carrying value of the portion of such aggregate investments
that exceed 25% of Tier 1 capital. The rules normally do not apply to
unexercised warrants acquired by a bank as additional consideration for making
a loan or to equity securities that are acquired in satisfaction of a debt
previously contracted and that are held and divested in accordance with
applicable law.

The federal banking agencies have
also adopted a joint agency policy statement which provides that the adequacy
and effectiveness of a bank’s interest rate risk management process and the
level of its interest rate exposures are critical factors in the evaluation of
the bank’s capital adequacy. A bank with material weaknesses in its interest
rate risk management process or high levels of interest rate exposure relative
to its capital will be directed by the federal banking agencies to take
corrective actions. Financial institutions that have substantial amounts of
their assets concentrated in high-risk loans or nontraditional banking
activities and who fail to adequately manage these risks may be required to set
aside capital in excess of the regulatory minimums.

The capital ratios of Silicon
Valley Bancshares and Silicon Valley Bank, respectively, exceeded the well-capitalized
requirements, as defined above, at December 31, 2003. See “Item 8.
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 23 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements—Regulatory Matters” for the capital ratios of
Silicon Valley Bancshares and Silicon Valley Bank as of December 31, 2003.

Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank

Silicon Valley Bank is a
California-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. Silicon
Valley Bank is subject to primary supervision, periodic examination and
regulation by the California Department of Financial Institutions and the
Federal Reserve Board. If, as a result of an examination of Silicon Valley
Bank, the Federal Reserve Board should determine that the financial condition,
capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or
other aspects of Silicon Valley Bank’s operations are unsatisfactory or that
Silicon Valley Bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or
regulation, various remedies are available to the Federal Reserve Board. Such
remedies include the power to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require
affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or
practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to
direct an increase in capital, to restrict the growth of Silicon Valley Bank,
to assess civil monetary penalties, to remove officers and directors and
ultimately to terminate Silicon Valley Bank’s deposit insurance, which for a
California-chartered bank would result in a revocation of Silicon Valley Bank’s
charter. The California Department of Financial Institutions has many of the
same remedial powers. Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of
the State of California and the United States affect the operations of Silicon
Valley Bank. State and federal statues and regulations relate to many aspects
of Silicon Valley Bank’s operations, including reserves against deposits,
ownership of deposit accounts, interest rates payable on deposits, loans,
investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends, locations of
branch offices, and capital requirements. Further, Silicon Valley Bank is
required to maintain certain levels of capital. See “Regulatory Capital” above.


The GLB Act changed the powers of
national banks and their subsidiaries, and made similar changes in the powers
of state bank subsidiaries. The GLB Act permits a national bank to underwrite,
deal in and purchase state and local revenue bonds. It also allows a subsidiary
of a national bank to engage in financial activities that the bank cannot,
except for general insurance underwriting and real estate development and
investment. In order for a subsidiary to engage in new financial activities,
the national bank and its depository institution affiliates must be well
capitalized; have at least “satisfactory” general, managerial, and CRA
examination ratings; and meet other qualification requirements relating to
total assets, subordinated debt, capital, risk management, and affiliate
transactions. Subsidiaries of state banks can exercise the same powers as
national bank subsidiaries if they satisfy the same qualifying rules that
apply to national banks. For state banks that are members of the Federal
Reserve System like Silicon Valley Bank, prior approval of the Federal Reserve
Board is required before a bank can create a subsidiary to capitalize on the
additional financial activities empowered by the GLB Act.

Restrictions on Dividends

Bancshares’ ability to pay cash
dividends is limited by generally applicable Delaware corporation law limits.
In addition, Bancshares is a legal entity separate and distinct from Silicon
Valley Bank, and there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the amount
of dividends that may be paid to Bancshares by Silicon Valley Bank. During
2003, 2002, and 2001, Silicon Valley Bank paid dividends of $51.0 million,
$80.0 million, and $140.0 million, respectively, to Bancshares. Consequently,
under these regulatory restrictions, the remaining amount available for payment
of dividends to Bancshares by Silicon Valley Bank totaled $2.8 million at December 31,
2003. The Federal Reserve Board and the California Commissioner of Financial
Institutions (the “Commissioner”) have the authority to prohibit Silicon Valley
Bank from engaging in activities that, in their opinion, constitute unsafe or
unsound practices in conducting its business. Depending upon the financial
condition of Silicon Valley Bank and other factors, the regulators could assert
that the payment of dividends or other payments might, under some
circumstances, be an unsafe or unsound practice. If Silicon Valley Bank fails
to comply with its minimum capital requirements, its regulators could restrict
its ability to pay dividends using prompt corrective action or other
enforcement powers. The Commissioner may impose similar limitations on the
conduct of California-chartered banks. See “Item 8. Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 23 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements—Regulatory Matters” for further discussion on dividend
restrictions.

Transactions with
Affiliates

Transactions between Silicon
Valley Bank and its operating subsidiaries, on the one hand, and their
affiliates, on the other, are subject to restrictions imposed by federal and
state law. These restrictions prevent Bancshares and other affiliates from
borrowing from, or entering into other credit transactions with, Silicon Valley
Bank or its operating subsidiaries unless the loans or other credit transactions
are secured by specified amounts of collateral. All such loans and credit
transactions and other “covered transactions” by Silicon Valley Bank and its
operating subsidiaries with any one affiliate are limited, in the aggregate, to
10% of Silicon Valley Bank’s capital and surplus; and all such loans and credit
transactions and other “covered transactions” by Silicon Valley Bank and its
operating subsidiaries with all affiliates are limited, in the aggregate, to
20% of Silicon Valley Bank’s capital and surplus. For this purpose, “covered
transaction” generally includes, among other things, a loan or extension of
credit to an affiliate, a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an
affiliate, a purchase of assets from an affiliate, the acceptance of a security
issued by an affiliate as collateral for an extension of credit to any
borrower, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on
behalf of an affiliate. A company that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of
Silicon Valley Bank would not be considered to be an “affiliate” of Silicon
Valley Bank or its operating subsidiaries unless it fell into one of certain
categories, such as a “financial subsidiary” authorized under the GLB Act. In
addition, Silicon Valley Bank and its operating subsidiaries generally may not
purchase a low-quality asset from an affiliate, and covered transactions and
other specified transactions by Silicon Valley Bank and its operating
subsidiaries with an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are
consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Also, Silicon Valley Bank and
its operating subsidiaries generally may engage in transactions with affiliates
only on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are
substantially the same, or at least as favorable


to the Bank or
its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions
with nonaffiliated companies.

Prompt Corrective Action
and Other Enforcement Mechanisms

Federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take
corrective and other supervisory action on an insured bank and its holding
company. Federal laws require each federal banking agency to take prompt
corrective action to resolve the problems of insured banks. Each federal
banking agency has issued regulations defining five categories in which an
insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its
capital ratios: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,
significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.

Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is
classified as well capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may
be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the
appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing,
determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound
practice, warrants such treatment. At each successive lower-capital
category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions, including
restrictions on the bank’s activities, operational practices or the ability to
pay dividends. However, the federal banking agencies may not treat an
institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratios actually
warrant such treatment.

In addition to measures taken
under the prompt corrective action provisions, bank holding companies and
insured banks may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal
regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses, or
for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the
agency, or term of a written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may
include the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank; the issuance
of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the termination of
the bank’s deposit insurance; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the
issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal
agreements; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers,
directors, and other institution-affiliated parties; and the enforcement
of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial
determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not
granted.

Safety and Soundness
Guidelines

The federal banking agencies have
adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and
soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines establish
operational and managerial standards relating to: (1) internal controls,
information systems, and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit
underwriting; (4) interest-rate exposure; (5) asset growth and asset
quality; and (6) compensation, fees, and benefits. In addition, the
federal banking agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset
quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are
sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves.

Premiums for Deposit
Insurance

Silicon Valley Bank’s deposit
accounts are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund, as administered by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, up to the maximum permitted by law. The FDIC
assesses an annual premium to maintain a sufficient Fund balance. The amount
charged is based on the capital level of an institution and on a supervisory
assessment based upon the results of examinations findings by the institution’s
primary federal regulator and other information deemed relevant by the FDIC to
the institution’s financial condition and the risk posed to the Bank Insurance
Fund. As of December 31, 2003, the FDIC’s assessment for the insurance of
BIF deposits ranged from 0 to 27 basis points per $100 of insured deposits. The
FDIC may increase or decrease the premium rate on a semi-annual basis. As
of December 31, 2003, Silicon Valley Bank’s assessment rate was the
statutory minimum.

Silicon Valley Bank is also
required to pay an annual assessment of approximately 1.5 basis points per $100
of insured deposits toward the retirement of U.S. government-issued financing
corporation bonds.


Community Reinvestment Act
and Fair Lending

Silicon Valley Bank is subject to
a variety of fair lending laws and reporting obligations, including the CRA.
The CRA generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record
of a bank in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including low-
to moderate-income neighborhoods. In November 2003, the Federal
Reserve Board rated Silicon Valley Bank “satisfactory” in complying with its
CRA obligations. A bank can become subject to substantial penalties and
corrective measures for a violation of certain fair lending laws. When
regulating and supervising other activities or assessing whether to approve
certain applications, the federal banking agencies may consider a bank’s record
of compliance with such laws and CRA obligations.

Privacy

The GLB Act imposed customer
privacy requirements on any company engaged in financial activities. Under
these requirements, a financial company is required to protect the security and
confidentiality of customer nonpublic personal information. Also, for customers
who obtain a financial product such as a loan for personal, family, or
household purposes, a financial company is required to disclose its privacy
policy to the customer at the time the relationship is established and annually
thereafter. The financial company must also disclose its policies concerning
the sharing of the customer’s nonpublic personal information with affiliates
and third parties. If an exemption is not available, a financial company must
provide consumers with a notice of its information-sharing practices that
allows the consumer to reject the disclosure of its nonpublic personal
information to third parties. Third parties that receive such information are
subject to the same restrictions as the financial company on the re-use of the
information. Finally, a financial company is prohibited from disclosing an
account number or similar item to a third party for use in telemarketing,
direct mail marketing, or other marketing through electronic mail. Financial
companies were required to be in compliance with these consumer privacy
requirements no later than July 1, 2001.

USA Patriot Act of 2001

As part of the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA Patriot Act”), Congress adopted the
International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act
of 2001 (IMLAFATA). IMLAFATA amended the Bank Secrecy Act and adopted certain
additional measures that established or increased already existing obligations
of financial institutions, including Silicon Valley Bank, to identify their
customers, watch for and report upon suspicious transactions, respond to
requests for information by federal banking regulatory authorities and law
enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial institutions.
The Secretary of the Treasury has adopted several regulations to implement
these provisions. Silicon Valley Bank is also barred from dealing with foreign “shell”
banks. In addition, IMLAFATA expands the circumstances under which funds in a
bank account may be forfeited. IMLAFATA also amended the BHC Act and the Bank
Merger Act to require the federal banking regulatory authorities to consider
the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering
activities when reviewing an application to expand operations. Silicon Valley
Bank has in place a Bank Secrecy Act compliance program.

Regulation of Certain
Subsidiaries

Two of our subsidiaries, Alliant Partners and SVB
Securities, are registered as broker-dealers with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and as such are subject to regulation by the SEC
and by self-regulatory organizations, such as the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. Our investment advisory subsidiaries, Woodside
Asset Management, Inc., and SVB Asset Management, are registered with the
SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and are subject to
that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to Rule 15c3-1
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), which is
designed to measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a
broker-dealer. Under this rule, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are required to
maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet broker-dealers’
continuing commitments to customers and others.


Under certain circumstances, this
rule could limit the ability of Bancshares to withdraw capital from
Alliant Partners and limit the ability of Silicon Valley Bank to withdraw
capital from SVB Securities.

As broker-dealers, Alliant
Partners and SVB Securities are also subject to other regulations covering the
operations of their respective businesses, including sales and trading
practices; use of client funds and securities; and conduct of directors,
officers, and employees. Broker-dealers are also subject to regulation by state
securities administrators in the states where they do business. Violations of
the stringent regulations governing the actions of a broker-dealer can result
in the revocation of broker-dealer licenses; the imposition of censures or fines;
the issuance of cease and desist orders; and the suspension or expulsion from
the securities business of a firm, its officers, or its employees. The SEC and
the national securities exchanges, in particular, emphasize the need for
supervision and control by broker-dealers of their employees.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters are located at 3003 Tasman
Drive, Santa Clara, California in three buildings, approximating 215,000 square
feet in total. The leases related to our corporate headquarter facilities in
Santa Clara expire in May 2005.

In 2002, we exited leased premises, located in Santa
Clara, California, approximating 18,000 square feet. The lease on the building
will expire in August 2005. Our management determined that the premises
would have no future economic value to our operations, except for any potential
future sub-lease arrangement. Therefore, during 2002, we incurred charge-offs
of approximately $2.5 million related to the exit of these premises.

We currently operate 26 regional
offices. We operate throughout the Silicon Valley with offices in Fremont,
Santa Clara, Palo Alto, and on Sand Hill Road, which is the center of the
venture capital community in California. Other regional offices in California
include: Irvine, Los Angeles, Napa Valley, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa
Barbara, and Sonoma. Office locations outside of California include: Phoenix,
Arizona; Boulder, Colorado; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Boston,
Massachusetts; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York, New York; Durham, North
Carolina; Portland, Oregon; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Austin, Texas; Dallas,
Texas; Northern Virginia; and Seattle, Washington. All of our properties are
occupied under leases, which expire at various dates through 2011, and in
most instances include options to renew or extend at market rates and terms. We
also own leasehold improvements, equipment, furniture, and fixtures at our
offices, all of which are used in our business activities.

ITEM 3. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

There were no legal proceedings
requiring disclosure pursuant to this item pending at December 31, 2003,
or at the date of this report.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION
OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote by the
stockholders of Silicon Valley Bancshares’ common stock during the fourth quarter

PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND
RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Market Information

Our common stock is traded over the counter on the
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (Nasdaq)
national market under the symbol “SIVB.”

The following
table shows the high and low sales prices for our common stock for each
quarterly period during the last two years, based on the daily closing price as
reported by the Nasdaq national market.

Stockholders

There were 705 registered holders
of our stock as of December 31, 2003. Additionally, we believe there were
approximately 8,194 beneficial holders of common stock whose shares are held in
the name of brokerage firms or other financial institutions. We are not
provided with the number or identities of all of these stockholders, but we
have estimated the number of such stockholders from the number of stockholder
documents requested by these brokerage firms for distribution to their
customers.

Dividends

We have not paid cash dividends on our common stock
since 1992. Currently, we have no plan to pay cash dividends on our common
stock. Periodically, we evaluate the decision of paying cash dividends in the
context of our performance, general economic performance, and relevant tax and
financial parameters. Our ability to pay cash dividends is limited by generally
applicable corporate and banking laws and regulations. See “Item 1.
Business—Supervision and Regulation—Restrictions on Dividends,” and “Item 8.
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 23 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements—Regulatory Matters” for additional discussion
on restrictions and limitations on the payment of dividends imposed on us by
government regulations.

The information required by this Item regarding equity
compensation plans is incorporated by reference to the information set forth in
Item 12 of this report.


ITEM 6. SELECTED
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA

The following
selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in Item 8
of this report. Certain reclassifications have been made to our prior years’
results to conform to 2003 presentations. Such reclassifications had no effect
on the results of operations or stockholders’ equity. In addition, the common
stock summary information has been restated to reflect a two-for-one
stock split on May 15, 2000.

Adoption
of FIN No. 46 and SFAS No. 150 in the latter half of 2003 resulted in
a change of classification of trust preferred securities distribution expense
from noninterest expense to interest expense on a prospective basis.
Additionally, the adoption of FIN No. 46 and SFAS No. 150 resulted in
a change of classification of Trust Preferred Securities from noninterest
bearing funding sources to interest-bearing liabilities on a prospective basis.
Prior to adoption of FIN No. 46 and SFAS No. 150, in accordance with
accounting rules in effect at that time, the company recorded trust
preferred securities distribution expense as noninterest expense. On October
30, 2003, $50.0 million in cumulative 7.0% Trust Preferred Securities were
issued through a newly formed special purpose trust, SVB Capital II. The
Company received $51.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of 7.0% Junior
Subordinated Debentures to SVB Capital II. A portion of the net proceeds were
used to redeem the existing $40.0 million of 8.25% Trust Preferred Securities.
Approximately $1.3 million of deferred issuance costs related to redemption of
the $40.0 million 8.25% Trust Preferred Securities were included in interest
expense in the fourth quarter of 2003.


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Management’s discussion and analysis contains
statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current
expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in “Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Factors That May Affect
Future Results.”

The following discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data
as presented in Item 8 of this report. Certain reclassifications have been made
to our prior years’ results to conform to 2003 presentations. Such
reclassifications had no effect on our results of operations or stockholders’
equity.

Overview of Company
Operations

For over 20 years, we have been dedicated to helping
entrepreneurs succeed, specifically focusing on industries where we have deep
knowledge and relationships. Our focus remains on the technology, life science,
private equity, and premium wine niches. In 2003, we continued to diversify our
services to support our clients throughout their life cycles, regardless of
their age or size. We offer a range of financial services that generate three
distinct sources of income.

In part, our income is generated from interest rate
differentials. The difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing
liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates
received on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to clients
and securities held in our investment portfolio, accounts for the major portion
of our earnings. Our deposits are largely obtained from clients within our
technology, life science, and premium winery industry sectors, and, to a lesser
extent, from individuals served by our private banking division. We do not
obtain deposits from conventional retail sources and have no brokered deposits.
As part of negotiated credit facilities, we frequently obtain rights to acquire
stock in the form of warrants in certain client companies.

Fee-based services also generate income for the
company. We market our full range of financial services to clients and private
equity firms including venture capitalists. In addition to our commercial and
personal banking services, we offer fee-based merger and acquisition
services, private placements, and investment and advisory services. Our ability
to integrate and cross-sell our diverse financial services to our clients
is a strength of our business model.

In addition, we seek to obtain
equity returns through investments in direct private equity and venture capital
fund investments. We also manage two limited partnerships: a venture capital
fund and a fund that invests in venture capital funds.

Critical Accounting
Policies

The accompanying management’s discussion and analysis
of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). The
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Management evaluates estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to
the marketable and non-marketable equity securities, allowance for loan losses,
and goodwill. Management bases its estimates on historical experiences and
various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the accounting policies discussed below are
the most critical to our financial statements because their application places
the most significant demands on management’s judgments. Each estimate is
discussed below. The financial impact of each estimate, to the extent
significant to financial results, is discussed in the applicable sections of
the management’s discussion and analysis.


Executive management discussed
the development, selection, and disclosure of these critical accounting
policies with our audit committee on January 28, 2004.

Marketable Equity
Securities

Our investments in
marketable equity securities include:

·

Unexercised
warrants for shares of publicly-traded companies.

·

Investments
in shares of publicly-traded companies. Equity securities in our warrant,
direct equity, and venture capital fund portfolios generally become marketable
when a portfolio company completes an initial public offering on a
publicly-reported market, or is acquired by a publicly-traded company.

·

Marketable
equity securities related to Taurus Growth Partners, L.P. and Libra Partners,
L.P. For information on these entities, see “Item 1. Business—Business
Combinations.”

Unrealized gains or losses
on warrant and equity investment securities are recorded upon the establishment
of a readily determinable fair value of the underlying security, as defined by
SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Instruments.”

·

Unrealized
gains or losses after applicable taxes, on available-for-sale marketable equity
securities that result from initial public offerings are excluded from earnings
and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. We are often contractually restricted from
selling equity securities, for a certain period of time, subsequent to the
portfolio company’s initial public offering. Gains or losses on these
marketable equity instruments are recorded in our consolidated statements of
income in the period the underlying securities are sold to a third party.

·

Gains
or losses on marketable warrant and equity investment securities that result
from a portfolio company being acquired by a publicly-traded company are marked
to market when the acquisition occurs. The resulting gains or losses are
recognized into income on that date, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force, Issue No. 91-5, “Nonmonetary Exchange of Cost-Method Investments.”  Further fluctuations in the market value of
these marketable equity instruments, prior to eventual sale, are excluded from
earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a
separate component of stockholders’ equity. Upon the sale of these equity
securities to a third party, gains and losses, which are measured from the
acquisition price, are recognized in our consolidated statements of income.

·

If
we possess a warrant that can be settled with a net cash payment to us, the
warrant meets the definition of a derivative instrument. Changes in fair value
of such derivative instruments are recognized as securities gains or losses in
our consolidated statements of income.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decline in the fair
value of any of these securities that is considered other than temporary is
recorded in our consolidated statements of income in the period the impairment
occurs. The cost basis of the underlying security is written down to fair value
as a new cost basis.

We consider our marketable equity
securities accounting policies to be critical, as the timing and amount of
income, if any, from these instruments typically depend upon factors beyond our
control. These factors include the general condition of the public equity
markets, levels of mergers and acquisitions activity, fluctuations in the
market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies, and legal and
contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities.

Non-Marketable Equity
Securities

We invest in
non-marketable equity securities in several ways:

·

By
direct purchases of preferred or common stock in privately-held companies

·

By
capital contributions to venture capital funds, which in turn, make investments
in preferred or common stock of privately held companies


·

Through
our venture capital fund, Silicon Valley BancVentures, L.P., which makes
investments in preferred or common stock of privately held companies

·

Through
our fund of funds, SVB Strategic Investors Fund, L.P., which makes investments
in venture capital funds, which in turn, invest in privately held companies

Unexercised warrant securities in private companies
are initially recorded at a nominal value on our consolidated balance sheets. They
are carried at this value until they become marketable or expire.

A summary of
our accounting policies for other non-marketable equity securities is presented
in the following table. A complete description of the accounting policies
follows the table.

Private Equity and Venture Capital Fund
  Investments

Wholly-Owned by Bancshares

Cost basis less identified impairment, if any

Owned by Silicon Valley BancVentures, L.P. and SVB
  Strategic Investors Fund, L.P.

Investment company accounting,
  adjusted to fair value on a quarterly basis through the statement of income

Bancshares’ wholly-owned non-marketable venture
capital fund investments and other direct equity investments are recorded on a
cost basis as our interests are considered minor because we own less than 5% of
the company and have no influence over the company’s operating and financial
policies. Our cost basis in each investment is reduced by returns until the
cost basis of the individual investment is fully recovered. Returns in excess
of the cost basis are recorded as investment gains in noninterest income.

The values of the investments are reviewed at least
quarterly, giving consideration to the facts and circumstances of each
individual investment. Management’s review of private equity investments
typically includes the relevant market conditions, offering prices, operating
results, financial conditions, and exit strategies. A decline in the fair value
that is considered other than temporary is recorded in our consolidated
statements of income in the period the impairment occurs. Any estimated loss is
recorded in noninterest income as investment losses.

Investments held by Silicon Valley BancVentures, L.P.
are recorded at fair value using investment company accounting rules. The
investments consist principally of stock in private companies that are not
traded on a public market and are subject to restrictions on resale. These
investments are carried at estimated fair value as determined by the general
partner. The valuation generally remains at cost until such time that there is
significant evidence of a change in values based upon consideration of the
relevant market conditions, offering prices, operating results, financial
conditions, exit strategies, and other pertinent information. The general
partner, Silicon Valley BancVentures, Inc. is owned and controlled by
Bancshares and has an ownership interest of 10.7% in Silicon Valley
BancVentures, L.P. Therefore, Silicon Valley BancVentures, L.P. is fully
consolidated and any gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated
fair value of the investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in our
consolidated statements of income. The portion of any gains or losses belonging
to the limited partners is reflected in minority interest in net losses of
consolidated affiliates and adjusts Bancshares’ income to its percentage
ownership.

The SVB Strategic Investors Fund, L.P. portfolio
consists primarily of investments in venture capital funds, which are recorded
at fair value using investment company accounting rules. The carrying value of
the investments is determined by the general partner based on the percentage of
SVB Strategic Investors Fund, L.P.’s interest in the total fair market value as
provided by each venture capital fund investment. SVB Strategic Investors, LLC
generally utilizes the fair values assigned to the underlying portfolio
investments by the management of the venture capital funds. The estimated fair
value of the investments is determined after giving consideration to the
relevant market conditions, offering prices, operating results, financial
conditions, exit strategy, and other pertinent information. The general
partner, SVB Strategic Investors, LLC, is owned and controlled by Bancshares
and has an ownership interest of 11.1% in SVB Strategic Investors Fund, L.P. Therefore,
SVB Strategic Investors Fund, L.P. is fully consolidated and any gains or
losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the venture
capital fund investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in our
consolidated statements of income. The


limited partner’s share of any
gains or losses is reflected in minority interest in net losses of consolidated
affiliates and adjusts Bancshares’ income to its percentage ownership.

We consider our non-marketable
equity securities accounting policies to be critical, as the timing and amount
of gain or losses, if any, from these instruments depend upon factors beyond
our control. These factors include the general condition of the public equity
markets, levels of mergers and acquisitions activity, and legal and contractual
restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities. Therefore, we
cannot predict future gains or losses with any degree of accuracy and any gains
or losses are likely to vary materially from period to period. In addition, the
valuation of non-marketable equity securities included in our financial
statements represents our best interpretation of the underlying equity
securities performance at this time. Because of the inherent uncertainty of
valuations, the estimated values of these securities may differ significantly
from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities
existed, and the differences could be material. Future adverse changes in
market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could
result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the
investments that may not be reflected in an investment’s carrying value,
thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.

Allowance for Loan Losses

We consider our accounting policy relating to the
estimation of the allowance for loan losses to be critical as estimation of the
allowance involves material estimates by our management and is particularly
susceptible to significant changes in the near term.

We define credit risk as the probability of sustaining
a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in
accordance with the terms of the contract. Through the administration of loan
policies and monitoring of the loan portfolio, our management seeks to reduce
such credit risks. While we follow underwriting and credit monitoring procedures,
which we believe are appropriate in growing and managing the loan portfolio, in
the event of nonperformance by these other parties, our potential exposure to
credit losses could significantly affect our consolidated financial position
and earnings.

The allowance for loan losses is established through a
provision for loan losses charged to expense to provide for credit risk. Our
allowance for loan losses is established for loan losses that are probable but
not yet realized. The process of anticipating loan losses is imprecise. Our
management applies the following evaluation process to our loan portfolio to
estimate the required allowance for loan losses:

We maintain a systematic process for the evaluation of
individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses. On a
quarterly basis, each loan in our portfolio is assigned a credit risk-rating. Credit
risk-ratings are assigned on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing loans with
a low risk of nonpayment, 9 representing loans with the highest risk of
nonpayment, and 10 representing loans, which have been charged-off. This credit
risk-rating evaluation process includes, but is not limited to, consideration
of such factors as payment status, the financial condition of the borrower,
borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral values,
potential loan concentrations, and general economic conditions. Our policies
require a committee of senior management to review credit relationships that
exceed specific dollar values, at least quarterly. Our review process evaluates
the appropriateness of the credit risk rating and allocation of allowance for
loan losses, as well as other account management functions. In addition, our
management receives and approves an analysis for all impaired loans, as defined
by the SFAS No. 114 “Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.”
The allowance for loan losses is allocated based on a formula allocation for
similarly risk-rated loans, or for specific risk issues, which suggest a
probable loss factor exceeding the formula allocation for a specific loan, or
for individual impaired loans as determined by SFAS No. 114.

Our evaluation process was
designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. We assess
the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio by utilizing modeling
techniques. For this purpose, we have developed a statistical model based on
historical loan loss migration to estimate an appropriate allowance for
outstanding loan balances. In addition, we apply macro and contingent
allocations to the results of the aforementioned model to ascertain the total
allowance for loan losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and
other objective information, the classification of loans


and the
establishment of the allowance for loan losses, relies, to a great extent, on
the judgment and experience of our management.

Historical Loan Loss
Migration Model

We use the historical loan loss migration model as a
basis for determining expected loan loss factors by credit risk-rating category.
The effectiveness of the historical loan loss migration model is predicated on
the theory that historical trends are predictive of future experience. Specifically,
the model calculates the likelihood and rate of a loan in one risk-rating
category moving one category lower using loan data from our portfolio.

We analyze the historical loan loss migration trend by
compiling gross loan loss data and by credit risk-rating for the rolling
twelve-month periods as of the end of each quarter. Each of the loans
charged-off over the twelve-month period is assigned a credit risk rating at
the period end of each of the preceding four quarters. On an annual basis, the
model calculates charged-off loans as a percentage of current period end loans
by credit risk-rating category. The percentages are averaged and are aggregated
to estimate our loan loss factors. The annual periods reviewed and averaged to
form the loan loss factors will be limited to twelve quarters beginning March 31,
2004 when our ten grade risk rating system will have twelve quarters of
history. The current period end client loan balances are aggregated by
risk-rating category. Loan loss factors for each risk-rating category are
ultimately applied to the respective period end client loan balances for each
corresponding risk-rating category, to provide an estimation of the allowance
for loan losses.

Contingent and Macro
Allocations

Additionally, we apply a contingent allocation to the
results of this model. Our contingent allocation acknowledges that unfunded
credit obligations can result in future losses. Unfunded credit obligations at
each quarter end are allocated to credit risk-rating categories in accordance
with the client’s credit risk-rating. We provide for the risk of loss on
unfunded credit obligations by allocating fixed credit risk-rating factors to
our unfunded credit obligations.

A macro allocation is
calculated each quarter based upon an assessment of the risks that may lead to
a loan loss experience different from our historical results. These risks are
aggregated to become our macro allocation. Based on management’s prediction or
estimates of changing risks in the lending environment, the macro allocation
may vary significantly from period to period and includes but is not limited to
consideration of the following factors:

·

Changes
in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and
collections, charge-off and recovery practices

·

Changes
and development in national and local economic business conditions, including the
market and economic condition of our clients’ industry sectors

·

Changes
in the nature of our loan portfolio

·

Changes
in experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff

·

Changes
in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans

·

Changes
in the trend of the volume of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings
and other loan modifications

Finally, we compute several modified versions of the
model, which provide additional assurance that the statistical results of the
historical loan loss migration model are reasonable. Our Chief Credit Officer
and Chief Financial Officer evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan
losses based on the results of our analysis.

Goodwill

Goodwill, which arises from the purchase price
exceeding the assigned value of the net assets of an acquired business,
represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being
acquired. The majority of our goodwill resulted from the acquisition of Alliant
Partners, a mergers and acquisitions


firm. The value of this goodwill
is supported ultimately by revenue from the acquired businesses. A decline in
earnings as a result of a decline in mergers and acquisitions transaction
volume or a decline in the valuations of mergers and acquisitions clients could
lead to impairment, which would be recorded as a write-down in our consolidated
statements of income.

On an annual basis or as circumstances dictate,
management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may
indicate impairment in the carrying amount. The evaluation methodology for
potential impairments is inherently complex, and involves significant
management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions. We evaluate
impairment using a two-step process. First, we compare the aggregate fair value
of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair
value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount
of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare the “implied”
fair value, defined below, of the reporting unit’s goodwill with its carrying
amount. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value,
then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing goodwill down to the implied
fair value.

We primarily use a discounted future cash flows
approach to value the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment.
These estimates involve many assumptions, including expected results of
operations, assumed discounts rates, and assumed growth rates for the reporting
units. The discount rate used is based on standard industry practice, taking
into account the expected equity risk premium, the size of the business, and
the probability of the reporting unit achieving its financial forecasts. The
implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting
unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the unit had been
acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the
purchase price.

Events that may indicate goodwill impairment include
significant or adverse changes in results of operations of the business,
economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
unanticipated competition; and a more likely-than-not expectation that a
reporting unit will be sold or disposed of. More information about goodwill is
included in  “Item 8. Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 9 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements—Goodwill” and

Results of Operations

Earnings Summary

We reported net income in 2003 of $12.0 million,
as compared to net income of $53.4 million in 2002 and $88.2 million
in 2001. Diluted earnings per common share totaled $0.32 in 2003, as compared
to $1.18 in 2002, and $1.79 in 2001. Return on average equity in 2003 was 2.4%,
as compared to 8.5% in 2002, and 13.5% in 2001. Return on average assets was
0.3% in 2003, as compared to 1.4% in 2002, and 2.0% in 2001.

The decrease in net income between 2002 and 2003,
primarily resulted from an increase of $76.3 million in noninterest expense.
The increase in noninterest expense was principally due to the following
factors: (1) impairment of goodwill charges aggregating $63.0 million
related to Alliant Partners, and (2) an increase in expense associated
with our incentive compensation program, which we believe was necessary to
retain our professional talent in an improving economic environment.
Additionally, due to a decrease in the weighted-average prime rate from 4.7% in
2002 to 4.1% in 2003, we earned lower interest income from our investment
securities and loan portfolios, which resulted in a decline in net interest
income. However, our provision for loan and lease loss expense decreased by
$10.1 million between 2002 and 2003, largely due to a significant loan loss
recovery in the third quarter of 2003 and our improved credit quality.

The decrease
in net income for 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily attributable to a
decline in both net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by
decreases in both provision for loan losses and income tax expense. The major
components of net income and changes in these components are summarized in the
following table for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, and
are discussed in more detail on the following pages.

Net Interest Income and
Margin

Net interest income is defined as the difference
between interest earned (primarily on loans, investment securities, federal
funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell) and interest
paid on funding sources (such as deposits and borrowings). Net interest income
is our principal source of revenue. Net interest margin is defined as the
amount of net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis,
expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The average
yield earned on interest-earning assets is the amount of taxable-equivalent
interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning
assets. The average rate paid on funding sources is defined as interest expense
as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.


The following
table sets forth average assets, liabilities, minority interest and
stockholders’ equity, interest income and interest expense, average yields and
rates, and the composition of our net interest margin for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002, and 2001.

(1)

Includes average interest-bearing
deposits in other financial institutions of $783, $609, and $568 in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively.

(2)

Interest income on nontaxable investments is presented
on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate
of 35% for all years presented. These adjustments were $3,365, $3,712, and
$5,815 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively.

(3)

Average loans include average nonaccrual loans of
$16,089, $19,602, and $21,565 in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

(4)

Average loans are net of average unearned income of
$12,573, $11,651, and $7,669 in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

(5)

Loan interest income includes loan fees of $36,348,
$36,701, and $37,407 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(6)

Adoption of

FIN No. 46 and SFAS No. 150 in the latter
half of 2003 resulted in a change of classification of trust preferred
securities distribution expense from noninterest expense to interest expense on
a prospective basis. Additionally, the adoption of FIN No. 46 and SFAS No. 150
resulted in a change of classification of Trust Preferred Securities from
noninterest bearing funding sources to interest-bearing liabilities on a
prospective basis. Prior to adoption of FIN No. 46 and SFAS No. 150,
in accordance with accounting rules in effect at that time, the company
recorded trust preferred securities distribution expense as noninterest
expense. On October 30, 2003, $50.0 million in cumulative 7.0% Trust
Preferred Securities were issued through a newly formed special purpose trust,
SVB Capital II. We received $51.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of 7.0%
Junior Subordinated Debentures to SVB Capital II. A portion of the net proceeds
were used to redeem the existing $40.0 million of 8.25% Trust Preferred
Securities. Approximately $1.3 million of deferred issuance costs related to
redemption of the $40.0 million 8.25% Trust Preferred Securities were included
in interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2003.


Net interest
income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “volume change.”
Net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning
assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “rate
change.” The following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest
expense for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities. The table also reflects the amount of simultaneous changes
attributable to both volume and rate for the years indicated. For this table,
changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated in
proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and average rate.
Changes relating to investments in non-taxable municipal securities are
presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using the federal statutory
tax rate of 35% for all years presented.

2003 Compared to 2002

Net Interest Income

Net interest income on a fully
taxable-equivalent basis totaled $192.2 million in 2003, a decrease of
$6.2 million, or 3.1%, from $198.4 million in 2002. The decrease in net
interest income was due to a $10.6 million, or 4.9%, decline in interest
income, offset by a $4.4 million, or 24.7%, decrease in interest expense over
the comparable prior-year period. Interest expense in 2003 included $3.0
million relating to the SFAS No. 150 and Fin No. 46-mandated
classification of trust preferred securities distribution expense as interest
expense, for the latter half of 2003. For periods prior to June 30, 2003,
trust preferred securities distribution expense was classified as noninterest
expense, and therefore did not impact the net interest margin.

Impact of Declining Market
Interest Rates on Interest-Earning Assets

Throughout the current decreasing market interest rate
environment, we implemented numerous measures to minimize the impact to our net
interest margin. These measures included diversifying the product mix in the
investment portfolio to higher-yielding, high-quality assets and
reducing rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. Additionally, we have
increased the duration of our investment securities portfolio by replacing
certain short-term, lower yielding securities with longer-term, higher-yielding
securities such as collateralized mortgage obligations, thereby taking
advantage of a steeper interest rate curve. Overall, the duration of our
investment securities portfolio increased to approximately 1.7 years in 2003,
from approximately 1.5 years in 2002.


The $10.6 million decrease in
interest income for 2003, as compared to 2002, was the result of a $12.4
million unfavorable rate variance associated with each component of
interest-earning assets, partially offset by a $1.8 million favorable volume
variance. Market interest rates decreased slightly during 2003, which caused
the weighted average prime rate to decline by 55 basis points from 4.7% in 2002.
Consequently, the yield on loans decreased by 60 basis points in 2003 to 8.3%
from 8.9% in 2002. In 2003, we incurred a $10.9 million unfavorable rate
variance associated with our loan portfolio. Floating rate loans, which
represent approximately 81.2% of our total loan portfolio, produced lower
interest income due to a lower average prime rate in 2003 compared to 2002. The
average yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to
resell also decreased due to the decline in market interest rates, from 1.9% in
2002 to 1.2% in 2003, which caused a $1.4 million unfavorable rate variance.

Net Increase in
Interest-Earning Assets

Total average interest-earning assets in 2003
increased $156.2 million, or 4.5% as compared to the prior year. The increase
in total average interest-earning assets was principally funded by an increase
in average noninterest-bearing deposits of $246.0 million, or 16.2%, and an
increase in average long-term debt of $81.7 million, or 343.8%, offset by a
decrease in average stockholders’ equity of $136.0 million, or 21.6%. The
increase in average long-term debt was principally due to the issuance of
$150.0 million of zero coupon convertible debt in May 2003. The net
proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debt were largely used to
repurchase our common stock, which resulted in the aforementioned decrease in
average stockholders’ equity.

Average loans increased $37.7 million, or 2.1%, in
2003, as compared to 2002, resulting in a $3.4 million favorable volume
variance. In 2003, we grew our average loan portfolio to a record level by
continuing to focus on attracting middle-market and mature corporate
technology and life sciences clients, which we believe are under-served
by our competitors. We experienced loan growth across most of the industry
sectors we serve. Additionally, our new loans continue to be subject to our
existing underwriting practices. We expect further growth in our loan balances
to bolster our net interest margin since it will shift liquid interest-earning
assets from our investment portfolio, which currently yields 3.6%, to loans
with yields ranging from approximately 4.3% to 8.9%. We expect modest loan
growth to continue throughout 2004.

Average investment securities for 2003 decreased
$113.5 million, or 7.3%, as compared to 2002, resulting in a $4.7 million
unfavorable volume variance. The decrease in average investment securities was
primarily concentrated in short-term investments, partially offset by an
increase in longer-term collateralized mortgage obligations.

Average federal funds sold and securities purchased
under agreement to resell increased $232.0 million, or 151.4% in 2003, as
compared to the prior year, resulting in a $3.1 million favorable volume
variance. This increase was primarily due to a change in the investment
portfolio mix. We expect to continue the trend of managing federal funds sold
and overnight repurchase agreements at appropriate levels.

The yield on average interest-earning
assets decreased 60 basis points in 2003 from the prior year. This decrease
primarily resulted from a decline in short-term market interest rates;
thus, we earned lower yields on each component of our interest-earning
assets.

Decrease in Interest
Expense

Total interest expense in 2003 decreased $4.4 million
from 2002. This decrease was due to a favorable rate variance of $7.4 million,
partially offset by an unfavorable volume variance of $3.0 million. The
favorable rate variance between 2002 and 2003 primarily resulted from a
reduction in the average rates paid on all of our interest-bearing deposits,
particularly those rates paid on our time deposit and bonus money market
deposit products.

The unfavorable volume variance was due in large part
to the SFAS No. 150-mandated classification of trust preferred securities
distribution expense of $3.0 million as interest expense, for the latter half
of 2003. Trust preferred securities distribution expense was previously
classified as noninterest expense. Of the $3.0 million in trust preferred
securities distribution expense, approximately $1.3 million related to the


recognition of deferred issuance
costs in the fourth quarter of 2003, due to the redemption of our 8.25% Trust
Preferred Securities. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we entered into an
interest rate swap agreement to swap our 7.0% fixed payment on Junior
Subordinated Debentures for a variable rate based on the London Inter-Bank
Offer rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. We expect this swap to have a positive impact
on our cost of funds in 2004.

Additionally, we experienced an unfavorable volume
variance related to long-term debt of $1.0 million. In the second quarter of
2003, we issued $150.0 million of zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes,
with a maturity of June 15, 2008. Although no interest is paid on the
notes, we experienced an increase in interest expense due to amortization of
the convertible debt issuance costs. The overall unfavorable volume variance
caused primarily by long-term debt and Trust Preferred Securities was partially
offset by average time deposits, which decreased from $611.0 million in 2002 to
$485.1 million in 2003, causing a $1.3 million favorable volume variance.

The average cost of funds paid on
average interest-bearing liabilities in 2003 was 0.8% down from 1.1% in
2002. This decrease in the average cost of funds was largely due to a decrease
of 50 basis points on the average rates paid on both our money market deposit
and time deposit products.

2002 Compared to 2001

Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent
basis totaled $198.4 million in 2002, a decrease of $70.4 million, or 26.2%,
from $268.8 million in 2001. The decrease in net interest income was due to an
$89.8 million, or 29.3%, decline in interest income, offset by a $19.5 million,
or 52.1%, decrease in interest expense over the comparable prior-year
period.

In 2002, we implemented numerous
measures to minimize the impact of the decline in market interest rates. These
measures included diversifying the product mix in the investment portfolio to
higher-yielding, high-quality assets, reducing rates paid on
interest-bearing deposits, and embedding minimum interest rate “floors”
into client loan agreements. We also increased the average expected life of
investments in our portfolio by replacing some assets from lower-yielding
short-term securities to higher-yielding longer-term
securities, thereby taking advantage of the steeper interest rate curve.
Overall, the expected average life of portfolio investments increased to
approximately 1.5 years, as compared to less than 1 year in 2001.

Interest Income

The $89.8 million decrease in interest income for
2002, as compared to 2001, was the result of a $14.6 million unfavorable volume
variance, combined with a $75.2 million unfavorable rate variance. The $14.6
million unfavorable volume variance resulted from a $514.8 million, or 12.9%,
decrease in average interest-earning assets over the comparable prior-year
period. The decrease in average interest-earning assets was primarily
concentrated in highly-liquid federal funds sold, and securities
purchased under agreement to resell, which decreased $356.8 million, and
investment securities, which decreased $263.3 million. These decreases were
partially offset by $105.3 million increase in loans.

Average loans increased $105.3 million, or 6.4%, in
2002, as compared to 2001, resulting in an $11.4 million favorable volume
variance. At December 31, 2002, we grew our loan portfolio to a record
level by refocusing on attracting middle-market and mature corporate
technology and life sciences clients, which we believe are under-served
by our competitors. In 2002, we experienced loan growth across most of the
industry sectors we serve.

Average investment securities for 2002 decreased
$263.3 million, or 14.5%, as compared to 2001, resulting in a $14.1 million
unfavorable volume variance. The decrease in average investment securities was
primarily centered in U.S. agency securities, which decreased $291.0 million.
This decrease resulted from declines in our average deposit balances and our
common stock repurchase programs. Deposit balances declined in 2001 as our clients
continued to experience reduced liquidity due to the slowdown in the capital
markets and lower levels of venture capital fund investment. However, quarterly
average deposit balances stabilized during 2002.


Average federal funds sold and securities purchased
under agreement to resell in 2002 decreased $356.8 million, or 70.0%, as
compared to the prior year, resulting in an $11.9 million unfavorable volume
variance. This decline was primarily due to a change in the investment
portfolio mix, as funds were invested in longer-term, high quality
securities while still maintaining high levels of liquidity.

Unfavorable rate variances associated with each
component of interest-earning assets caused a $75.2 million decline in
our interest income for 2002 as compared to 2001. Short-term market
interest rates decreased rapidly throughout 2001, and we experienced
additional, although less severe, market interest rate decreases in 2002. Thus,
we earned lower yields in 2002 on federal funds sold and securities purchased
under agreements to resell, as well as our investment securities, a significant
portion of which were short-term in nature. The decrease in short-term
market interest rates resulted in a combined $35.2 million unfavorable rate
variance in 2002, as compared to 2001. In 2002, we incurred a $40.0 million
unfavorable rate variance associated with our loan portfolio. The average yield
on loans in 2002 decreased 230 basis points to 8.9% from 11.2% in the prior
year. This was due to two factors. First, the lower average prime rate reduced
yields on floating rate loans, which represent approximately 79.0% of our total
loan portfolio. The weighted-average prime rate declined 224 basis points
from 6.9% in 2001 to 4.7% in 2002. Second, our fixed-rate loans are
priced by reference to U.S. Treasury securities. During 2002, the treasury
yield curve moved lower and flattened. Thus, we earned lower yields on new,
renewed, and refinanced fixed-rate loans.

The yield on average interest-earning
assets decreased 150 basis points in 2002 from the prior year. This decrease
primarily resulted from a decline in short-term market interest rates;
thus, we earned lower yields on each component of our interest-earning
assets.

Interest Expense

Total interest expense in 2002 decreased $19.5 million
from 2001. This decrease was due to a favorable rate variance of $14.7 million,
combined with a favorable volume variance of $4.7 million. The favorable rate
variance largely resulted from a reduction between 2001 and 2002 in the average
rate paid on our time-deposit product from 3.1% to 1.2%.

The average cost of funds paid on
average interest-bearing liabilities in 2002 was 1.1% down from 2.0% in
2001. This decrease in the average cost of funds was largely due to a decrease
of 190 basis points in the average rate paid on our time-deposit product.

Provision for Loan Losses

The provision for loan losses is based on our
evaluation of the adequacy of the existing allowance for loan losses in
relation to total loans and on our periodic assessment of the inherent and
identified risk dynamics of the loan portfolio resulting from reviews of
selected individual loans and loan commitments. For a more detailed discussion
of credit quality and the allowance for loan losses, see “Item 7. Critical
Accounting Policies” and “Item 7. Financial Condition—Credit Quality and the
Allowance for Loan Losses.”

Our provision for loan losses
totaled $(6.2) million in 2003, as compared to $3.9 million in 2002, and $16.7
million in 2001. We obtained net recoveries of $0.2 million in 2003, as
compared to net charge-offs of $5.8 million in 2002, and $18.1 million in
2001. The decrease in provision for loan losses for 2003, as compared to 2002,
primarily resulted from $20.4 million in recoveries in 2003 and improved credit
quality. A large portion of the loan loss recoveries in 2003 related to the
settlement of remaining film loan litigation. We expect lower gross loan loss
recoveries in 2004. The decrease in provision for loan losses for 2002, as
compared to 2001, resulted from $22.2 million in recoveries in 2002, relating
in large part to loan loss recoveries from film loan litigation settlements.


Noninterest Income

The following
table summarizes the components of noninterest income and the percent change
from year to year:

Client investment fees decreased in 2003 from 2002 and
2001. We offer private label investment, sweep products, and asset management
services to clients on which we earn fees on clients’ average balances, ranging
from 10 to 100 basis points in 2003, 12.5 to 107 basis points in 2002, and 11
to 107 basis points in 2001. At December 31, 2003, $9.3 billion in client
funds were invested in these products, compared to $8.5 billion in 2002, and
$9.3 billion in 2001. Of these funds, $6.4 billion, $8.5 billion, and $6.4
billion were invested in mutual fund products as of December 31, 2003,
2002, and 2001, respectively. Total invested client funds have increased
between 2002 and 2003, however, the decrease in client investment fees from
year to year was due to a shift in client investment mix. The sustained low
interest rate environment has caused lower priced investment products to become
a more attractive investment strategy for many of our clients.

In the first quarter of 2003, we established a
registered investment advisor (SVB Asset Management) to meet the demand for
active management of client investment portfolios. We expect this action will
allow us to provide a more expansive and competitive array of investment
products and service to our clients. While the fees earned per dollar managed
has been reduced, our strategy is to make up for the lower fees through greater
volume. At December 31, 2003, SVB Asset Management had $591.6 million of
assets under management.

Deposit service charges have increased steadily from
year to year, primarily due to increased client usage of our expanded and
enhanced suite of fee-based cash management services. Additionally, clients
compensate us for depository services, either through earnings credits computed
on their demand deposit balances, or through explicit payments recognized by us
as deposit service charges income. Earnings credits are calculated using client
average daily deposit balances, less a reserve requirement and a discounted
U.S. Treasury bill interest rate. Clients received lower earnings credits in
2003, as compared to the prior years due to lower market interest rates. As
such, our clients had fewer credits to offset deposit service charges. Thus, we
earned higher recognizable deposit service charges year over year.

Corporate finance fees increased slightly in 2003 from
2002. Corporate finance fees totaled $12.1 million in 2002, a substantial
increase from 2001. In 2002, Alliant Partners, our investment-banking
subsidiary, generated the entire balance of $12.1 million. SVB Securities, Inc.,
generated $1.1 million in corporate finance fees in 2001. The increase in
corporate finance fees from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to the acquisition
of Alliant on September 28, 2001, which increased our mergers and
acquisitions advisory activity. See “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data—Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Business
Combinations.” Alliant’s revenues are typically a function of the valuation of
their clients’ mergers and acquisitions transactions. In recent years, economic
events have depressed valuations of high technology and life sciences
corporations. Thus, Alliant has not achieved its merger and acquisition revenue
goals. Consequently, we have incurred aggregate impairment of goodwill charges
of $63.0 million in 2003, see the discussion under the heading “Noninterest
Expense” contained later in this “Management Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section.


Letter of credit fees, foreign exchange fees, and
other trade finance income decreased between 2002 and 2003, as a result of
increased competition and increased availability of these product types from
other financial institutions. The increase in income between 2001 and 2002
reflects an increase in the number of products offered by us and an increase in
the volume of client foreign exchange transactions during 2002 as compared to
2001.

Due to an increase in client initial public offering
and mergers and acquisition activities, the income from client warrants
increased between 2002 and 2003. Conversely, we experienced a decrease in
warrant income between 2001 and 2002, due to a slowdown of those activities in
2002 from 2001. The timing and amount of income from client warrants typically
depends upon factors beyond our control, including the general condition of the
public equity markets as well as the merger and acquisition environment. We
have historically obtained rights to acquire stock, in the form of warrants, in
certain clients, primarily as part of negotiated credit facilities. The receipt
of warrants does not change the loan covenants or other collateral control
techniques we employ to mitigate the risk of a loan becoming nonperforming. The
collateral requirements on loans with warrants are similar to lending arrangements
where warrants are not obtained. Due to the uncertainty of factors beyond our
control, we cannot predict the timing and amount of income from client warrants
with any degree of accuracy, and this income is likely to vary materially from
period to period.

Credit card fees have continued to increase year over
year as a result of our increased efforts to market a full range of fee-based
financial services to our clients. In 2003, client usage of this product has
increased, as well has fees charged for this line of service.

We experienced improvements in investment securities
losses from year to year. The 2003 and 2002 losses primarily related to the
write-down of certain venture capital fund and direct equity investments.
Excluding the impact of minority interest, the net write-downs of our
equity securities totaled approximately $2.8 million in 2003, $4.1 million
in 2002, and $6.6 million in 2001. In 2004, we expect continued volatility in
equity securities losses, with general improvement in a lower range in the near
term.

Other noninterest income largely
consisted of service-based fee income associated with our deposit and
loan services, as well as fund management fees. It totaled $9.3 million in
2003, $8.0 million in 2002, and $10.7 million in 2001. The decrease in
2002, as compared to 2001, was primarily due to the elimination of supply chain
service operations in late 2001.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense in 2003 totaled $262.7 million,
compared to $186.4 million in 2002, and $183.5 million in 2001.

The following
table presents the detail of noninterest expense and the percent change, year
over year:


Compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2003
from 2002, primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense. We
believe this was necessary to retain our professional talent in an improving
economic environment. Average full-time equivalent (FTE) personnel
decreased from 1,000 in 2002 to 994 in 2003, and was 970 in 2001. Compensation
and benefits expenses increased by $16.1 million between 2001 and 2002. We
experienced an increase in compensation and benefits during 2002 for the
following reasons. First, we completed a strategic realignment of some of our
business activities, which resulted in severance expense of $1.1 million in
2002. Second, we incurred $6.1 million in incentive compensation expense
related to our target earnings levels being achieved in 2002, as compared to $0
in 2001. The increase in FTE personnel from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to
conversion of certain consultants to permanent employees status, the
acquisition of Alliant Partners and Woodside Asset Management, Inc., and
our efforts to build an infrastructure sufficient to support our business
activities and regulatory requirements. We are continuing our specific measures
to control the number of FTE personnel during 2004.

We incurred aggregate impairment of goodwill charges
related to the Alliant Partners reporting unit of $63.0 million ($38.7 million
net of tax, or $1.04 per diluted common share in 2003). Alliant Partners was
acquired by us on September 28, 2001. In recent years, economic events
have depressed valuations of technology and life sciences corporations. Thus,
Alliant has not achieved its originally forecasted results of operations.
Consequently, we have incurred these aggregate impairment charges, see “Item 8.
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements—Goodwill” for further information. For a
discussion of our goodwill accounting policies, see “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Critical Accounting Policies—Goodwill.”

Occupancy expense decreased by $2.8 million between
2002 and 2003. In 2002, we exited leased premises in Santa Clara, California,
approximating 18,000 square feet. The lease on the building expires in August 2005.
Our management determined that the premises would have no future economic value
to our operations, except for any potential future sub-lease arrangement.
Therefore, during 2002, we incurred charge-offs of approximately
$2.5 million related to the exit of these premises. We incurred no such
charge-offs in 2003 or 2001.

Professional services expenses, which consist of costs
associated with corporate legal services, litigation settlements, accounting
and auditing services, consulting, and our board of directors, has decreased
year to year. In 2003, we settled the remaining aspects of certain film loan
litigation and were able to recover related legal expenses. Additionally, over
the past few years, we have implemented stringent measures to control the use
of external consulting services. In 2002 as compared to 2001, the decrease in
professional services expenses was primarily related to a reduction in the number
of business initiatives supported by consultants.

Furniture and equipment expenses increased in 2003
compared to 2002, mainly due to an increase in information technology
maintenance costs related to new business initiatives. The decrease in
furniture and equipment expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001, was primarily due
to a $1.2 million charge-off of software related to an abandoned project
in the third quarter of 2001.

Correspondent bank fees increased from year to year.
Many of our correspondent banks provide earnings credits to offset bank fees we
incur when using their services. Earnings credits are generally calculated
using average daily deposit balances, less a reserve requirement and a short-term
market interest rate. We received lower earnings credits in 2003 as compared to
2002 and 2001, due to our maintaining lower average balances with our
correspondent banks and lower market interest rates. As such, we had fewer
earnings credits to offset bank fees charges incurred by us. Thus, we incurred
higher recognizable bank fees in 2003 as compared to 2002 and 2001. Management
made the decision to lower the average balances with correspondent banks
because we were able to earn more on our funds by investing them than we would
have saved by leaving these funds with the correspondent banks.


Beginning July 1, 2003, trust preferred
securities distribution expense was required to be classified as interest
expense on a prospective basis, pursuant to adoption of SFAS No. 150.
Therefore, noninterest expense does not reflect trust preferred securities
distribution expense for the latter half of 2003. The 8.25% Trust Preferred
Securities, originally issued during the second quarter of 1998, paid a fixed-rate
quarterly distribution and had a maximum maturity of 30 years. We redeemed the
$40.0 million of 8.25% Trust Preferred Securities in the fourth quarter of
2003.

On June 3, 2002, we entered into a derivative
agreement with a notional amount of $40.0 million. The agreement hedged against
the risk of changes in fair value associated with our $40.0 million of 8.25%
Trust Preferred Securities. The derivative agreement provided a $1.0 million
and $1.1 million decrease in trust preferred security distribution expense for
2003 and 2002, respectively. This interest rate swap was terminated effective June 23,
2003.

Other noninterest expenses
totaled $8.6 million in 2003, $5.7 million in 2002, and $11.0 million in 2001.
Other noninterest expense is comprised of miscellaneous loan and deposit
related client service expenses, as well as insurance expense and other
assessments.

Minority Interest in Net
Losses of Consolidated Affiliates

The minority interest limited
partner’s share of losses were $7.7 million, $7.8 million, and $7.5 million in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The minority interest limited partner losses
were primarily due to management fees and write-downs of minority
interest-owned investments associated with SVB Strategic Investors Fund,
L.P. and Silicon Valley BancVentures, L.P. of $5.5 million, $5.7 million, and
$5.8 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 21.0% in 2003,
compared to 33.4% in 2002 and 37.5% in 2001. The decrease in our effective tax
rate from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to a higher impact of our
tax-advantaged investments on our lower overall earnings, partially offset by
the exclusion of REIT tax benefits.

In the third quarter of 2002, we implemented a real
estate investment trust (REIT) to serve as a future-funding vehicle. In 2002 we
obtained $0.8 million in tax benefits from the REIT structure. In 2003, we did
not take REIT tax benefits of $1.7 million in response to a California
Franchise Tax Board (FTB) announcement on December 31, 2003, which related
to new tax shelter regulations. We believe we are appropriately reserved for
prior year benefits that were previously recognized. We will not reflect REIT
tax benefits in our future financial statements until this matter has been
resolved with the FTB. Based on information provided by our financial advisors,
we believe that our position with regard to the REIT has merit and we plan to
pursue our tax claims and defend our use of this entity. For further
information on our effective tax rate, see “Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements—Income Taxes.”

The change in our effective
income tax rate from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to an increase in items
giving rise to permanent tax benefits. In particular, on September 11,
2002, California enacted a law requiring large banks (those with average assets
in excess of $500 million) to conform to federal law with respect to accounting
for bad debts. Prior to the law change, all banks, regardless of size, were
eligible to use the reserve method of accounting for bad debts which enabled
them to take deductions for anticipated bad debt losses prior to the losses
being incurred for California tax purposes. With the change, large banks may
now only deduct actual charge-offs net of recoveries in determining their California
taxable income. Banks that are required to conform to the new law must include
in taxable income 50 percent of their existing bad debt reserves as of the end
of the prior tax year. As a concession for requiring large banks to comply with
the new law, recapture of the remaining 50 percent of the reserve is waived
thereby creating a permanent tax benefit. Our one-time tax benefit resulting
from the law change was $0.8 million and was reflected in our income tax
expense for 2002. This change, while reducing income tax expense, also results
in accelerated tax payments.


Operating Segment Results

Commercial banking’s pre-tax income for the year
ending 2003 was $66.4 million compared to $70.8 million for the same period in
2002. This decrease was caused by declines in net interest income and
noninterest income, partially offset by a decline in net charge-offs. The
commercial bank benefited from net recoveries of loan losses in 2003. Our
segment reporting includes net charge-offs in lieu of provision expense to determine
segment financial performance.

For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
merchant banking’s pre-tax income was $6.1 million and $1.6 million,
respectively. In 2003, noninterest income increased by $7.0 million, primarily
related to warrant income of $7.5 million compared to $1.7 million for the same
period in 2002.

Investment banking’s pre-tax (loss) income for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, was $(62.6) million and $2.4
million, respectively. The 2003 pre-tax net loss was primarily due to aggregate
impairment of goodwill charges of $63.0 million, for further information, see “Item
8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements—Goodwill.”

All other segments include private
banking and other business services. Other segments also include necessary
adjustments to reconcile segment data to the consolidated financial statements.
Our segment reporting is under continuous refinement. As a result, the other
segments will be subject to large amounts of variability from period to period
as our management reporting and cost allocation process evolves. Other segments’
pre-tax income remained consistent at $5.3 million for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002. For operating segment results, see

“Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements—Segment Reporting.”

Financial Condition

Total assets at December 31,
2003 were $4.5 billion, an increase of $282.2 million from December 31,
2002. Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell
increased by $339.8 million, and investment securities increased by $39.7
million while loans, net of unearned income, decreased by $96.9 million. The
increase in total assets was primarily funded by a $230.7 increase in client
deposits. Between December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, long-term
debt increased by $186.9 million primarily due to the issuance of $150.0
million of zero coupon convertible debt in May 2003. The net proceeds from
the issuance of the convertible debt were largely used to repurchase our common
stock, which resulted in a decrease of stockholders’ equity. The remaining
increase in long-term debt was the result of a change in accounting rules, which
mandated the classification of Trust Preferred Securities as long-term debt, on
a prospective basis.

Federal Funds Sold and
Securities Purchased under Agreement to Resell

Federal funds sold and securities
purchased under agreement to resell totaled a combined $542.5 million at December 31,
2003, an increase of $339.8 million, or 167.7% as compared to
$202.7 million outstanding at the prior year-end. We actively manage
overnight funds between federal funds sold and securities purchased under
agreement to resell and money market mutual funds, based on current interest
rates. The increase in federal funds sold and securities purchased under
agreement to resell was primarily funded by an increase in client deposits of
$230.7 million and a slight shift of funds from short-term investments, due to
higher yields.

Investment Securities

For a description of the accounting policies related
to Investment Securities, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies” and
“Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements—Significant Accounting Policies—Investment
Securities.”

The following
table details the composition of investment securities, which were classified
as available-for-sale and reported at fair value, with the
exception of non-marketable securities that include Federal Reserve Bank
and Federal Home Loan Bank stock, tax credit funds, venture capital fund


investments, and other private equity investments, which were reported
on a cost basis less any identified impairment or reported at fair value using
investment company accounting rules at December 31, 2003, 2002, and
2001.

(1)

Available-for-sale other
equity investments included $8.6 and $7.1 million related to investments owned
by two consolidated limited partnerships, Taurus Growth Partners, L.P. and
Libra Partners, L.P. as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002,
respectively.

(2)

Non-marketable venture capital fund investments
included $30.1 million, $22.1million, and $16.5 million related to SVB
Strategic Investors Fund, L.P., as of December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively.

(3)

Non-marketable other private equity investments
included $10.1 million, $10.0 million, and $5.1 million related to Silicon
Valley BancVentures, L.P., as of December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively.

Available-for-sale investment securities totaled $1.5
billion at December 31, 2003, an increase of $35.2 million, or 2.4%, from
the December 31, 2002 balance of $1.4 billion. The increase in
available-for-sale securities resulted from growth in average client deposits
in excess of loan growth. The change in the composition of investments was the
result of our continuing efforts to diversify the product mix in our investment
portfolio to higher yielding, high quality assets. Short-term money market
mutual funds were reallocated to higher yielding mortgage-backed securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations. We continue to add some duration to the
portfolio due to active interest rate risk management, and have increased the
average life to 1.7 years in 2003 from 1.5 years in 2002. Other notable changes
include the reduction of short-term municipal bonds and an increase in agency
discount notes and debentures.

The increase in nonmarketable securities relates to an
increase in venture capital fund investments of $8.5 million between 2002 and
2003, primarily due to additional investments made by our managed fund, SVB
Strategic Investors, L.P. during the year.

Investment securities totaled $1.5 billion at December 31,
2002, a decrease of $297.5 million, or 16.2%, from the December 31, 2001
balance of $1.8 billion. This decrease resulted from a reallocation of funds to
loans and our common stock repurchase programs during 2002. The decrease in
investment securities was primarily in U.S. Treasury and agency securities,
short-term obligations of states and political subdivisions, and money
market mutual funds. This was partially offset by an increase in


collateralized mortgage
obligations. This shift represents a change in investment portfolio management
as we become more active in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. We
have increased the expected average life of investments in our portfolio to
approximately 1.5 years in 2002 from under 1 year in 2001 by adding higher
yielding, highly liquid agency mortgage-backed securities and other
triple A rated securities. The increase in venture capital fund investments of
$8.1 million between 2001 and 2002 was primarily due to additional investments
made by our managed fund, SVB Strategic Investors, L.P. during the year. The
change in the composition of investments was the result of interest rate
conditions.

Based on December 31, 2003 market valuations, we
had potential unrealized pre-tax warrant gains totaling $7.5 million. We
are restricted from exercising many of these warrants. As of December 31,
2003, we held 1,842 warrants in 1,329 companies, had made investments in 254
venture capital funds, and had direct equity investments in 19 companies, many
of which are private. We also had investments in 20 venture capital funds
through our fund of funds, SVB Strategic Investors, L.P. and had direct equity
investments in 25 companies through our venture capital fund, Silicon Valley
BancVentures, L.P. We are typically contractually precluded from taking steps
to secure the current unrealized gains associated with many of these equity
instruments. Hence, the amount of income we realize from these equity
instruments in future periods may vary materially from the current unrealized
amount due to fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock
of these companies.

At December 31, 2003, we held no investment
securities that were issued by a single party, excluding securities issued by
the U.S. Government or by U.S. government agencies and corporations, which
exceeded 10.0% of our stockholders’ equity.


The following
table provides the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable-equivalent
yields on investment securities as of December 31, 2003, except for
auction rate securities that use the next reset date as the maturity date. The
weighted-average yield is computed using the amortized cost of available-for-sale
securities, which are reported at fair value. Expected remaining maturities of
callable U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and
collateralized mortgage obligations may differ significantly from their
contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay
obligations with or without penalties. This is most apparent in mortgage backed
securities and collateralized mortgage obligations as contractual maturities
are typically 15 to 30 years whereby expected average lives of these securities
are between two and five years. Warrant securities, venture capital fund
investments, other private equity investments, Federal Reserve Bank stock,
Federal Home Loan Bank stock, and tax credit funds were included in the table
below as maturing after 10 years.

Callable U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed
securities, and collateralized mortgage obligations pose risks not associated
with fixed maturity bonds, primarily related to the ability of the borrower to
call or prepay the debt with or without penalty. This risk, known as prepayment
risk, may result in these securities having longer or shorter average lives
than that anticipated at the time of purchase. As interest rates decline,
prepayments generally tend to increase, causing the average expected remaining
maturity to shorten. Conversely, as interest rates rise, prepayments tend to
decrease causing the average expected remaining maturity to extend.


Loans

The following
table details the composition of the loan portfolio, net of unearned income,
for each of the past five years:

The following
table sets forth the remaining contractual maturity distribution of our gross
loans at December 31, 2003 for fixed and variable rate loans:

Upon maturity, loans satisfying
our credit quality standards may be eligible for renewal. Such renewals are
subject to the normal underwriting and credit administration practices
associated with new loans. We do not grant loans with unconditional extension
terms.

A substantial percentage of our
loans are commercial in nature, and such loans are generally made to emerging
growth or middle-market companies in a variety of industries. As of December 31,
2003, our software tools and applications industry subsector represented 13.8%
of total gross loans, our premium wineries industry sector represented 15.5% of
total gross loans, and our venture capital industry subsector represented 13.7%
of total gross loans. No other industry sector represented more than 10.0% of
total gross loans at December 31, 2003.

Loan Administration

Authority over our loan policies
resides with our board of directors. This authority is managed through the
approval and periodic review of our loan policies. The board of directors
delegates authority to the directors’ loan committee to supervise our loan
underwriting, approval, and monitoring activities. The directors’ loan
committee consists of outside board of director members and our chief executive
officer, who serves as an alternate.

Subject to the oversight of the
directors’ loan committee, lending authority is delegated to the chief credit
officer and our internal loan committee, which consists of the chief executive
officer, chief credit officer, chief banking officer, chief strategy officer,
and other senior members of our lending management. Requests for new and
existing credits that meet certain size and underwriting criteria may be
approved outside of our internal loan committee by designated senior lenders or
jointly with a senior credit officer.


Credit Quality and the Allowance for Loan Losses

For a description of the
accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses, see “Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Critical Accounting Policies” and “Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements—Significant Accounting Policies—Loans—Allowance for Loan Losses.”

The following
table presents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the past five
years:

The following
table displays the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among specific
classes of loans.

The allowance for loan losses is
allocated based on a historical loan loss formula allocation for similarly risk-rated
loans, or for specific risk issues, which suggest a probable loss factor
exceeding the historical loan loss formula allocation for a specific loan, or
for individual impaired loans as determined by SFAS No. 114.

The allowance for loan losses
totaled $64.5 million at December 31, 2003, a decrease of
$6.0 million, or 8.5%, as compared to $70.5 million at December 31,
2002. Our improved credit quality necessitated a decrease in the allowance for
loan losses. This decrease was due to net recoveries of $0.2 million and a
provision for loan losses of $(6.2) million. Our loan recoveries in 2003
included settlement of the remaining film loan litigation. The 2003 net
recovery amount was composed of $20.1 million in gross charge-offs and
$20.4 million in gross recoveries.

The allowance for loan losses
totaled $70.5 million at December 31, 2002, a decrease of $1.9 million,
or 2.6%, as compared to $72.4 million at December 31, 2001. This decrease
was due to net charge-offs of $5.8 million and a provision for loan
losses of $3.9 million. Our loan recoveries in 2002 primarily related


to film loans,
which were charged-off in 2000. The 2002 net charge-off amount was
composed of $27.9 million in gross charge-offs and $22.2 million in gross
recoveries.

The 2001 gross charge-offs
included one entertainment credit totaling $3.8 million. Of the total 2001
gross charge-offs, $4.9 million were classified as nonperforming loans at
the end of 2000. The 2001 gross recoveries included three credits, one from our
technology industry sector and two from our discontinued entertainment and
healthcare niches, totaling $12.0 million.

The unallocated component of the
allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2001 decreased $14.3 million
from 2000. The decrease in the unallocated allowance between 2000 and 2001,
principally reflects our management’s decision to provide an additional
allocation of the allowance for loan losses for our early-stage product
loan portfolio. No such specific allocation existed at December 31, 2000.
Early-stage product loans represent approximately 20% of our total loan
portfolio and are defined by us as loans made to nonpublic, emerging growth,
technology and life science companies that have not yet attained profitability.
We determined that an additional allocation of the allowance for loan losses
was necessary as our early-stage product loan portfolio experienced higher
than normal annualized gross loan losses that ranged from approximately 7% to
10% during each of the last three fiscal quarters of 2001. Therefore, our
management established an additional allocation to specifically address
potential loan losses from this portfolio.

The 2000 gross charge-offs
included three entertainment credits totaling $23.1 million and two commercial
credits totaling $12 million in our healthcare services industry sector. Of the
total 2000 gross charge-offs, $13.4 million were classified as
nonperforming loans at the end of 1999.

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming
assets consist of loans that are past due 90 days or more that are still
accruing interest, loans on nonaccrual status, other real estate owned (OREO),
and other foreclosed assets. The table below sets forth certain data and ratios
between nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets, and the allowance for loan
losses. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, our nonaccrual loans represented all
impaired loans. We measure all loans placed on nonaccrual status for impairment
based on the fair value of the underlying collateral or the net present value
of the expected cash flows in accordance with SFAS No. 114, “Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.” For all periods presented, nonperforming
loans equaled nonperforming assets.


Nonaccrual Loans

The detailed
composition of nonaccrual loans is presented in the following table.

Nonperforming Loans

Nonperforming loans totaled $12.4 million at December 31,
2003, a decrease of $8.0 million, or 39.5%, from the $20.4 million total
at December 31, 2002. The reduction in non-performing loans reflects the
improved economic conditions experienced by our clients as well as our ability
to effectively manage client credit risk through our strategic focus on the
technology, life sciences, premium winery, and private equity industries. Of
the total nonperforming loans at year-end 2002, $2.3 million were charged
off, $1.2 million remained on nonperforming status, and $16.9 million were
repaid during 2003. Additionally, $11.2 million in loans were placed on
nonperforming status during 2003 and were still classified as nonperforming
loans at the end of 2003.

Nonperforming loans totaled $20.4 million at December 31,
2002, an increase of $2.1 million, or 11.5%, from the $18.3 million total
at December 31, 2001. Of the total nonperforming loans at year-end
2001, $8.4 million were charged off, $1.6 million remained on nonperforming
status, $8.0 million were repaid during 2002, and $0.3 were upgraded to
performing status. Additionally, $15.8 million in loans were placed on
nonperforming status during 2002 and were still classified as nonperforming
loans at the end of 2002.

Nonperforming loans totaled $18.3 million at December 31,
2001, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.4%, from the $18.4 million total at December 31,
2000. Of the total nonperforming loans at year-end 2000, $4.9 million were
charged off, $2.8 million remained on nonperforming status, and $10.7 million
were repaid during 2001. Additionally, $15.5 million in loans were placed on
nonperforming status during 2001 and were still classified as nonperforming
loans at the end of 2001.

Nonperforming loans totaled $18.4 million at December 31,
2000, a decrease of $10.1 million, or 35.4%, from the $28.5 million total at December 31,
1999. Of the total nonperforming loans at year-end 1999, $13.4 million were
charged off, $1.1 million remained on nonperforming status and $14.0 million
were repaid during 2000. Additionally, $17.3 million in loans were placed on
nonperforming status during 2000 and still classified as nonperforming loans at
the end of 2000.

In addition to the loans
disclosed in the foregoing analysis as of January 31, 2004, we have
identified two loans with principal amounts aggregating approximately $4.7
million, that, on the basis of information known to us, were judged to have a
higher than normal risk of becoming nonperforming. We are not aware of any
other loans where known information about possible problems of the borrower
cast serious doubts about the ability of the borrower to comply with the loan
repayment terms.

Goodwill

Substantially all of our goodwill pertains to the
acquisition of Alliant Partners, and a minor portion relates to the acquisition
of Woodside Asset Management, Inc. During 2003, we conducted our annual
valuation analyses of these reporting units, primarily based on forecasted
discounted cash flow analyses. The valuation analysis of Woodside Asset
Management, Inc. reporting unit indicated no impairment.


However, Alliant Partners’
results of operations in 2003 were substantially below forecasted performance.
Therefore, as required by SFAS No.142 in measuring the goodwill impairment
amount, we made a hypothetical allocation of the reporting unit’s estimated
fair value to the tangible and intangible assets (other than goodwill). The
valuation analyses performed on this reporting unit, as of June 30, 2003,
and again as of December 31, 2003, indicated impairment of goodwill of
$17.0 million and $46.0 million, respectively. We expensed these amounts as
impairment charges to continuing operations during the second and fourth
quarters of 2003, respectively. Thus, the total goodwill balance was $37.5
million at December 31, 2003, reduced from $100.5 million at December 31,
2002.

Deposits

Our deposits
are largely obtained from clients within our technology, life sciences, and
premium winery industry sectors, and, to a lesser extent, from individuals
served by our private banking division. We do not obtain deposits from
conventional retail sources and have no brokered deposits. The following table
presents the composition of our deposits for the last five years:

Total deposits were $3.7 billion at December 31,
2003, an increase of $230.7 million, or 6.7%, from the prior year-end
total of $3.4 billion. The increase in deposits reflects an improved funding
environment, increasing venture capital fund activity, and our various
initiatives to drive business. Our noninterest-bearing demand deposits
increased $294.2 million, or 15.6%, and money market deposits increased $147.3
million or 15.8%. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in time
deposits of $210.1 million, or 35.7% from the prior year-end.

Total deposits were $3.4 billion at December 31,
2002, an increase of $55.2 million, or 1.6%, from the prior year-end
total of $3.4 billion. Although our total period end client deposit balances
remained fairly consistent between 2002 and 2001, we experienced a shift in the
composition of deposit balances. Our noninterest-bearing demand deposits
increased $154.5 million, or 8.9%, and money market deposits increased $38.3
million or 4.3%. These increases were largely offset by a decrease in time
deposits of $133.7 million, or 18.5% from the prior year-end.

The aggregate amount of time deposit
accounts individually exceeding $100,000 totaled $333.6 million at December 31,
2003 and $530.5 million at December 31, 2002. At December 31,
2003, substantially all time deposit accounts exceeding $100,000 were scheduled
to mature within one year. No material portion of our deposits has been
obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not
materially affect our business.

Convertible Subordinated
Debt

On May 20, 2003, we issued
$150.0 million of zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes at face value,
due June 15, 2008, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act of 1933 and outside the United States to non-US
persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The notes are convertible
into our common stock at a conversion price of $33.6277 per share and are
subordinated to all our present and future senior debt. Holders of the notes
may convert their notes only under certain conditions. Please see “

Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Footnote 11.
Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt” for additional discussion.


7.0% Junior Subordinated
Debentures

On October 30, 2003, we
issued $51.5 million in 7.0% Junior Subordinated Debentures. A portion of the
proceeds were used to redeem the existing $40.0 million of 8.25% Trust
Preferred Securities. The remainder of the proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes. For further information, see “

Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements—Footnote 11. Short-term Borrowings
and Long-term Debt.”

Capital Resources

Our management seeks to maintain
adequate capital to support anticipated asset growth and credit risks, and to
ensure that Bancshares and Silicon Valley Bank are in compliance with all
regulatory capital guidelines. Our primary sources of new capital include the
issuance of common stock, as well as retained earnings.

Common Stock

$160.0 million share
repurchase program authorized by our board of directors, effective May 7,

On May 7, 2003, we announced
that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to
$160.0 million. This program became effective immediately and replaced
previously announced stock repurchase programs. Under this program, we
repurchased in aggregate 4.5 million shares of common stock totaling $113.2
million in 2003. On May 20, 2003, we purchased 1.3 million shares of
common stock for approximately $33.4 million in conjunction with our
convertible note offering. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2003, we
entered into an accelerated stock repurchase (ASR) agreement for approximately
3.2 million shares at an initial price of $79.9 million. We completed our
settlement obligations under this ASR agreement in the third quarter of 2003. See
below for terms of this agreement, which are substantially the same as ASR
agreements we entered into in January 2003 and November 2002.

$100.0 million share repurchase
program authorized by our board of directors on September 16, 2002

From its inception through its
termination on May 7, 2003, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of common
stock totaling $94.3 million in conjunction with the $100.0 million share repurchase
program. Under this program, we had repurchased 3.3 million shares of common
stock totaling $59.7 million during 2002. A portion of the share repurchases
under this program was completed under an ASR agreement; see below for terms of
the agreement.

$50.0 million share
repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on March 21, 2002

During 2002, we repurchased 2.3
million shares of common stock totaling $50.2 million in conjunction with this
program.

Accelerated Stock
Repurchase Agreements

In May 2003, January 2003, and November 2002,
we entered into accelerated stock repurchase (ASR) agreements to facilitate the
repurchase of shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2003, we had
completed all of our obligations under the ASRs. We purchased 3.2 million, 1.7
million, and 2.3 million shares of common stock from the counterparty for
initial purchase prices of $79.9 million, $29.9 million, and $40.0 million
under the ASR agreements of May 2003, January 2003, and November 2002,
respectively. The agreements had a five-year term. During the term of the
agreements, we had an obligation to sell shares to the counterparty equal to
the number of shares we purchased from them at the outset of the agreement. We
had the option to fulfill our obligation either by buying shares in the open
market and selling those shares to the counterparty at forward prices specified
in the agreement or by issuing new shares and remitting them to the
counterparty in exchange for the forward price. The forward price was based on
a formula that began with the price of the initial purchase and was adjusted
for fees and commissions and the length of time from the initial purchase to
when shares were sold or delivered to the counterparty. We had complete
discretion as to the timing and number of shares that we sold to the
counterparty subject to a cumulative minimum of 20% by the end of each year of
the agreement.


We accounted for the initial
payment under the ASRs as a purchase of treasury stock, and we subsequently
retired those shares. The obligation under the forward contract was not
recorded in our financial statements, but, rather, treated as a contingent
obligation. Under the agreements, the number of shares to be issued by us, if
we were required to pay the counterparty and elected to net settle in shares,
was capped.

Stockholders’ Equity

Stockholders’ equity totaled $447.0 million at December 31,
2003, a decrease of $143.3 million, or 24.3%, from the $590.4 million
balance at December 31, 2002. This decrease in 2003, as compared to 2002,
was primarily due to the repurchase of 6.4 million shares of common stock for
an aggregate purchase price of $147.8 million, partially offset by net
income of $12.0 million and stock issuances under employee stock purchase
and option programs. We have not paid a cash dividend on our common stock since
1992, and we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as
of December 31, 2003.

Funds generated through retained
earnings are a significant source of capital and liquidity and are expected to
continue to be so in the future. Our management engages in a periodic capital
planning process in an effort to make effective use of the capital available to
us. The capital plan considers capital needs for the foreseeable future and
allocates capital to both existing business activities and expected future
business activities. Expected future activities for which capital is set aside
include potential product expansions and acquisitions of new business lines.
Once capital is allocated to both existing and future business needs,
management determines if any excess capital is available. If there is,
management recommends to the board of directors action steps to use the excess
capital. In 2003, excess capital was used to repurchase shares. In the future,
excess capital may be used to continue repurchases or pay dividends. As of December 31,
2003, there are no plans for payment of dividends or repurchases in excess of
those already disclosed above.

Credit Rating

In December 2003, Standard & Poor’s
Rating Services assigned Silicon Valley Bancshares its “BBB-” long-term
counterparty credit. Standard & Poor’s assigned its “BBB” counterparty
credit rating to Silicon Valley Bank. An issuer rated “BBB” is defined as
having an adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments, however, adverse
economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a
weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitments. According
to Standard & Poor’s, the outlook for both Silicon Valley Bancshares
and Silicon Valley Bank is stable.

Silicon Valley Bancshares’ credit
rating by Moody’s Investor Service (“Moody’s”) at December 31, 2003 was “Baa1”
for issuer rating. According to Moody’s, issuers rated “Baa1” offer adequate
financial security. However, certain protective elements may be lacking or may
be unreliable over any great period of time. Silicon Valley Bank’s credit
rating by Moody’s at December 31, 2003 was “A3” for issuer rating, “A3”
for long-term deposits, “P-2” for short-term deposits, and “C” for
financial strength. Moody’s bank deposit ratings are opinions of a bank’s
ability to repay punctually its foreign and/or domestic currency deposit
obligations. According to Moody’s an “A” rating for deposits represents good
credit quality, however, elements may be present that suggest a susceptibility
to impairment over the long-term. Banks rated “P-2” by Moody’s, for short-term
deposits offer strong credit quality and a strong capacity for timely payment
of short-term deposit obligations. Financial strength ratings represent
Moody’s opinion of a bank’s intrinsic safety and soundness and, as such,
exclude certain external credit risks and credit support elements that are
addressed by Moody’s bank deposit ratings. Banks rated “C” possess adequate
intrinsic financial strength and are typically institutions with more limited
but still valuable business franchises, good financial fundamentals, and a
predictable and stable operating environment. According to Moody’s, the outlook
for both Silicon Valley Bancshares and Silicon Valley Bank is stable.

Liquidity

Another important objective of asset/liability
management (ALCO) is to manage liquidity. The objective of liquidity management
is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet loan


demand, to meet depositors’
needs, and to service other liabilities as they become due without causing an
undue amount of cost or risk and without causing a disruption to normal
operating conditions.

We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of
projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical
deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and
economic conditions, individual client funding needs, and existing and planned
business activities. Our ALCO provides oversight to the liquidity management
process and recommends policy guidelines, subject, to our board of directors’
approval, and courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity
needs.

The ability to attract a stable, low-cost base
of deposits is our primary source of liquidity. We continue to expand on
opportunities to increase our liquidity. In the third quarter of 2002, we
became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco adding to our
liquidity channels. Other sources of liquidity available to us include federal
funds purchased, reverse repurchase agreements, and other short-term
borrowing arrangements. Our liquidity requirements can also be met through the
use of our portfolio of liquid assets. Our definition of liquid assets includes
cash and cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry
out normal business operations, federal funds sold, securities purchased under
resale agreements, investment securities maturing within six months, investment
securities eligible and available for financing or pledging purposes with a
maturity in excess of six months, and anticipated near-term cash flows
from investments.

Our policy guidelines provide that liquid assets as a
percentage of total deposits should not fall below 20.0%. Our ratio of liquid
assets to total deposits was 48.6% and 43.7% at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, both well in excess of our minimum policy guidelines. In
addition to monitoring the level of liquid assets relative to total deposits,
we also utilize other policy measures in our liquidity management activities.
As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we were in compliance with all of these
policy measures.

In analyzing our liquidity during 2003, reference is
made to our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31,
2003; see “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.” The statement of cash flows includes separate categories for operating,
investing, and financing activities. Operating activities included net income
of $12.0 million for 2003, which was adjusted for certain non-cash
items including impairment of goodwill, provision for loan losses,
depreciation, deferred tax assets, and an assortment of other miscellaneous
items resulting in cash generated from operations. Investing activities
consisted of transactions in investment securities resulting in a net cash
outflow of $50.7 million and the net change in total loans, which resulted
in a net cash inflow of $76.2 million in 2003. The net cash inflow related
to loans relate to principal collections offset by loan originations. The net
cash outflow from securities transactions were the net result of purchases of
investment securities, offset by securities maturities and sales. Financing
activities reflected cash inflows of $234.1 million primarily resulting from a
large increase in deposits and inflows from the issuance of zero-coupon
convertible notes and 7.0% Junior Subordinated Debentures. Financing cash
outflows resulted from repurchases of common stock and redemption of our 8.25%
Trust Preferred Securities. In total, the transactions noted above resulted in
a net cash inflow of $352.4 million for 2003 and total cash and cash
equivalents, as defined in our consolidated statement of cash flows, of
$795.0 million at December 31, 2003.

On a stand-alone basis,
Bancshares’ primary liquidity channels include dividends from Silicon Valley
Bank, its investment portfolio assets, and its ability to raise debt and
capital. The ability of Silicon Valley Bank to pay dividends is subject to
certain regulations, see “Item 1. Business—Supervision and
Regulation—Restriction on Dividends.”


Financial Ratios

The table
below presents the relationship between the following significant financial
ratios:

Both Silicon
Valley Bancshares’ and Silicon Valley Bank’s capital ratios were in excess of
regulatory guidelines for a well-capitalized depository institution as of
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001. See “Item 8. Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 23 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements—Regulatory Matters.” The decreases in our Tier 1
risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios from 2002 to 2003 have been
caused in large part to reductions in additional paid in capital and retained
earnings due to our stock repurchases in 2002 and 2003. Capital ratios for
Silicon Valley Bancshares are set forth below:

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk
Management

A key objective of asset/liability management is to
manage interest rate risk associated with changing asset and liability cash
flows and market interest rate movements. Interest rate risk occurs when
interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities do not re-price
simultaneously both in timing and volume. Our asset/liability committee (ALCO)
provides oversight to our interest rate risk management process and recommends
policy guidelines regarding exposure to interest rates for approval by our
board of directors. Adherence to these policies is monitored on an ongoing
basis, and decisions related to the management of interest rate exposure are
made when appropriate.

We manage interest rate risk principally through
strategies involving our investment securities portfolio. Our policies permit
the use of off-balance sheet derivative instruments in managing interest
rate risk.

Our monitoring activities related
to managing interest rate risk include both interest rate sensitivity gap
analysis and the use of a simulation model. While traditional gap analysis
provides a simple picture of the interest rate risk embedded in the balance
sheet, it provides only a static view of interest rate sensitivity at a
specific point in time and does not measure the potential volatility in
forecasted results relating to changes in market interest rates over time.
Accordingly, we combine the use of gap analysis with use of a simulation model
that provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity.

Interest Rate Sensitivity
Analysis

The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the
difference between the amount of interest-earning assets and interest
sensitive liabilities that are anticipated to re-price within a specific
time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate
sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities re-pricing
within that same time period. Positive cumulative gaps in early time periods
suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates rise. Negative
cumulative gaps suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates fall.
The gap analysis as of December 31, 2003 indicates that the cumulative one-year
gap as a percentage of interest-earning assets was a positive 36%.


The following table illustrates
our interest rate sensitivity gap positions at December 31, 2003:

Interest
Rate Sensitivity Analysis as of December 31, 2003

Includes interest-bearing deposits
in other financial institutions of $1.8 million as of December 31, 2003.

2003.

(5)

Maturity/repricing columns for fixed rate loans are
based upon the amount and timing of related principal payments as of December 31,
2003.


Market Value of Portfolio
Equity (MVPE)

One application of the aforementioned simulation model
involves measurement of the impact of market interest rate changes on the net
present value of estimated cash flows from our assets, liabilities, and off-balance
sheet items, defined as our market value of portfolio equity (MVPE). This
analysis assesses the changes in market values of interest-rate-sensitive
financial instruments that would occur in response to an instantaneous and
sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of 100 and 200 basis
points and the resulting effect on our MVPE. Policy guidelines establish
maximum variances in our MVPE of 20.0% and 30.0% in the event of an
instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of
100 and 200 basis points, respectively.

The following
table presents our MVPE exposure at December 31, 2003 and December 31,
2002, related to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market
interest rates of 100 and 200 basis points, respectively.

The preceding table indicates that at December 31,
2003, in the event of an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in
market interest rates, our MVPE would be expected to respectively increase or
decrease accordingly.

The market value calculations supporting the results
in the preceding table are based on the present value of estimated cash flows
using both market interest rates provided by independent broker/dealers and
other publicly available sources that we deem reliable. These calculations do
not contemplate any changes that we could make to reduce our MVPE exposure in
response to a change in market interest rates.

As with any method of measuring interest rate risk,
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the
preceding table. For example, although certain of our assets and liabilities
may have similar maturity or re-pricing profiles, they may react to
changes in market interest rates with different magnitudes. Also, actual
prepayment rates on loans and investments could vary substantially from the
assumptions utilized in the model in deriving the results as presented in the
preceding table. Further, a change in the shape of the forward yield curve
could result in different MVPE estimations from those presented herein.
Accordingly, the results in the preceding table should not be relied upon as
indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates.
Additionally, the resulting MVPE estimates are not intended to represent, and
should not be construed to represent the underlying value.

The simulation model also gives us the ability to
simulate our net interest income using an interest rate forecast (simple
simulation). In order to measure the sensitivity of our forecasted net interest
income to changing interest rates utilizing the simple simulation methodology,
both a rising and falling interest rate scenario were projected and compared to
a base market interest rate forecast derived from the current yield curve. For
the rising and falling interest rate scenarios, the base market interest rate
forecast was increased or decreased, as applicable, by 200 basis points in
12 equal increments over a one-year period.


In addition to the 200 basis point ramp scenario
mentioned above we run net interest income and net income simulations in an
interest rate environment whereby we shock the base rate immediately both up
and down 100 basis points. The combination of the ramp and shock scenarios
provides us with additional information with respect to our sensitivity to
interest rates and the impact on our net income under varied interest rate
scenarios.

Our policy guidelines provide that the difference
between a base market interest rate forecast scenario over the succeeding
one-year period compared with the aforementioned rising and falling interest
rate scenarios over the same time period should not result in net interest
income sensitivity exceeding 20.0%. Simulations as of December 31, 2003
indicated that we were well within these policy guidelines.

Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk
impacting us. Other types of market risk affecting us in the normal course of
our business activities include foreign currency exchange risk, equity price
risk, and basis risk. The impact resulting from these market risks is not
considered significant and no separate quantitative information concerning
market rate and price exposure is presented herein.

Our MVPE exposure at December 31,
2003 increased slightly from December 31, 2002 primarily due to changes in
the investment portfolio while staying well within our policy guidelines. In
addition, our net interest income at risk remains well within policy limits.
These estimates are highly assumption-dependent and will change regularly
as the company’s asset-liability structure changes and as different
interest rate environments evolve. We expect to continue to actively manage our
interest rate risk utilizing on and off-balance sheet strategies as
appropriate.

Factors That May Affect
Future Results

Our business faces significant risks. The factors
described below may not be the only risks we face, and is not intended to serve
as a comprehensive listing. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that
we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If
any of the events or circumstances described in the following factors actually
occur, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could
suffer.

If a significant number of
clients fail to perform under their loans, our business, profitability, and
financial condition would be adversely affected.

As a lender, the largest risk we
face is the possibility that a significant number of our client borrowers will
fail to pay their loans when due. If borrower defaults cause losses in excess
of our allowance for loan losses, it could have an adverse effect on our
business, profitability, and financial condition. We have established an
evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan
losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective
information, the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses
are dependent to a great extent on our experience and judgment. We cannot
assure you that our allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to absorb
future loan losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business,
profitability or financial condition.

Because of the credit
profile of our loan portfolio, our levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs
can be volatile, and we may need to make material provisions for loan losses in
any period, which could cause reduced net income or increased net losses in
that period.

Our loan portfolio has a credit
profile different from that of most other banking companies. Many of our loans
are made to companies in the early stages of development with negative cash
flow and no established record of profitable operations. In many cases,
repayment of the loan is dependent upon receipt of additional equity financing
from venture capitalists or others. Collateral for many of the loans often
includes intellectual property, which is difficult to value and may not be
readily salable in the case of default. Because of the intense competition and
rapid technological change that characterizes the companies in our technology
and life science industry sectors, a borrower’s financial position can
deteriorate rapidly. We also make loans that are larger, relative to the
revenues of the borrower, than those made by traditional small business
lenders, so the impact of any single borrower default may be more significant
to us. Because of these characteristics, our level of nonperforming loans and
loan


charge-offs can
be volatile and can vary materially from period to period. Changes in our level
of nonperforming loans may require us to make material provisions for loan
losses in any period, which could reduce our net income or cause net losses in
that period.

Our current level of
interest rate spread may decline in the future. Any material reduction in our
interest spread could have a material impact on our business and profitability.

A major portion of our net income
comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the
interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and
other borrowings, and the interest rates we receive on interest-earning assets,
such as loans extended to our clients and securities held in our investment
portfolio. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our
control, such as inflation, recession, global economic disruptions, and
unemployment. In addition, legislative changes could affect the manner in which
we pay interest on deposits or other liabilities. For example, Congress has for
many years debated repealing a law that prohibits banks from paying interest
rates on checking accounts. If this law were to be repealed, we would be
subject to competitive pressure to pay interest on our clients’ checking
accounts, which would negatively affect our interest rate spread. Any material
decline in our interest rate spread would have a material adverse effect on our
business and profitability.

Decreases in the amount of
equity capital available to start-up and emerging growth companies could
adversely affect our business, profitability, and growth prospects.

Our strategy has focused on providing banking products
and services to emerging growth and middle-market companies receiving financial
support from sophisticated investors, including venture capitalists, “angels,”
and corporate investors. In some cases, our lending credit decision is based on
our analysis of the likelihood that our venture capital or angel-backed client
will receive a second or third round of equity infusion from investors. The
amount of capital available to startup and emerging growth companies has
decreased in the past three years, which has caused our client deposit balances
to decline. If the amount of capital available to such companies continues to
decrease, it is likely that the number of new clients and investor financial
support to our existing borrowers could decrease, having an adverse effect on
our business, profitability and growth prospects.

Among the factors that have and
could in the future affect the amount of capital available to startup and
emerging growth companies are the receptivity of the capital markets to initial
public offerings or mergers and acquisitions of companies within our technology
and life science industry sectors, the availability and return on alternative
investments, and general economic conditions in the technology and life
sciences industries. Over the past three years, the stock prices of many
technology and life science companies have declined substantially, and the
capital markets have been less receptive to initial public offerings. Reduced
capital markets valuations could further reduce the amount of capital available
to startup and emerging growth companies, including companies within our
technology and life science industry sectors.

Our business is dependent
upon access to funds on attractive terms.

We derive our net interest income
through lending or investing capital on terms that provide returns in excess of
our costs for obtaining that capital. As a result, our credit ratings are
extremely important to our business. A reduction in our credit ratings could
adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing
costs (or trigger obligations under certain existing borrowings and other
contracts), or increase the interest rates we pay our depositors. Further, our
credit ratings and the terms upon which we have access to capital may be
influenced by circumstances beyond our control, such as overall trends in the
general market environment, perceptions about our creditworthiness or market
conditions in the industries in which we focus.

We are subject to
extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and impose
financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business.

Silicon Valley Bancshares, Silicon
Valley Bank, and their subsidiaries are extensively regulated under federal and
state law. These regulations are intended primarily for the protection of
depositors, other


clients, and
the deposit insurance fund—not for the benefit of stockholders or security
holders. Federal and state laws and regulations limit or otherwise affect the
activities in which Silicon Valley Bancshares, Silicon Valley Bank, and their
subsidiaries may engage. A change in the applicable statutes, regulations, or
regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business and that of our
subsidiaries. In addition, Silicon Valley Bancshares, Silicon Valley Bank and
their subsidiaries are required to maintain certain minimum levels of capital.
Federal and state banking regulators possess broad powers to take supervisory
action, as they deem appropriate, with respect to Silicon Valley Bancshares and
Silicon Valley Bank. Alliant Partners and SVB Securities, both broker-dealer
subsidiaries, are regulated by the SEC and the NASD. Violations of the
stringent regulations governing the actions of a broker-dealer can result in
the revocation of broker-dealer licenses, the imposition of censures or fines,
the issuance of cease and desist orders, and the suspension or expulsion from
the securities business of a firm, its officers or employees. Supervisory
actions can result in higher capital requirements, higher insurance premiums,
and limitations on the activities of Silicon Valley Bancshares, Silicon Valley
Bank or their subsidiaries. These supervisory actions could have a material
adverse effect on our business and profitability.

Warrant, venture capital
fund, and direct equity investment portfolio gains or losses depend upon the
performance of the portfolio investments and the general condition of the
public equity markets, which is uncertain.

We have historically obtained
rights to acquire stock, in the form of warrants, in certain clients as part of
negotiated credit facilities. We may not be able to realize gains from warrants
in future periods, or our realized gains may be materially less than the
current level of unrealized gains disclosed in this filing. We also have made
investments in venture capital funds as well as direct equity investments in
companies. The timing and amount of income, if any, from the disposition of
client warrants, venture capital funds and direct equity investments typically
depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the
underlying portfolio companies, investor demand for initial public offerings,
fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock of these
companies, levels of mergers and acquisitions activity, and legal and
contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities. In
addition, our investments in venture capital funds and direct equity
investments have lost value and could continue to lose value or become
worthless, which would reduce our net income or could cause a net loss in any
period. All of these factors are difficult to predict, particularly in the
current economic environment. If equity market conditions do not improve, it is
likely that additional investments within our existing portfolio will become
impaired. However, we are not in a position to know at the present time which
specific investments, if any, are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing
of individual impairments. Therefore, we cannot predict future investment gains
or losses with any degree of accuracy, and any gains or losses are likely to
vary materially from period to period.

Public offerings and
mergers and acquisitions involving our clients can cause loans to be paid off
early, which could adversely affect our business and profitability.

While an active market for public
equity offerings and mergers and acquisitions generally has positive
implications for our business, one negative consequence is that our clients may
pay off or reduce their loans with us if they complete a public equity offering
or are acquired or merge with another company. Any significant reduction in our
outstanding loans could have a material adverse effect on our business and
profitability.

Adverse changes in
domestic or global economic conditions, especially in the technology sector and
particularly in California, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, growth, and profitability.

If conditions worsen in the
domestic or global economy, especially in the technology sector, our business,
growth and profitability are likely to be materially adversely affected. Many
of our technology clients have been harmed by the current economic slowdown,
and would be further harmed by the continuation or worsening of the global or
U.S. economic slowdown. Our clients may be particularly sensitive to
disruptions in the growth of the technology sector of the U.S. economy. In
addition, a substantial number of our clients are geographically concentrated
in California, and adverse economic


conditions in
California could harm the businesses of a disproportionate number of our
clients. To the extent that our clients’ underlying businesses are harmed, they
are more likely to default on their loans.

If we fail to retain our
key employees, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.

We rely on experienced client
relationship managers and on officers and employees with strong relationships
with the venture capital community to generate new business. If a significant
number of these employees were to leave us, our growth and profitability could
be adversely affected. We believe that our employees frequently have
opportunities for alternative employment with competing financial institutions
and with our clients.

We cannot assure you that
we will be able to maintain our historical levels of profitability in the face
of sustained competitive pressures.

Other banks and specialty and
diversified financial services companies, many of which are larger and have
more capital than we do, offer lending, leasing, other financial products and
advisory services to our client base. In some cases, our competitors focus
their marketing on our industry sectors and seek to increase their lending and
other financial relationships with technology companies, early stage growth
companies or special industries such as wineries. In other cases, our
competitors may offer a broader range of financial products to our clients.
When new competitors seek to enter one of our markets, or when existing market
participants seek to increase their market share, they sometimes undercut the
pricing and/or credit terms prevalent in that market. Our pricing and credit
terms could deteriorate if we act to meet these competitive challenges.

We face risks in
connection with completed or potential acquisitions.

We completed one acquisition in each of 2002 and 2001
and, if appropriate opportunities present themselves, we intend to acquire
businesses, technologies, services or products that we believe are strategic.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, negotiate or
finance future acquisitions successfully, or to integrate such acquisitions
with our current business.

Future acquisitions could result in potentially
dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, and/or
contingent liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, and/or financial condition. Any such future
acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services or products might
require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be
available on terms favorable to us, or at all; and such financing, if
available, might be dilutive.

Upon completion of an acquisition, we are faced with
the challenges of integrating the operations, services, products, personnel,
and systems of acquired companies into our business, which may divert management’s
attention from ongoing business operations. In addition, acquisitions of new
businesses may subject us to regulatory scrutiny. We cannot assure you that we
will be successful in integrating any acquired business effectively into the
operations of our business. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the
anticipated benefits of any acquisition will be realized.

The success of our acquisitions
is dependent on the continued employment of several key employees. If acquired
businesses do not meet projected revenue targets, or if certain key employees
were to leave the businesses, we could conclude that the value of the
businesses has decreased and that the related goodwill has been impaired. If we
were to conclude that goodwill has been impaired that conclusion would result
in an impairment of goodwill charge to us, which would adversely affect our
results of operations.

We could be liable for
breaches of security in our online banking services. Fear of security breaches
could limit the growth of our online services.

We offer various internet-based services to our
clients, including online banking services. The secure transmission of
confidential information over the internet is essential to maintain our clients’
confidence in our online services. Advances in computer capabilities, new
discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the
technology we use to protect client transaction data. Although we have
developed systems and processes that are designed to prevent security breaches
and periodically


test our security, failure to
mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect our ability to offer and
grow our online services and could harm our business.

People generally are concerned
with security and privacy on the Internet and any publicized security problems
could inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial
transactions. Our ability to provide financial services over the internet would
be severely impeded if clients became unwilling to transmit confidential
information online. As a result, our operations and financial condition could
be adversely affected.

We face risks associated
with international operations.

A component of our strategy is to
expand internationally on a limited basis. Expansion into international
markets, albeit on a limited basis, will require management attention and
resources. We have limited experience in internationalizing our service, and we
believe that many of our competitors are also undertaking expansion into
foreign markets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in
expanding into international markets. In addition to the uncertainty regarding
our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations and to expand our
international presence, there are certain risks inherent in doing business on
an international basis, including, among others, regulatory requirements, legal
uncertainty regarding liability, tariffs, and other trade barriers,
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, longer payment
cycles, different accounting practices, problems in collecting loan payments,
political instability, seasonal reductions in business activity, and
potentially adverse tax consequences, any of which could adversely affect the
success of our international operations. To the extent we expand into
international operations and have additional portions of our international
revenues denominated in foreign currencies, we could become subject to
increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. There
can be no assurance that one or more of the factors discussed above will not
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and/or
financial condition.

Maintaining or increasing
our market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new
products and services.

Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to
adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and client
demands. There is increasing pressure on financial services companies to provide
products and services at lower prices. In addition, the widespread adoption of
new technologies, including internet-based services, could require us to make
substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products or services.
A failure to achieve market acceptance of any new products we introduce, or a
failure to introduce products that the market may demand, could have an adverse
effect on our business, profitability, or growth prospects.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

The Board of Directors and
Stockholders

Silicon Valley Bancshares:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Silicon Valley Bancshares and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Silicon Valley
Bancshares and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Silicon Valley Bancshares and its subsidiaries (the “Company”)
offers its clients financial products and services including commercial,
investment, merchant and private banking, and private equity services, as well
as value-added services using its knowledge and networks. Silicon Valley
Bancshares is a bank holding company and a financial holding company whose
principal subsidiary is Silicon Valley Bank (the “Bank”), a
California-chartered bank, founded in 1983, and headquartered in Santa Clara,
California. The Bank serves more than 9,500 clients across the country, through
its 26 regional offices. The Bank has 13 offices throughout California and
operates regional offices across the country, in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia,
Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. The Bank serves emerging growth
and mature companies in the technology and life sciences markets, as well as
the premium wine industry. Merger, acquisition, private placement and corporate
partnering services are provided through its wholly-owned investment banking
subsidiary, Alliant Partners (“Alliant”), whose offices are in Northern
California and Boston.

The accounting and reporting
policies of the Company conform with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Certain reclassifications have been made to
the Company’s 2002 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2003
presentations. Such reclassifications had no effect on the results of
operations or stockholders’ equity.

Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of Silicon Valley Bancshares and those of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. SVB Strategic Investors, LLC and Silicon Valley BancVentures, Inc.,
as general partners, are considered to have significant influence over the
operating and financing policies of SVB Strategic Investors Fund, L.P. and
Silicon Valley BancVentures, L.P., respectively. Therefore, SVB Strategic
Investors Fund, L.P. and Silicon Valley BancVentures, L.P. are included in the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Minority interest in the capital
of consolidated affiliates primarily represents the minority participants’
share of the equity of SVB Strategic Investors Fund, L.P., and Silicon Valley
BancVentures, L.P.

Similar accounting is applied to
SVB Woodside Financial, the general partner of Taurus Growth Partners, L.P. and
Libra Partners, L.P., see “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Business
Combinations.”

Basis of Financial
Statement Presentation

The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of
the balance sheet date and the results of operations for the reported periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. A material estimate that is
particularly susceptible to possible change in the near term relates to the
determination of the allowance for loan losses. An estimate of possible changes
or a range of possible changes cannot be made.

Revenue recognition

Revenues earned on mergers and acquisitions advisory
services are recognized when Alliant Partners has fully completed its
contractual and regulatory obligations related to its client service
engagements.

Revenues related to client
investment management fees are recognized as earned.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents as
reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows include cash on hand,
cash balances due from banks, federal funds sold, and securities purchased
under agreement to resell. The cash equivalents are readily convertible to
known amounts of cash and present insignificant risk of changes in value due to
maturity dates of 90 days or less.

Federal Funds Sold and
Securities Purchased under Agreement to Resell

Federal funds sold and securities
purchased under agreement to resell as reported in the consolidated balance
sheets include interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions
of $1.8 million and $0 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Investment Securities

Fixed Income Securities

Fixed income investment securities are classified as
held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, trading, or non-marketable
upon purchase or acquisition.

Securities purchased with the ability and positive
intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and
are accounted for at historical cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums
or the accretion of discounts to maturity, where appropriate. The Company did
not have any investments in the held-to-maturity portfolio as of December 31,
2003 or December 31, 2002. Unrealized losses on held-to-maturity
securities become realized and are charged against earnings when it is
determined that an other-than-temporary decline in value has
occurred.

Securities that are held to meet investment objectives
such as interest rate risk and liquidity management, and which may be sold by
the Company as needed to implement management strategies, are classified as
available-for-sale and are accounted for at fair value. Unrealized
gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, after applicable
taxes, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a
separate component of stockholders’ equity, until realized. Unrealized losses
on available-for-sale securities becomes realized and are charged
against earnings when it is determined that an other than temporary decline in
value has occurred. Further, the cost basis of the individual security is
written down to fair value as a new cost basis.

Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on
debt securities are included in interest income over the contractual terms of
the underlying investment securities using the straight-line method,
which approximates the effective interest method.

Securities acquired and held principally for the
purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading and are accounted
for at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from fair value
adjustments on trading securities, as well as gains and losses realized upon
the sale of investment securities, are included in noninterest income. The Company
did not have a trading portfolio as of December 31, 2003 and December 31,
2002.

Non-marketable securities
include Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and tax credit
funds.

Marketable Equity
Securities

Investments in marketable
equity securities include:

·

Unexercised
warrants for shares of publicly-traded companies.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

·

Investments
in shares of publicly-traded companies. Equity securities in the Company’s
warrant, direct equity, and venture capital fund portfolios generally become
marketable when a portfolio company completes an initial public offering on a
publicly-reported market, or is acquired by a publicly-traded company.

·

Marketable
equity securities related to Taurus Growth Partners, L.P. and Libra Partners,
L.P. The Company has a controlling ownership interest of less than 1% in each
of these funds. Both entities were formed to invest client funds in securities
and other investment vehicles, including without limitation, various equity and
fixed income security instruments.

Unrealized
gains or losses on warrant and equity investment securities are recorded upon
the establishment of a readily determinable fair value of the underlying
security, as defined by SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Instruments.”

·

Unrealized
gains or losses after applicable taxes, on available-for-sale marketable equity
securities that result from initial public offerings are excluded from earnings
and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. The Company is often contractually
restricted from selling equity securities, for a certain period of time,
subsequent to the portfolio company’s initial public offering. Gains or losses
on these marketable equity instruments are recorded in the Company’s
consolidated statements of income in the period the underlying securities are
sold to a third party.

·

Gains
or losses on marketable warrant and equity investment securities that result
from a portfolio company being acquired by a publicly-traded company in a
stock-based transaction, are marked to market when the acquisition occurs. The
resulting gains or losses are recognized into income on that date, in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, Issue No. 91-5, “Nonmonetary
Exchange of Cost-Method Investments.” Further fluctuations in the market value
of these marketable equity instruments, prior to eventual sale, are excluded
from earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, which
is a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Upon the sale of these equity
securities to a third party, gains and losses, which are measured from the acquisition
price, are recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.

·

If
the Company possesses a warrant that can be settled with a net cash payment to
the Company, the warrant meets the definition of a derivative instrument. Changes
in fair value of such derivative instruments are recognized as securities gains
or losses in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decline in the fair
value of any of these securities that is considered other than temporary is
recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of income in the period the
impairment occurs. The cost basis of the underlying security is written down to
fair value as a new cost basis.

Summary financial data related to
the Company’s marketable equity securities at December 31, 2003 are
presented in “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data—Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Investment Securities.”

Non-Marketable
Equity Securities

The Company invests in
non-marketable equity securities in several ways:

·

By
direct purchases of preferred or common stock in privately-held companies


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Summary of

·

By
capital contributions to venture capital funds, which in turn, make investments
in preferred or common stock of privately held companies

·

Through
the Company’s venture capital fund, Silicon Valley BancVentures, L.P., which
makes investments in preferred or common stock of privately held companies

·

Through
the Company’s fund of funds, SVB Strategic Investors Fund, L.P., which makes
investments in venture capital funds, which in turn, invest in privately held
companies

Unexercised warrant securities in private companies
are initially recorded at a nominal value on the Company’s consolidated balance
sheets. They are carried at this value until they become marketable or expire.

A summary of
the Company’s accounting policies for other non-marketable equity securities is
presented in the following table. A complete description of the accounting
policies follows the table.

Private
  Equity and Venture Capital Fund Investments

Wholly-Owned by
  Bancshares

Cost basis less identified
  impairment, if any

Owned by Silicon Valley
  BancVentures, L.P. and SVB Strategic Investors Fund, L.P.

Investment company accounting, adjusted to fair value on a quarterly
  basis through the statement of income

The Company records wholly-owned, non-marketable
venture capital fund investments and other direct equity investments on a cost
basis. The Company’s interests are considered minor, as it owns less than 5% of
the company and has no influence over the company’s operating and financial
policies. The Company’s cost basis in each investment is reduced by returns
until the cost basis of the individual investment is fully recovered. Returns
in excess of the cost basis are recorded as investment gains in noninterest
income.

The values of the investments are reviewed at least
quarterly, giving consideration to the facts and circumstances of each
individual investment. The Company’s review of private equity investments
typically includes the relevant market conditions, offering prices, operating
results, financial conditions, and exit strategies. A decline in the fair value
that is considered other than temporary is recorded in the Company’s
consolidated statements of income in the period the impairment occurs. Any
estimated loss is recorded in noninterest income as investment losses.

Investments held by Silicon Valley BancVentures, L.P.
are recorded at fair value using investment accounting rules. The investments
consist of stock in private companies that are not traded on a public market
and are subject to restrictions on resale. These investments are carried at
estimated fair value as determined by the general partner. The valuation
generally remains at cost until such time that there is significant evidence of
a change in values based upon consideration of the relevant market conditions,
offering prices, operating results, financial conditions, exit strategies, and
other pertinent information. The general partner, Silicon Valley BancVentures, Inc.
is owned and controlled by the Company and has an ownership interest of 10.7%
in Silicon Valley BancVentures, L.P. Therefore, Silicon Valley BancVentures,
L.P. is fully consolidated and any gains or losses resulting from changes in
the estimated fair value of the investments are recorded as investment gains or
losses in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. The portion of any
gains or losses belonging to the limited partners is reflected in minority
interest in net gains (losses) of consolidated affiliates and adjusts the
Company’s income to its percentage ownership.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The SVB Strategic Investors Fund, L.P. portfolio
consists primarily of investments in venture capital funds, which are recorded
at fair value using investment accounting rules. The carrying value of the
investments is determined by the general partner based on the percentage of SVB
Strategic Investors Fund, L.P.’s interest in the total fair market value as
provided by each venture capital fund investment. SVB Strategic Investors, LLC
generally utilizes the fair values assigned to the underlying portfolio
investments by the management of the venture capital funds. The estimated fair
value of the investments is determined after giving consideration to the
relevant market conditions, offering prices, operating results, financial
conditions, exit strategy, and other pertinent information. The general
partner, SVB Strategic Investors, LLC, is owned and controlled by the Company
and has an ownership interest of 11.1% in SVB Strategic Investors Fund, L.P. Therefore,
SVB Strategic Investors Fund, L.P. is fully consolidated and any gains or
losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the venture
capital fund investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in the
Company’s consolidated statements of income. The limited partners’ share of any
gains or losses is reflected in minority interest in net gains (losses) of
consolidated affiliates and adjusts the Company’s income to its percentage
ownership.

Summary financial data related to
the Company’s non-marketable equity securities at December 31, 2003
are presented in “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data—Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Investment Securities.”

Loans

Loans are reported at the principal
amount outstanding, net of unearned income. Unearned income includes both
deferred loan origination and commitment fees and costs. The net amount of
unearned income is amortized into loan interest income over the contractual
terms of the underlying loans and commitments using the interest method or the
straight-line method, if not materially different, adjusted for actual
loan prepayment experience.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is
established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense to provide
for credit risk. The Company applies the following evaluation process to its
loan portfolio to estimate the required allowance for loan losses:

The Company maintains a systematic process for the
evaluation of individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan
losses. On a quarterly basis, each loan in its portfolio is assigned a credit
risk-rating. Credit risk-ratings are assigned on a scale of 1 to
10, 1 representing loans with a low risk of nonpayment, 9 representing loans
with the highest risk of nonpayment, and 10 representing loans which have been
charged-off. This credit risk-rating evaluation process includes,
but is not limited to, such factors as payment status, the financial condition
of the borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral
values, potential loan concentrations, and general economic conditions. The
Company’s policies require certain credit relationships that exceed specific
dollar values, be reviewed by a committee of senior management, at least
quarterly. The Company’s review process evaluates the appropriateness of the
credit risk-rating and allocation of allowance for loan losses, as well as
other account management functions. In addition, Management receives and
approves an analysis for all impaired loans, as defined by the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 114 “Accounting by Creditors
for Impairment of a Loan.” The allowance for loan losses is allocated based on
a historical loan loss formula allocation for similarly risk-rated loans,
or for specific risk issues, which suggest a probable loss factor exceeding the


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

historical loan loss formula
allocation for a specific loan, or for individual impaired loans as determined
by SFAS No. 114.

The Company’s evaluation process is designed to
determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The Company assesses
the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio by utilizing modeling
techniques. For this purpose the Company has developed a statistical model
based on historical loan loss migration to estimate an appropriate allowance
for outstanding loan balances. In addition, the Company applies macro and
contingent allocations to the results of the aforementioned model to ascertain
the total allowance for loan losses. While this evaluation process uses
historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the
establishment of the allowance for loan losses relies, to a great extent, on
the judgment and experience of the Company’s management.

The Company’s allowance for loan
losses is established for loan losses that are probable but not yet realized.
The process of anticipating loan losses is imprecise. The Company’s allowance
for loan losses is its best estimate using the historical loan loss experience
and its perception of variables potentially leading to deviation from the
historical loss experience.

Nonaccrual Loans

SFAS No. 114, “Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan” and SFAS No. 118, “Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan-Income Recognition and Disclosures” requires the
Company to measure impairment of a loan based upon the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate,
except that as a practical expedient, the Company may measure impairment based
on the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if
the loan is collateral-dependent. A loan is considered impaired when,
based upon currently known information, it is deemed probable that the Company
will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of
the agreement.

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become
90 days past due as to principal or interest payments (unless the principal and
interest are well secured and in the process of collection), when the Company
has determined, based upon currently known information, that the timely collection
of principal or interest is doubtful, or when the loans otherwise become
impaired under the provisions of SFAS No. 114, “Accounting by Creditors
for Impairment of a Loan.”

When a loan is placed on
nonaccrual status, the accrued interest is reversed against interest income and
the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method thereafter until
qualifying for return to accrual status. Generally, a loan will be returned to
accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest become current in
accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and full collection of the
principal and interest appears probable.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are reported at cost, less
accumulated depreciation and amortization computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the
related leases, whichever is shorter. This time period may range from one to 10
years. The Company had no capitalized lease obligations at December 31,
2003 and 2002.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

The Company enters into foreign
exchange contracts with clients involved in international trade finance
activities. The Company also enters into an opposite-way foreign exchange
contract with a correspondent bank, which completely mitigates the risk of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for each of the contracts
entered into with its clients. However, settlement, credit, and operational
risks remain. The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for
any other purposes. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments
and are recorded at fair value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately in non-interest
income.

Income Taxes

The Company files a consolidated
federal income tax return, and consolidated or combined state income tax
returns as appropriate. The Company’s federal and state income tax provisions
are based upon taxes payable for the current year as well as current year
changes in deferred taxes related to temporary differences between the tax
basis and financial statement balances of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements at
currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the
deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized. As changes in
tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted
through the provision for income taxes.

Stock-Based
Compensation

The Company has elected to follow Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(“APB No. 25”), and related interpretations, in accounting for its
employee stock options rather than the alternative fair value accounting
allowed by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”
as amended by SFAS No.148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition
and Disclosure.” APB No. 25 provides that the compensation expense
relative to the Company’s employee stock options is measured based on the
intrinsic value of the stock option. SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148
requires companies that continue to follow APB No. 25 to provide a
pro-forma disclosure of the impact of applying the fair value method of SFAS No. 123.
The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving
Stock Compensation.”

Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Had compensation cost
related to both the Company’s stock option awards to employees and directors
and to the ESPP been determined under the fair value method prescribed under
SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net income, basic earnings per share, and
diluted earnings per share would have been the pro-forma amounts below, for
2003, 2002, and 2001:

See “Item 8. Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 18 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements—Employee Benefit Plans” for assumptions used in
calculating the pro-forma amounts above.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share (EPS) excludes
dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if contracts to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in
the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity.

Segment Reporting

Prior to January 1, 2002,
the Company operated as one segment. On January 1, 2002, the Company reorganized
into five lines of banking and financial services for management reporting:
Commercial Banking, Merchant Banking, Investment Banking, Private Banking, and
Other Business Services. See “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data—Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements—Segment Reporting.”

Derivative Financial
Instruments

The Company accounts for
derivative instruments in accordance with the provisions of

SFAS No. 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”
SFAS No. 149 amended and provided clarification on the accounting for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts and for hedging activities under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149 was to be applied prospectively and was
effective for contracts entered into or modified


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

after June 30, 2003. This
statement will be applicable to existing contracts and new contracts entered
into after June 30, 2003 if those contracts relate to forward purchases or
sales of when-issued securities or other securities that do not yet exist. The
adoption of SFAS No. 149 has had no material impact on the Company’s
results of operations or financial condition.

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by SFAS No. 138,
“Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,”
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, and
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at
fair value. Additionally, the accounting for changes in fair value depends on
whether the derivative instrument is designated and qualifies as part of a
hedging relationship and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity. Changes in
the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment, as well
as the ineffective portion of a particular hedge, must be recognized currently
in earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a
fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the
offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized in earnings in the current period, unless the derivative instrument
meets the qualification for the short-cut treatment, as defined by SFAS No. 133.
See “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data—Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Derivative Financial
Instruments.” For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a
cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the effective portion of the
derivative instrument are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). These
amounts are reclassified from OCI and recognized in earnings when either the
forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable that the forecasted
transaction will not occur.

Business Combinations

The Company accounts for business
combinations in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations,” which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used
for all business combinations. SFAS No. 141 also specifies the criteria
that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must
meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. See “Item 8.
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements—Business Combinations.”

Goodwill and Other
Intangibles

The Company accounts for intangible assets in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead tested
for impairment at least annually.

Goodwill, which arises from the purchase price
exceeding the assigned value of the net assets of acquired business, represents
the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired.

On an annual basis or as circumstances dictate, the
Company reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may
indicate impairment in the carrying amount. The evaluation methodology for
potential impairments is inherently complex, and involves significant judgment
in the use of estimates and assumptions. Impairment is evaluated using a
two-step process. First, the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit is
compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds
the carrying amount, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of the
reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then the “implied” fair value, defined
below, is compared to the reporting unit’s goodwill with its carrying amount.
If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then
goodwill impairment is recognized by writing goodwill down to the implied fair
value.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The Company primarily uses a discounted future cash
flows approach to value the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill
impairment. These estimates involve many assumptions, including expected
results of operations, assumed discounts rates, and assumed growth rates for
the reporting units. The discount rate used is based on standard industry
practice, taking into account the expected equity risk premium, the size of the
business, and the probability of the reporting unit achieving its financial
forecasts. The implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of
the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the
unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit
was the purchase price.

Events that may indicate goodwill
impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or
political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
unanticipated competition; and a more likely-than-not expectation that a
reporting unit will be sold or disposed of.

Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liability and Equity

The Company accounts for financial instruments with
characteristics of both liability and equity according to the provisions of
SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150, issued by
the FASB in May 2003, established standards for how an issuer classifies
and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both
liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial
instrument that is within the Statement’s scope as a liability (or an asset in
some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously classified as
equity, or between the liabilities and equity sections of the statement of
financial position. SFAS No. 150 requires financial instruments issued in
the form of shares that are mandatorily redeemable (or embodies an
unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem it by transferring its
assets at a specified or determinable date or upon an event that is certain to
occur) to be classified as liabilities. The statement is effective for
financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and
otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning
after June 15, 2003. It is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle for financial instruments created
before the issuance date of the Statement and still existing at the beginning
of the interim period of adoption. Restatement is not permitted.

The Company’s $40.0 million of “Company
Mandatorily Redeemable Trust Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust Holding
Solely Junior Subordinated Debentures,” or 8.25% Trust Preferred Securities,
were redeemed on December 1, 2003. Beginning July 1, 2003, under SFAS
No. 150, the 8.25% Trust Preferred Securities were classified under the
liabilities section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet and 8.25% Trust Preferred
Securities distribution expense was classified under interest expense on the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 150,
these securities were classified between the liability and equity sections of
the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and their related expense was
classified as noninterest expense on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
Income, under the heading “Trust preferred securities distributions.”

Accounting for Variable
Interest Entities

The Company accounts for variable interest entities
according to the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIE),” or FIN No. 46R. FIN No. 46R
was issued to replace FIN No. 46, and to clarify the required accounting
for interests in variable interest entities. A VIE is an entity that does not
have sufficient equity investments at risk, or the holders of the equity instruments
lack the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest. A VIE
is to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of
the risk of loss from the VIE’s activities, or is entitled to receive a
majority of the entity’s residual returns, or both.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

1. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

As of December 31, 2003, the
Company has completed its evaluation of VIEs and has not consolidated any VIEs
in its financial statements, in accordance with the provisions of FIN No. 46R.
In accordance with these provisions, the Company has not consolidated SVB
Capital II, a special purpose trust formed in October 2003, for the
purpose of issuing 7.0% Trust Preferred Securities. Implementation of FIN No. 46R
did not have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations or
financial condition.

2. Business Combinations

On October 1, 2002, the Company acquired
substantially all of the assets of Woodside Asset Management, Inc., an
investment advisor firm, which has approximately $200 million under management
for 70 clients. Woodside Asset Management, Inc. is expected to enable
the Company to expand its product offerings in the private banking.
Additionally, as part of this acquisition, Silicon Valley Bancshares obtained
the general partner interests in two limited partnerships, Taurus Growth Partners,
L.P., and Libra Partners, L.P., with total assets aggregating $12.3 million at
December 31, 2003. The Company has less than a 1% ownership interest in each of
these funds. The remaining ownership interest represents limited partners’
funds invested on their behalf by the general partner in certain fixed income
and marketable equity securities. However, due to the Company’s ability to
control the investing activities of these limited partnerships, the Company has
consolidated the related results of operations and financial condition into its
consolidated financial statements, since the date of acquisition. This
acquisition did not have a material impact on goodwill.

On September 28, 2001, the
Company completed its acquisition of Alliant Partners and has included its
results of operations in the Company’s consolidated results of operations since
that date. The acquisition has allowed the Company to strengthen its investment
banking platform for its clients. The Company agreed to purchase the assets of
Alliant for a total of $100.0 million, due in several installments of cash
and/or common stock. These installments are payable over four years between September 30,
2001 and September 30, 2005. As of December 31, 2003, the first three
installments aggregating $81.3 million have been paid in cash, and the
remaining $18.7 million, which was discounted at prevailing forward market
interest rates of approximately 3.3% at the time of purchase, are recorded as
short-term and long-term debt. In addition to the fixed purchase
price, the sellers received certain contingent purchase price payments
including 75% of the pre-tax income of Alliant for the twelve-month
period ended September 28, 2002. Furthermore, the Company shall pay to the
sellers an amount equal to fifteen times the amount by which Alliant’s
cumulative after-tax net income from October 1, 2002 to September 30,
2005 exceeds $26.5 million, provided, however, that the aggregate amount of any
deferred earn-out payment payable shall not exceed $75.0 million. The Company
also agreed to make retention payments aggregating $5.0 million in equal
annual installments on September 28, 2003, 2004, and 2005, of which the
first installment was paid in late 2003. The purchase price was allocated to
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on the estimated net fair
values at the date of acquisition of approximately $0.5 million. The excess of
purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was
recorded as goodwill. The business combinations were recorded in accordance
with SFAS No. 141. See “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 1, Note 9, and Note 11 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements—Significant Accounting Policies, Goodwill, and Short-term
Borrowings and Long-term Debt.”

million that had unrealized losses of $(0.8) million for a period of greater

classified as a collateralized mortgage obligation. It was originally purchased
in December 2002, and had unrealized losses of less than $(0.04) million in
2003, due solely to market movements and therefore, not deemed to be
permanently impaired. The two remaining securities totaled $9.2 million and had
unrealized losses of $(0.8) million in 2003. These are auction rate preferred
securities and are classified as commercial paper and other debt securities.
The unrealized losses were the result of a credit downgrade from A1 to Baa2,
effective June 25, 2002. The securities continue to be investment grade and the
Company has deemed the impairment as temporary. Market valuations and

7. Loans and the Allowance for
Loan Losses

The detailed
composition of loans, net of unearned income of $12.3 million and $11.8 million
at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, is presented in the following
table:

The Company’s loan classifications for financial
reporting purposes differ from those for regulatory reporting purposes. Loans
are classified for financial reporting purposes based upon the purpose and
primary source of repayment of the loans. Loans are classified for regulatory
reporting purposes based upon the type of collateral securing the loans.

A substantial percentage of the Company’s loans are
commercial in nature, and such loans are generally made to emerging growth or
middle-market companies in a variety of industries. As of December 31,
2003, the Company’s software tools and applications industry subsector
represented 13.8% of total loans, premium wineries industry sector represented
15.5% of total loans, and venture capital industry subsector represented 13.7%
of total loans. No other industry sector represented more than 10.0% of total
loans at December 31, 2003.

The activity
in the allowance for loan losses is summarized below:

The aggregate recorded investment in loans for which
impairment has been determined in accordance with SFAS No. 114 totaled
$12.4 million and $20.4 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. During 2003 and 2002, nonaccrual loans represented all impaired
loans. Allocations of the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans
totaled $3.1 million at December 31, 2003 and $6.5 million at December 31,
2002. Average impaired loans for 2003, 2002, and 2001 totaled $15.6 million,
$19.6 million, and $21.6 million, respectively. If these loans had not been
impaired, $1.0 million, $1.3 million, and $2.1 million in interest income would
have been realized during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and
2001, respectively. The Company realized no interest income on such impaired
loans during 2003, 2002 or 2001.

8. Premises and Equipment

Premises and
equipment consist of the following:

The Company
is obligated under a number of noncancelable operating leases for premises that
expire at various dates, through 2011, and in most instances, include options
to renew or extend at market rates and terms. Such leases may provide for
periodic adjustments of rentals during the term of the lease based on changes
in various economic indicators. The following table presents minimum payments
under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2003:

Rent expense for premises leased
under operating leases totaled $11.0 million, $13.7 million, and $10.2 million
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In
2002, the Company exited leased premises, located in Santa Clara, California,
approximating 18,000 square feet. The lease on the building will expire in August 2005.
The management determined that the premises would have no future economic value
to the Company’s operations, except for any potential future sub-lease
arrangement. Therefore, during 2002, the Company incurred charge-offs of
approximately $2.5 million related to the exit of these premises.

9. Goodwill

Substantially all of the Company’s goodwill pertains to
the acquisition of Alliant Partners, and a minor portion relates to the
acquisition of Woodside Asset Management, Inc.

During 2003, the Company conducted its annual
valuation analyses of these reporting units, primarily based on forecasted
discounted cash flow analyses. The valuation analysis of Woodside Asset
Management, Inc. reporting unit indicated no impairment.

However, Alliant Partners’
results of operations in 2003 were substantially below forecasted performance.
Therefore, as required by SFAS No.142 in measuring the goodwill impairment
amount, the Company made a hypothetical allocation of the reporting unit’s
estimated fair value to the tangible and intangible assets (other than
goodwill). The valuation analyses performed on this reporting unit, as of June 30,
2003, and again as of December 31, 2003, indicated impairment of goodwill
of $17.0 million and $46.0 million, respectively. The Company expensed these
amounts as impairment charges to continuing

operations
during the second and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively. Thus, the total
goodwill balance was $37.5 million at December 31, 2003, reduced from
$100.5 million at December 31, 2002.

10. Deposits

The aggregate amount of time
deposit accounts individually exceeding $100,000 totaled $333.6 million
and $530.5 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest
expense paid on time deposits individually exceeding $100,000 totaled $3.2
million and $6.7 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December 31,
2003, time deposit accounts, individually exceeding $100,000, totaling $333.0
million were scheduled to mature within one year.

11. Short-term Borrowings and
Long-term Debt

The following
table represents the outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt at December 31,
2003, December 31, 2002, and December 31, 2001:

Partners and are payable to the former owners, who were employed by the Company
at December 31, 2003. These notes were discounted over their respective terms,
based on market interest rates as of September 28, 2001.

Interest expense related to short-term
borrowings was $0.3 million, $1.1 million, and $0.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Interest expense and
amortization of issuance cost related to long-term debt was $4.1 million,
$0.6 million and $0.2 million, for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002, and 2001, respectively. See “Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2 and Note 19—Business
Combinations and Related Parties.”

On May 20, 2003, the Company issued $150.0
million of zero-coupon, convertible subordinated notes at face value, due June 15,
2008, to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act of 1933 and outside the United States to non-US persons pursuant
to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The notes are convertible into the
Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $33.6277 per share and are
subordinated to all present and future senior debt of the Company. Holders of
the notes may convert their notes only if: (i) the price of the Company’s
common stock issuable upon conversion of a note reaches a specified threshold, (ii) specified
corporate transactions occur, or (iii) the trading price for the notes

principal amount of notes will be convertible into approximately 29.7374 shares
of the Company’s

common stock. The Company filed a
shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the notes and the
common stock issuable upon the conversion of the notes with the SEC on August 14,
2003. The fair value of the convertible subordinated notes at December 31,
2003 was $178.7 million, based on quoted market prices. The Company intends to
repay the principal of the notes in cash.

Concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes,
the Company entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with
respect to its common stock, with the objective of limiting its
exposure to potential dilution from conversion of the notes. The terms and
conditions of the convertible note hedge are disclosed in  “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data—Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Derivative
Financial Instruments.”  The
proceeds of the warrant transaction were included in stockholders’ equity
in accordance with the guidance in Emerging Task Force Issue No. 00-19,
“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled
in, a Company’s Own Stock.”  Under the
warrant agreement, Credit Suisse First Boston LLC (the Counterparty) may
purchase up to approximately 4.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock
at $51.34 per share, upon the occurrence of conversion events. The warrant
transaction will expire on June 15, 2008.

The Company had available federal
funds and lines of credit facilities totaling $140.0 million, which were unused
at December 31, 2003.

7.0% Junior Subordinated
Debentures

On October 30, 2003, the Company issued $51.5
million in 7.0% Junior Subordinated Debentures to a newly formed
special-purpose trust, SVB Capital II. SVB Capital II is a variable interest
entity as defined by the provisions of FIN No. 46, which is effective for
reporting periods subsequent to December 15, 2003. The Company has not
been deemed to have the highest potential for risk of loss or benefit from SVB
Capital II. Therefore, SVB Capital II has not been consolidated. Distributions
to SVB Capital II are cumulative and are payable quarterly at a fixed rate of
7.0% per annum of the face value of the Junior Subordinated Debentures. The
Junior Subordinated Debentures are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of
the debentures on October 15, 2033, or to the extent of any earlier redemption
of any debentures by the Company. The Company may redeem the debentures prior
to maturity in whole or in part, at its option, at any time on or after October 30,
2008. In addition, the Company may redeem the debentures, in whole but not in
part, prior to October 30, 2008 upon the occurrence of certain events.
Issuance costs of $2.2 million related to the Junior Subordinated Debentures
were deferred and are being amortized over the period until mandatory
redemption of the debentures in October 2033. The Company used the net
proceeds to redeem $40.0 million of its existing 8.25% Trust Preferred
Securities, which were held by SVB Capital I. The Company intends to use the
remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include,
investment in, or extension of credit to, its subsidiaries.

On October 30, 2003, the
Company entered into an interest rate swap, which

hedges against the
risk of changes in fair values associated with the Company’s $50.0 million,
7.0% fixed rate, Junior Subordinated Debentures. This derivative agreement
provided

a $0.4 million decrease in interest
expense for 2003. For further information, see “Item 8. Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements—Derivative Financial Instruments.”

Based on the closing market price, the fair value of
the 7.0% Junior Subordinated Debentures totaled $49.2 million as of December 31,
2003.

12. Trust Preferred Securities

8.25% Fixed Rate Trust Preferred Securities

In May 1998, the Company
issued $40.0 million in cumulative Trust Preferred Securities through a newly
formed special-purpose trust, SVB Capital I. These 8.25% Trust Preferred
Securities were redeemed effective December 1, 2003. The trust was a
wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company and its sole assets were
the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures. Distributions were
cumulative and were payable quarterly at a rate of 8.25% per annum of the
stated liquidation amount of $25 per preferred security. The obligations of the
trust were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, by
the Company. At the time of redemption, the remaining unamortized issuance
costs of  $1.3 million related to the
Trust Preferred Securities were expensed

.

On June 3,
2002, the Company entered into interest rate swap, which

hedged against
the risk of changes in fair values associated with the Company’s $40.0 million,
8.25% fixed rate, Trust Preferred Securities. This agreement provided

a benefit of $1.0 million and $1.1 million in 2003
and 2002, respectively. The swap was terminated on June 23, 2003. For
further information, see “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements—Derivative Financial Instruments.”

Please see the section under

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both
Liabilities and Equity.”

13. Derivative
Financial Instruments

Derivative instruments that the
Company uses as a part of its interest rate risk management may include
interest rate swaps, caps, and floors and forward contracts. On October 30,
2003, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional
amount of $50.0 million. This agreement hedges against the risk of changes in
fair values associated with the Company’s $50.0 million, 7.0% fixed rate,
Junior Subordinated Debentures. For information on the company’s $50.0 million
Junior Subordinated Debentures, s

ee “Item 8.
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements—Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt.”

The terms of this interest rate
hedge agreement provide for a swap of the Company’s 7.0% fixed rate payment for
a variable rate based on London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. Because
the swap meets the criteria for the short cut treatment, the benefit or expense
is recorded in the period incurred. This derivative agreement provided a
benefit of $0.4 million in 2003. The swap agreement mirrors the terms of the
Junior Subordinated Debentures and therefore is callable by the counterparty
anytime after October 30, 2008. The Company assumes no ineffectiveness as
the swap agreement meets the short-cut method requirements under SFAS No. 133
for fair value hedges of debt instruments. As a result, changes in the fair
value of the swap are offset by changes in the fair value of the Junior
Subordinated Debentures, and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings.

Changes in the fair value of the derivative
agreement and the

Junior Subordinated Debentures

are primarily dependent on changes in market interest rates. The
derivative instrument had a fair value of $0.3 million, which was recorded in
other assets at December 31, 2003.

On May 15, 2003, the Company entered into a
convertible note hedge agreement (purchased call option) with Credit Suisse
First Boston LLC (the Counterparty) with respect to its common stock, to limit
its exposure to potential dilution from conversion of the Company’s $150.0
million principal amount of zero coupon convertible notes. For information on
the Company’s $150.0 million principal amount of zero coupon convertible notes,
please see “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data—Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Short-term
Borrowings and Long-term Debt.”  Upon the
occurrence of conversion events, the Company has the right to purchase up to
approximately 4.4 million of its common stock from the Counterparty at a price
of $33.6277 per common share. The convertible note hedge agreement will expire
on June 15, 2008. The Company has the option to settle

any amounts due
under the convertible hedge either in cash or net shares of its common stock. The
cost of the convertible note hedge is included in stockholders’ equity in
accordance with the guidance in Emerging Task Force Issue No. 00-19, “Accounting
for Derivative Financial Instruments

Indexed
to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock.”

On June 3, 2002, the Company
entered into an interest swap agreement with a notional amount of $40.0
million. The swap was terminated effective June 23, 2003. This agreement
hedged against the risk of changes in fair value associated with the Company’s
$40.0 million, 8.25% fixed rate, Trust Preferred Securities. The 8.25% Trust
Preferred Securities were redeemed in December 2003. This derivative
agreement provided a benefit of $1.0 million and $1.1 million in 2003 and
2002, respectively. The derivative instrument had a fair value of $0.8 million
that was recorded in other assets at December 31, 2002. The other terms
of this derivative agreement were substantially the same as those of the
interest rate swap the Company entered into in October 2003.

Foreign Currency Option Contracts, see “Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees, and Other Commitments.”

14. Segment
Reporting

The Company is organized into
five lines of banking and financial services for management reporting:
Commercial Banking, Merchant Banking, Investment Banking, Private Banking, and
Other Business Services. These operating segments are strategic units that
offer different services to different clients. They are managed separately
because each segment appeals to different markets and, accordingly, requires
different strategies. The results of operating segments are based on the
Company’s management reporting process, which assigns assets, liabilities,
income, and expenses to the aforementioned operating segments. This process is
dynamic and, unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive,
authoritative guidance for management reporting equivalent to generally
accepted accounting principles. The management reporting process measures the
performance of operating segments based on the Company’s management structure
and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial
services companies. Changes in the management structure and/or the allocation
process have resulted and may in the future result in changes in the Company’s
allocation methodology as this process is under constant refinement. In the
event of such changes, results for prior periods have been and may be restated
for comparability. Results for the year ended 2002 have been restated to
reflect changes in the Company’s allocation methodology.

As of December 31, 2003,
based on the quantitative threshold for determining reportable segments as
required by SFAS No. 131 “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information,” the Company’s reportable segments are: Commercial
Banking, which is the principal operating segment of the Company, Merchant
Banking, Investment Banking, and the remaining segments.

Prior to January 1, 2002,
the Company operated as one segment. In 2002, the Company’s principal operating
segment was the Commercial Bank, and the other segments did not meet segment
reporting criteria. 2001 results have not been restated to reflect the Company’s
current reportable segments, due to certain data not being available to us.
2001 results are shown reflecting the Commercial Bank as the Company’s
principal operating segment.

Commercial Banking provides lending services, which
include traditional term loans, commercial finance lending, and structured
finance lending. Commercial Banking’s cash management services unit provides
deposit services, collection services, disbursement services, electronic funds
transfers, and online banking through SVBeConnect. Commercial Banking’s
International services unit provides trade services, foreign exchange services,
export trade finance, and international cash management. Also, Commercial
Banking provides investment and advisory services through the Silicon Valley
Bank’s broker-dealer subsidiary, SVB Securities, which includes mutual funds,
fixed income securities, and investment reporting and monitoring.

14. Segment
Reporting

(Continued)

Merchant Banking makes private equity and venture
capital fund investments, international alliances and manages two limited
partnerships: a venture capital fund and a fund of funds. Merchant Banking also
provides the lending, deposit, cash management, international, and investment
banking services to venture capital firms and other private equity firms.

Investment Banking provides merger and acquisition,
private placements, and corporate partnering services through the Company’s
broker-dealer subsidiary, Alliant Partners.

Other segments include Private Banking and Other
Business Services. Private Banking provides a wide array of loan, personal
asset management, mortgage services, trust and estate planning tailored for
high-net-worth individuals. It also provides investment advisory services to
these clients through the Company’s Woodside Asset Management, Inc.,
subsidiary. The Other Business Services unit provides Web-based business
services and professional services. Other segments also includes necessary
adjustments to reconcile segment data to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company’s
primary source of revenue is from net interest income. Thus, the Company’s
segments are reported below using net interest income. The Company also
evaluates performance based on noninterest income and noninterest expense
goals, which are also presented as measures of segment profit and loss. The
Company does not allocate income taxes to the segments.

(1)

For operating
segment reporting purposes, the Company reports net charge-offs as the
provision for loan losses. Thus, the Other segment includes $(6.0) million  and $(1.9) million for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which represent the difference
between net charge-offs and the provision for loan losses.

(2)

Noninterest
income presented in the Merchant Banking segment included warrant income of
$7.5 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

(3)

Commercial
Banking segment included depreciation and amortization of $1.4 million and $1.2
million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Investment banking includes impairment of goodwill charges of $63.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003.

(4)

Total average
assets equals the greater of total average loans or the sum of total average
deposits and total average stockholders’ equity for each segment. Certain
adjustments are included in the Other segment to reconcile segment assets to
total average assets reported on a consolidated basis. Total average assets
presented in the Investment Banking segment included goodwill primarily related
to the Alliant acquisition of $81.6 million and $98.6 million for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

15. Common Stock Repurchases

$160.0 million share
repurchase program authorized by the board of directors, effective May 7,

On May 7, 2003, the Company’s
announced that its board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of
up to $160.0 million. This program became effective immediately and replaced previously
announced stock repurchase programs. Under this program, the Company
repurchased in aggregate 4.5 million shares of common stock totaling $113.2
million in 2003. On May 20, 2003, the Company purchased 1.3 million shares
of common stock for approximately $33.4 million in conjunction with the Company’s
convertible note offering. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2003, the
Company entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement (ASR) for 3.2
million shares at an initial price of $79.9 million. The Company completed its
settlement obligations under this ASR agreement in the third quarter of 2003. See
below for terms of this ASR, which are substantially the same as ASR agreements
entered into in January 2003 and November 2002.

$100.0 million share
repurchase program authorized by the board of directors on September 16,

From its inception through its
termination on May 7, 2003, the Company repurchased 5.2 million shares of
common stock totaling $94.3 million in conjunction with the $100.0 million
share repurchase program. Under this program, the Company had repurchased 3.3
million shares of common stock totaling $59.7 million during 2002. A portion of
the shares repurchased under this program was completed under an ASR agreement;
see below for terms of this agreement.

Accelerated Stock
Repurchase Agreements

In May 2003, January 2003, and November 2002,
the Company entered into accelerated stock repurchase (ASR) agreements to
facilitate the repurchase of shares of its common stock.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
completed all of its settlement obligations under these ASRs.

The
Company repurchased 3.2 million, 1.7 million, and 2.3 million shares of its
common stock from the counterparties for $79.9 million, $29.9 million, and
$40.0 million under the ASR agreements of May 2003, January 2003, and
November 2002, respectively. These agreements had a five-year term.
During the term of the agreements, the Company had an obligation to sell shares
to the counterparty equal to the number of shares the Company purchased from
them at the outset of the agreement. The Company had the option to fulfill its
obligation either by buying shares in the open market and selling those shares
to the counterparty at forward prices specified in the agreement or by issuing
new shares and remitting them to the counterparty in exchange for the forward
price. The forward price was based on a formula that began with the price of
the initial purchase and was adjusted for fees and commissions and the length
of time from the initial purchase to when shares were sold or delivered to the
counterparty. The Company had complete discretion as to the timing and number
of shares that the Company sold to the counterparty subject to a cumulative
minimum of 20% by the end of each year of the agreement.

The Company accounted for the
initial payment under the ASRs as a purchase of treasury stock, and the Company
subsequently retired those shares. The obligation under the forward contract
was not recorded in the Company’s financial statements, but, rather, treated as
a contingent obligation. Under the agreements, the number of shares to be
issued by the Company, if the Company were required to pay the counterparty and
elected to net settle in shares, was capped.

Qualified Investors Fund LLC

Equity Incentive Plans

Each of the Company’s active
stock option plans has been approved by its stockholders. The Company’s 1997
Equity Incentive Plan (the “1997 Plan”), provides for the granting of incentive
and nonstatutory stock options which entitle directors, employees, and certain
other parties to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a price not
less than 100% and 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date
the option is granted for incentive and nonstatutory stock options,
respectively. Options may vest over various periods not in excess of five years
from the date of grant and expire five to ten years from the date of grant. In
2003, the board of directors of the Company approved an amendment to the Plan,
which provides that the exercise price of each nonstatutory stock option shall
be not less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of
the stock subject to the option on the date the option is granted and will be
in lieu of cash compensation.

Benefit Plans

(Continued)

The table below provides stock
option information related to the 1989 stock option plan and the 1997 Plan:

The following
table summarizes information about stock options outstanding as of December 31,
2003:

At December 31, 2003, options for 1,110,729
shares were available for future grant under the Company’s 1997 plan. There
were no shares available for future grant under the Company’s 1983 and 1989
stock option plans.

The Company’s 1997 Plan provides for the granting of
shares of the Company’s common stock to directors, employees, and certain other
parties. Shares granted to employees under this plan may be subject to certain
vesting requirements and resale restrictions (restricted stock). For restricted
stock, unearned compensation equivalent to the market value of the Company’s
common stock on the date of grant is charged to stockholders’ equity and
amortized into noninterest expense over the vesting term. In 2003, 116,777
shares of restricted stock were issued to employees at a weighted-average fair
value of $17.24 per share. In 2002 and 2001, the Company did not issue
restricted stock. At December 31, 2003, there were 293,673 shares of
restricted stock outstanding, and the vesting of these shares occurs at various
periods through the years 2004 and 2005.

The Company recognized $1.1 million, $0.8 million and
$1.7 million in employee stock-based compensation costs resulting from
the amortization of unearned compensation related to restricted stock,

stock options and other miscellaneous
employee stock awards during 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

The weighted-average fair values of options
granted to employees, directors and certain other parties were $12.08, $10.69
and $14.96 per share in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Had compensation
cost related to both the Company’s stock option awards to employees and
directors and to the ESPP been determined under the fair value method
prescribed under SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net income, basic earnings
per share and diluted earnings per share would have been the pro forma amounts
shown in “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data—Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies—Stock-based Compensation.”

The fair value
of the stock option grants in 2003, 2002, and 2001 used in determining the pro
forma net income and the basic and diluted earnings per share amounts were
estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following assumptions:

The expected volatility of the Company’s underlying
common stock was calculated using a one-year term. The expected risk-free
interest rate was calculated using a term commensurate with the expected life
of the options.

Compensation expense related to the
ESPP in 2003, 2002 and 2001, used in determining the pro forma net income and
basic and diluted earnings per share amounts, was equal to the difference
between the fair value of the Company’s common stock when issued under the ESPP
and the actual price paid by employees to acquire the common stock.

Silicon Valley Bank 401(k)
and Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The Silicon Valley Bank 401(k) and Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (the “Plan”) is a combined 401(k) tax-deferred savings
plan and employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) in which all regular employees of
the Company are eligible to participate.

Effective January 1, 2003, employees
participating in the 401(k) component of the Plan are allowed to contribute up
to 75% of their pre-tax compensation as defined in the plan, up to the
maximum amount allowable under federal income tax regulations ($12,000 in
2003.) Effective January 1, 2003, the Company matches dollar-for-dollar,
up to 5% of each employee’s contribution to the 401(k) plan, which vests
immediately. Prior to January 1, 2003, the Company matched up to $1,000 of
an employee’s contributions, per annum, which vested at 20% per year. The
Company’s matching 401(k) contributions totaled $3.0 million in 2003, $0.9
million in 2002 and $0.8 million in 2001. The amount of salary deferred is
not subject to federal or state income taxes at the time of deferral.

18. Employee Benefit Plans
(Continued)

Effective December 31, 2002, the Company merged
the Silicon Valley Bank Money Purchase Pension Plan (the “MPP Plan”) balances
into the 401(k) plan, which continue to vest at 20% per year. The Company has
not made contributions towards the MPP in 2003 and will not in the future.
Prior to December 31, 2002, the MPP Plan guaranteed a quarterly
contribution to all individuals who were employed by the Company on the first
and last day of a fiscal quarter. The Company contributed cash in an amount
equal to 5.0% of an eligible employee’s quarterly base salary, less Internal
Revenue Code (IRC) Section 401(k) and Section 125 deferrals. The
Company’s contributions to the MPP Plan totaled $3.4 million in 2002 and $2.7
million in 2001.

Discretionary ESOP contributions, based on the Company’s
net income, are made by the Company to all eligible individuals employed by the
Company on the last day of the fiscal year. The Company may elect to contribute
cash, or the Company’s common stock, in an amount not exceeding 10.0% of the
employee’s eligible compensation earned in the fiscal year. The ESOP
contributions vest in equal annual increments over five years.

The Company’s contributions to
the ESOP totaled $3.8 million in 2003, $0.4 million in 2002, and $0 in 2001. At
December 31, 2003, the ESOP owned 1,006,089 shares of the Company’s common
stock. All shares held by the ESOP are treated as outstanding shares in both
the Company’s basic and diluted earnings per share computations. At December 31,
2003, the company had zero shares committed to the ESOP program.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

The Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan
(ESPP) under which participating employees may annually contribute up to 10.0%
of their gross compensation to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at
85% of its fair market value at either the beginning or end of each six-month
offering period, whichever price is less. All employees of the Company are
eligible to participate in the ESPP. The ESPP is noncompensatory to the
employees and results in no expense to the Company. For the first six-month
offering period of 2003, 92,408 shares of the Company’s common stock were
issued at $15.86 per share, while 73,233 shares of the Company’s common stock were
issued at $20.24 per share for the second six-month offering period of
2003. At December 31, 2003, a total of 1,291,623 shares of the Company’s
common stock were reserved for future issuance under the ESPP Plan.

Employee Home Ownership
Plan

In 2002, the Company approved a benefit plan, the
Employee Home Ownership Plan (EHOP), which provides for the issuance of
mortgage loans to eligible employees at favorable interest rates. Eligible
employees may apply for a fixed rate mortgage on their primary residence, which
is amortized over 30 years and is due and payable in five years. Applicants
must qualify for a loan through the usual mortgage review and approval process,
which is typical of industry standards. The maximum loan amount cannot be
greater than 80.0% of the lesser of the purchase price or the appraised value.
The interest rate on the note is written at the then market rate of 5 year
(5/1) mortgage loans as determined by the Company. However, provided that the
applicant continues to meet all of the eligibility requirements, including
employment at the Company, the actual rate charged to the borrower shall be
2.0% below the market rate. The loan rate shall not be less than 25 basis
points over the greater of either the five-year Treasury Note rate or the
monthly Applicable Federal Rate for medium term loans as published by the IRS.

SVB Qualified Investors
Fund LLC

In late 2000, the Company formed
SVB Qualified Investor Fund LLC, on behalf of certain eligible employees. The
fund was initially fully capitalized by equity contributions by employees. The
funds principal purpose is to invest in a select number of private equity funds
managed primarily by Silicon Valley Bancshares or its affiliates. The fund will
continue until December 12, 2013, unless terminated sooner or extended in
accordance with the fund operating agreement. The Company incurred fund
administration costs of approximately $0.2 million in each of the years 2003,
2002 and 2001.

19. Related Parties

Certain
directors and senior employees have loan balances outstanding with the Company
at December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001. These loans have primarily been
granted by the Company for the purpose of assisting employee relocations, and
typically include terms more favorable than those prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions with other borrowers. Additionally, as of December 31,
2003, there were no EHOP loans outstanding to Executive Officers of the
Company, who are deemed to be subject to the requirements of Section 16 of
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. For further information on EHOP loans,
see “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note
18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Employee Benefit Plans.”

Additionally, certain borrowings
described under “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements—Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt” are due to the selling
partners of Alliant, who became employees of the Company.

20. Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements, Guarantees, and Other Commitments

In the normal course of business,
the Company uses financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to
meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include
commitments to extend credit, commercial and standby letters of credit, foreign
exchange options, and foreign exchange forward contracts. These instruments
involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. Credit risk is defined as


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

20. Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees, and Other Commitments

(Continued)

the possibility
of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to
perform in accordance with the terms of the contract.

Commitments to Extend
Credit

A commitment to extend credit is
a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no violation of
any condition established in the agreement. Such commitments generally have
fixed expiration dates, or other termination clauses, and usually require a fee
paid by the client upon the Company issuing the commitment. Commitments which
are available for funding, due to clients meeting all collateral, compliance
and financial covenants required under loan commitment agreements, totaled $1.7
billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Out of these available commitments balances, the fixed rate commitments were
$167.9 million and $133.1 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The Company’s exposure arising from interest rate risk associated
with fixed rate loan commitments is not considered material. Commitments which
are unavailable for funding, due to clients not meeting all collateral,
compliance and financial covenants required under loan commitment agreements,
totaled $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The Company’s potential exposure to credit loss, in the event of
nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument, is the
contractual amount of the available unused loan commitment. The Company uses
the same credit approval and monitoring process in extending loan commitments
as it does in making loans. The actual liquidity needs or the credit risk that
the Company has experienced have historically been lower than the contractual
amount of commitments to extend credit because a significant portion of these
commitments expire without being drawn upon. The Company evaluates each
potential borrower and the necessary collateral on an individual basis. The
type of collateral varies, but may include real property, bank deposits or
business and personal assets. The potential credit risk associated with these
commitments is considered in management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses.

Commercial and Standby
Letters of Credits

Commercial and standby letters of credit represent
conditional commitments issued by the Company on behalf of a client to
guarantee the performance of the client to a third party when certain specified
future events have occurred. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily
for inventory purchases by client and are typically short-term in nature.
The Company provides two types of standby letter of credit, performance and
financial standby letter of credits. Financial standby letters of credit are
conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the payment by a
client to a third party (beneficiary). Financial standby letters of credit are
primarily used to support many types of domestic and international payments. Performance
standby letters of credit are issued to guarantee the performance of a client
to a third party when certain specified future events have occurred. Performance
standby letters of credit are primarily used to support performance instruments
such as bid bonds, performance bonds, lease obligations, repayment of loans,
and past due notices. These standby letters of credit have fixed expiration
dates and generally require a fee paid by a client at the time the Company
issues the commitment. Fees generated from these standby letters of credit are
recognized in noninterest income over the commitment period.

The credit risk involved
in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with
extending loan commitments to clients, and accordingly, the Company uses a
credit evaluation process and collateral requirements similar to those for loan
commitments. The Company’s standby letters of credit often are cash-secured by
its clients. The actual liquidity needs or the credit risk that the Company has
experienced historically have been lower than the contractual amount of letters
of credit issued because a significant portion of these conditional commitments
expire without being drawn upon.

letters of credit was approximately $4.9 million. At December 31, 2003,
cash collateral available to the Company to reimburse losses under financial
and performance standby letters of credits was $265.0 million.

Foreign Exchange Forward
Contracts

The Company enters into foreign
exchange forward contracts with clients involved in international trade finance
activities, either as the purchaser or seller of foreign currency at a future
date, depending upon the clients’ need. The Company enters into an opposite way
foreign exchange forward contract with a correspondent bank, which completely
mitigates the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for each
of the foreign exchange forward contracts entered into with its clients. These
contracts are short-term in nature, typically expiring in less than 90
days. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the notional amounts of these
contracts totaled $95.4 million and $310.8 million, respectively. The maximum
credit exposure for counter-party nonperformance for foreign exchange
forward contracts with both clients and correspondent banks amounted to $2.5
million at December 31, 2003 and $7.4 million at December 31, 2002.
The Company has not experienced nonperformance by a counter-party and
therefore has not incurred related losses. 
Further, the Company anticipates performance by all counter-parties
to such foreign exchange forward contracts.

Foreign Currency Option
Contracts

The Company enters into foreign
currency option contracts with clients involved in international trade finance
activities, either as the purchaser or seller of foreign currency options,
depending upon the clients’ need. The Company enters into an opposite way
foreign currency option contract with a correspondent bank, which completely
mitigates the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for each
of the currency option contracts entered into with its clients. These contracts
typically expire in less than one year. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
notional amounts of these contracts totaled $21.1million and $49.5 million,
respectively. At December 31, 2003, and 2002, the Company did not have any
credit exposure for counter-party nonperformance for currency option
contracts with both clients and correspondent banks. The Company has not
experienced nonperformance by a counter-party and therefore has not
incurred related losses. Further, the Company anticipates performance by all
counter-parties.

Commitments to Invest in
Venture Capital Funds

In the merchant banking business,
the Company makes commitments to venture capital fund investments, which in
turn make investments in privately held companies. Commitments to invest in
these funds are generally made up to a ten-year period from the inception
of the venture capital fund. The timing of future cash requirements to fund
such commitments is generally dependent upon the venture capital investment
cycle, the overall market conditions, and the nature and type of industry in
which the privately-held companies operate. As of December 31, 2003, the
Company had remaining unfunded commitments of $31.7 million to wholly-owned
venture capital fund investments and $55.7 million to venture capital fund
investments through the fund of funds, SVB Strategic Investors Fund, L.P. The
Company has committed capital of $13.5 million to SVB Strategic Investors Fund,
L.P., representing an ownership interest of 11.1%. As of December 31,
2003, the remaining unfunded commitment to the fund was $8.1 million. In
addition, the Company made a capital commitment of $6.0 million to our venture
capital fund, Silicon Valley BancVentures, L.P. in which the Company has an
ownership interest of 10.7%. The remaining unfunded commitment to the fund was
$3.5 million as of December 31, 2003.

21. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments,” requires that the Company disclose estimated fair
values for its financial instruments. Fair value estimates, methods and
assumptions, set forth below for the Company’s financial instruments, are made
solely to comply with the requirements of SFAS No. 107 and should be read
in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related
notes.

Fair values are based on estimates or calculations at
the transaction level using present value techniques in instances where quoted
market prices are not available. Because broadly traded markets do not exist
for many of the Company’s financial instruments, the fair value calculations
attempt to incorporate the effect of current market conditions at a specific
time. Fair valuations are management’s estimates of the values, and they are
often calculated based on current pricing policies, the economic and
competitive environment, the characteristics of the financial instruments,
expected losses, and other such factors. These calculations are subjective in
nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and do not
include tax ramifications; therefore, the results cannot be determined with
precision, substantiated by comparison to independent markets, and may not be
realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the instruments. There
may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the
underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future
cash flows, could significantly affect the results. For all of these reasons,
the aggregation of the fair value calculations presented herein does not
represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of
the Company.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

21. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments (Continued)

The following describes the methods and assumptions
used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

This category includes cash and
due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial
institutions, federal funds sold, and securities purchased under agreement to
resell. The cash equivalents are readily convertible to known amounts of cash
and present insignificant risk of changes in value due to maturity dates of 90
days or less. For these short-term financial instruments, the carrying
amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Investment Securities

For marketable investment
securities classified as available-for-sale, fair values are based
on quoted market prices provided by a known and reputable pricing service or
dealer quotes. The Company records its wholly-owned non-marketable
venture capital fund investments and other private equity investments on a cost
basis less any identified impairment. For the Company’s venture capital fund,
Silicon Valley BancVentures, L.P., and its fund of funds, SVB Strategic
Investors Fund, L.P., the Company records the non-marketable venture
capital fund investments and other private equity investments at fair value
using investment accounting rules. See “Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements—Significant Accounting Policies—Marketable Equity Securities.”

Loans

The fair value of fixed and
variable rate loans is estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using
discount rates that reflect the Company’s current pricing for loans and the
forward yield curve.

Deposits

The fair value of interest
bearing deposits is estimated by discounting the deposit balances using the
Company’s cost of borrowing funds in the market and the forward yield curve.
The Demand deposits are stated at face value. The deposit portfolio was
segregated by core and non-core deposits. In addition, the duration and
interest rate sensitivity of the individual deposit accounts was taken into
account in determining the fair value.

Short-term
Borrowings and Long-term Debt

The fair value of long-term debt
is estimated based on quoted market prices for the issues for which there is a
market. Otherwise, the fair value of short-term borrowings and long-term debt
is calculated by discounting the contractual cash flows using the forward yield
curve. The fair value of the Company’s convertible subordinated debt is
estimated taking into account the value of its associated convertible note
hedge agreement. The hedge agreement limits the Company’s exposure to potential
dilution from conversion of the notes.

Off-Balance Sheet
Financial Instruments

The fair value of unfunded
commitments to extend credit is estimated based on the average amount the
Company would receive or pay to execute a new agreement with identical terms,
considering current interest rates and taking into account the remaining terms
of the agreement and counterparties’ credit standing.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

21. Fair Value
of Financial Instruments (Continued)

Letters of
credit generally expire in 90 days or less, therefore their fair value was
estimated at $0 in 2003 and 2002 due to their short-term nature. Commitments to
extend credit and letters of credit typically result in loans with a market
interest rate when funded.

Limitations

The information presented herein is based on pertinent
information available to the Company as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect
the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively
revalued since the most recent year-end and the estimated fair values of
these financial instruments may have changed significantly since that point in
time.

The estimated
fair values of the Company’s financial instruments at December 31, 2003
and 2002 are presented below.

22. Legal Matters

Certain lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary
course of business have been filed or are pending against the Company and/or
the Bank. Based upon information available to the Company, its review of such
claims to date and consultation with its legal counsel, management believes the
liability relating to these actions, if any, will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s liquidity, consolidated financial position or results
of operations.

23. Regulatory Matters

The Bank is subject to certain restrictions on the
amount of dividends that it may declare without the prior approval of the
Federal Reserve Board and the California Department of Financial Institutions.
At December 31, 2003, approximately $2.8 million of the Bank’s retained
earnings were available for dividend declaration to the Company without prior
regulatory approval.


SILICON VALLEY BANCSHARES AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

23. Regulatory
Matters

(Continued)

The Company and the Bank are subject to capital adequacy
guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve Board. Failure to meet minimum capital
requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional
discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material
impact on the Company’s and/or the Bank’s financial condition and results of
operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for
prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital
guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s and the Bank’s
balance sheet items, as well as certain off-balance sheet items, as
calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s and the Bank’s
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments
by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.

Under these capital guidelines, the minimum total risk-based
capital ratio and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirements are
10.0% and 6.0%, respectively, of risk-weighted assets and certain off-balance
sheet items for a well capitalized depository institution.

The Federal Reserve Board has also established minimum
capital leverage ratio guidelines for state member banks. The ratio is
determined using Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets. The
guidelines require a minimum of 5.0% for a well-capitalized depository
institution.

The following
table presents the capital ratios for the Company and the bank, as compared to
the minimum regulatory capital requirements for an adequately capitalized
depository institution, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002:

24. Stockholders’
Rights Plan

On October 22, 1998, the
Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) approved and adopted a stockholders’
rights plan (the “Rights Plan”) to, among other things, protect the Company’s
stockholders from coercive takeover tactics. On November 6, 2003, the
Board approved and adopted Amendment No. 1 to the Rights Plan to
increase from 10% to 15% the minimum percentage of common shares that any
person shall beneficially own to qualify as an “Acquiring Person” for purposes
of triggering the stockholders’ rights under the Rights Plan. On January 29,
2004, the Board approved and adopted an amended and restated Rights Plan (the “Amended
and Restated Rights Plan”), which supercedes and replaces in entirety the
Rights Plan.

The following summary of the
Rights and the Amended and Restated Rights Plan is a general description only
and is subject to the detailed terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated
Rights Plan, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.20 to the Company’s
amended and restated registration statement on Form 8-A/A, filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2004 and incorporated
herein by reference. Each capitalized term used but not defined below has the
meaning ascribed to such term in the Amended and Restated Rights Plan.

Under the Amended and Restated
Rights Plan, each stockholder of record on November 9, 1998 received a
dividend of one right (a “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock of
the Company. The Rights are attached to, and presently only traded with, shares
of the Company’s common stock and are not currently exercisable. Except as
specified below, upon becoming exercisable, each Right will entitle the holder
to purchase from the Company 1/1000th of a share of the Company’s Series A
Participating Preferred Stock at a price of $100.00 per share.

The Rights will become
exercisable and begin to trade separately from shares of the Company’s common
stock upon the earlier of: (i) the tenth (10th) business day (or such later
date as may be determined by action of the Company’s board of directors)
following a public announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common
stock, or (ii) the close of business on the tenth (10th) business day (or
such later date as may be determined by action of the Company’s board of directors)
following the commencement of, or announcement of a tender offer or exchange
offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a
person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s
common stock.

Unless the Rights are earlier
redeemed, in the event that an a person or group becomes the beneficial owner
of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, then
each Right which has not theretofore been exercised (other than the Rights
beneficially owned by the acquiring person, which will thereafter be void) will
thereafter entitle the holder to receive, upon exercise, common shares having a
value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right.

Similarly, unless the Rights are
earlier redeemed, in the event that, after a person or group becomes the
beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s
common stock, (i) the Company is acquired in a merger or other business
combination transaction, or (ii) 50% or more of the Company’s consolidated
assets or earning power are sold (other than in transactions in the ordinary
course of business), then each Right which has not theretofore been exercised
(other than the Rights beneficially owned by the acquiring person, which will
thereafter be void) will thereafter entitle the holder to receive, upon
exercise, shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a value equal
to two times the exercise price of the Right. 
The Company’s board of directors has the option any time after a person
or group becomes a 15% holder of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common
stock to exchange all or part of the Rights (other than Rights held by the
acquiring person) for shares of common stock of the Company provided that the
Company does not make such an exchange after the person becomes the beneficial
owner of 50% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock.

24. Stockholders’ Rights Plan

(Continued)

At any time on or prior to the
close of business on the earlier of (i) the fifth day following a public
announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or
more of the outstanding common shares (or such later date as may be determined
by action of the Company’s board of directors and publicly announced by the
Company) and (ii) January 31, 2014, the Company may redeem the Rights
in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per Right, subject to adjustment.

25. Parent
Company Only Condensed Financial Information

The condensed balance sheets of
Silicon Valley Bancshares (parent company only) at December 31, 2003 and
2002, and the related condensed statements of income and condensed statements
of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 are
presented below. Certain reclassifications have been made to the parent company’s
2002 and 2001 financial information to conform to the 2003 presentations. Such
reclassifications had no effect on the results of operations or stockholders’
equity.

Condensed
Balance Sheets

(1)

Includes cash on deposit with third-party banks of $0
and $2.0 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(2)

Includes loans to related parties of $1.3
million and $5.3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(3)    At December 31, 2003, includes $150.0 million of zero-coupon,
convertible debt, $51.5 million of 7.0% Junior Subordinated Debentures net of
issuance costs, and approximately $8.8 million due to the former owners of
Alliant Partners. Contrary to prior practice, for periods ending after December 15,
2003, in accordance with the provision of FIN No. 46, the Company has not
consolidated a special purpose trust, which was formed for the purpose of
issuing 7.0% Trust Preferred Securities. Therefore, as of December 31,
2003, the Company’s Junior Subordinated Debentures of $51.5 million issued to
this special purpose trust were classified as long-term debt and are not
classified as “indebtedness to nonbank subsidiary.” The parent company
guarantees all of the obligations of this special purpose trust.

For periods ending prior to December 15, 2003, in accordance with
the accounting rules in effect at that time, the Company consolidated a
special purpose trust, SVB Capital I, formed for the purpose of issuing $40.0
million in 8.25% Trust Preferred Securities. Therefore, for periods ending
prior to December 15, 2003 the related 8.25% Junior Subordinated
Debentures were classified as “indebtedness to nonbank subsidiary.” On
December 1, 2003, the Company redeemed the $40.0 million of 8.25% Trust
Preferred Securities.

certain procedural requirements for stockholders to propose matters to be acted
on at an annual or special meeting. Changes to the rights plan included
removing certain limitations on the ability of the Company’s board of directors
