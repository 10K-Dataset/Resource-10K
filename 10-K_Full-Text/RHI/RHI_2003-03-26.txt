PART I

Item 1.    Business

Robert Half International Inc. is the world's largest specialized provider of temporary and permanent personnel in the fields of accounting and finance. Its
divisions include

Accountemps

® and

Robert Half

®

Finance & Accounting

, providers of temporary
and permanent personnel, respectively, in the fields of accounting and finance. The Company, utilizing its experience as a
specialized provider of temporary and permanent personnel, has expanded into additional specialty fields. In 1991, the Company formed

OfficeTeam

® to provide skilled temporary administrative and
office personnel. In 1994, the Company established

Robert Half®
Technology

(formerly called

RHI Consulting®

) to concentrate on providing temporary and contract information
technology professionals in positions ranging from PC support technician to chief information officer. In 1992, the Company acquired

The
Affiliates

®, which focuses on placing temporary and regular employees in paralegal, legal administrative and other legal support positions. In 1997, the Company
established

Robert Half® Management Resources

(formerly called

RHI Management
Resources®

) to provide senior level project professionals specializing in the accounting and finance fields.

The Creative
Group

® provides project staffing in the advertising, marketing and web design fields.

The
Company's business was originally founded in 1948. Prior to 1986, the Company was primarily a franchisor of

Accountemps

and

Robert Half

offices. Beginning
in 1986, the Company and its current management embarked on a strategy of acquiring franchised locations. Only one of the
franchises remains outstanding. The Company has also acquired other local or regional providers of specialized temporary service personnel. Since 1986, the Company has significantly expanded
operations at many of the acquired locations and has opened many new locations. The Company believes that direct ownership of offices allows it to better monitor and protect the image of its
tradenames, promotes a more consistent and higher level of quality and service throughout its network of offices and improves profitability by centralizing many of its administrative functions. The
Company's temporary and permanent staffing services business currently has more than 320 offices in 42 states and the District of Columbia and ten foreign countries and placed
approximately 180,000 employees on temporary assignment with clients in 2002.

In
2002, the Company hired more than 700 professionals who had been affiliated with the internal audit and business and technology risk consulting practice of Arthur Andersen LLP,
including more than 50 individuals who had been partners of Andersen. These professionals formed the base of the Company's new Protiviti Inc. subsidiary.

Protiviti

SM

has enabled the Company
to enter the market for independent internal audit and business and technology risk consulting
services, which market the Company believes offers synergies with its traditional lines of business.

Accountemps

The

Accountemps

temporary services division offers customers a reliable and economical means of dealing with
uneven or peak work loads for accounting, tax and finance personnel caused by such predictable events as vacations, taking inventories, tax work, month-end activities and special projects and such
unpredictable events as illness and emergencies. Businesses increasingly view the use of temporary employees as a means of controlling personnel costs and converting such costs from fixed to variable.
The cost and inconvenience to clients of hiring and firing permanent employees are eliminated by the use of

Accountemps

temporaries. The temporary
workers are employees of

Accountemps

and are paid by

Accountemps

only when working on customer
assignments. The customer pays a fixed rate only for hours worked.

Accountemps

clients may fill their permanent employment needs by using an

Accountemps

employee on a trial basis and, if so desired, "converting" the temporary position
to a permanent position. The client typically pays a one-time fee for such conversions.

OfficeTeam

The Company's

OfficeTeam

division, which commenced operations in 1991, places temporary and permanent office and
administrative personnel, ranging from word processors to office managers.

OfficeTeam

operates in much the same fashion as the

Accountemps

and

Robert Half

divisions.


Robert Half Finance & Accounting

The Company offers permanent placement services through its office network under the name

Robert Half Finance &
Accounting

. The Company's

Robert Half Finance & Accounting

division (formerly the

Robert
Half

division) specializes in placing accounting, financial, tax and banking personnel. Fees for successful permanent placements are paid only by the employer and are generally
a percentage of the new employee's annual compensation. No fee for permanent placement services is charged to employment candidates.

Robert Half Technology

The Company's

Robert Half Technology

division, which commenced operations in 1994, specializes in providing
information technology contract consultants and placing regular employees in areas ranging from multiple platform systems integration to end-user support, including specialists in programming,
networking, systems integration, database design and help desk support.

The Affiliates

Since 1992, the Company has been placing temporary and permanent employees in attorney, paralegal, legal administrative and legal secretarial positions through
its

The Affiliates

division. The legal profession's requirements (the need for confidentiality, accuracy and reliability, a strong drive toward
cost-effectiveness, and frequent peak workload periods) are similar to the demands of the clients of the

Accountemps

division.

Robert Half Management Resources

The Company's

Robert Half Management Resources

division, which commenced operations in 1997, specializes in
providing senior level project professionals in the accounting and finance fields, including chief financial officers, controllers, and senior financial analysts, for such tasks as financial systems
conversions, expansion into new markets, business process reengineering and post-merger financial consolidation.

The Creative Group

The Creative Group

division commenced operations in 1999 and serves clients in the areas of advertising, marketing
and web design and places project consultants in a variety of positions such as creative directors, graphics designers, web content developers, web designers, media buyers, and public relations
specialists.

Protiviti

Protiviti

provides independent internal audit and business and technology risk consulting services.

Protiviti

helps clients identify, measure, and manage operational and technology-related risks they face within their industries and throughout their
systems and processes.

Protiviti

offers a full spectrum of professional consulting services, technologies, and skills for business and technology risk
management and the continual transformation of internal audit functions.

Marketing and Recruiting

The Company markets its temporary and permanent staffing services to clients as well as employment candidates. Local marketing and recruiting are generally
conducted by each office or related group of offices. Local advertising directed to clients and employment candidates consists primarily of yellow pages advertisements, classified advertisements,
websites, trade shows and advertising on the Internet. Direct marketing through e-mail, regular mail and telephone solicitation also constitutes a significant portion of the Company's total
advertising. National advertising conducted by the Company consists primarily of radio, television, print advertisements in national newspapers, magazines and certain trade journals. The Company has
initiated programs to take advantage of the Internet as a resource for recruiting candidates and filling client orders. Recent Internet initiatives include forging traffic building alliances with
leading Internet career search sites. The Company plans to expand its use of the Internet in all aspects of sales and recruitment. Joint marketing arrangements have been entered into with Microsoft,
Peachtree Software and Intuit and typically provide for cooperative advertising, joint mailings and similar promotional activities. The Company also actively seeks endorsements and affiliations with
professional organizations in the


business management, office administration and professional secretarial fields. The Company also conducts public relations activities designed to enhance public recognition of the Company and its
services. Local employees are encouraged to be active in civic organizations and industry trade groups.

Protiviti

markets its risk consulting and internal audit services to a variety of clients in a range of industries. Industry and
competency teams conduct targeted marketing efforts, both locally and nationally, including print advertising and branded speaking events, with support from

Protiviti

management. National advertising
conducted by

Protiviti

consists primarily of print
advertisements in national newspapers, magazines and selected trade journals.

Protiviti

has initiated a national direct mail program to share
information with clients on current corporate governance issues. It conducts public relations activities, such as press releases and newsletters, designed to enhance recognition for the

Protiviti

brand,
establish its expertise in key issues surrounding its business and promote its services.

Protiviti

plans to expand both the services and value added content on the

Protiviti.com

website and
increase traffic through targeted Internet advertising. Local employees are encouraged to be active in civic organizations and industry trade groups.

The
Company and its subsidiaries own many trademarks, service marks and tradenames, including the

marks, which are registered in the United States and in a number of foreign countries.

Organization

Management of the Company's temporary and permanent staffing operations is coordinated from its headquarters facilities in Menlo Park and Pleasanton, California.
The Company's headquarters provides support and centralized services to its offices in the administrative, marketing, accounting, training and legal areas, particularly as it relates to the
standardization of the operating procedures of its offices. The Company conducts its temporary and permanent staffing services operations through more than 320 offices in 42 states and the
District of Columbia and ten foreign countries. Office managers are responsible for most activities of their offices, including sales, local advertising and marketing and recruitment.

The
day-to-day operations of

Protiviti

are managed by a committee consisting of key operating personnel, with operational and
administrative support provided by individuals located in Pleasanton and Menlo Park, California.

Protiviti

has more than 30 offices in 20 states, the
District of Columbia and four foreign countries.

Competition

The Company's temporary and permanent staffing services face competition in attracting clients as well as high-quality specialized employment candidates. The
temporary and permanent placement businesses are highly competitive, with a number of firms offering services similar to those provided by the Company on a national, regional or local basis. In many
areas the local companies are the strongest competitors. The most significant competitive factors in the temporary and permanent placement businesses are price and the reliability of service, both of
which are often a function of the availability and quality of personnel. The Company believes it derives a competitive advantage from its long experience with and commitment to the specialized
employment market, its national presence, and its various marketing activities.

Protiviti

faces competition in its efforts to attract clients and win proposal presentations. The risk consulting and internal audit
businesses are highly competitive due to many new firms entering the market and the evolution of established firms in the business space. In addition, the changing regulatory environment is increasing
opportunities for non-attestation audit and risk consulting services. The principal competitors of

Protiviti

remain the "big four" accounting firms.
Significant competitive factors include reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel.

Protiviti

believes its competitive strengths lie in its
unique ability to couple the deep skills and proven methodologies of its "big four" heritage
with the customer focus and attention of a smaller organization.

Employees

The Company has approximately 6,900 full-time staff employees, including approximately 700 engaged directly in

Protiviti

operations.
The Company placed approximately 180,000 employees on


temporary assignments with clients during 2002. Temporary employees placed by the Company are the Company's employees for all purposes while they are working on assignments. The Company pays the
related costs of employment, such as workers' compensation insurance, state and federal unemployment taxes, social security and certain fringe benefits. The Company provides voluntary health insurance
coverage to interested temporary employees.

Other Information

The Company's current business constitutes three business segments. (See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for financial information about the Company's segments.)

The
Company is not dependent upon a single customer or a limited number of customers. The Company's temporary and permanent staffing services operations are generally more active in the
first and fourth quarters of a calendar year.

Protiviti

has been in operation only since May 2002, so there does not exist sufficient information
to determine to what extent, if any, its business may be seasonal. Order backlog is not a material aspect of the Company's temporary and permanent staffing services business. While backlog is of
greater importance to

Protiviti

, the Company does not believe, based upon the length of time of the average

Protiviti

engagement, that backlog is a
material aspect of the

Protiviti

business. No material portion
of the Company's business is subject to government contracts.

Information
about foreign operations is contained in Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Company does not have export sales.

Available Information

The Company's Internet address is

www.rhi.com

. Beginning with this report, the Company makes available, free of
charge, through its website, its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and its Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any
amendments to those reports, as soon as is reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Risk Factors

The Company's business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most important of these risks and uncertainties are
as follows:

Business Highly Dependent Upon the State of the Economy.

The demand for the Company's services, in particular its temporary
and permanent staffing services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company's clients. Any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels
of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific industry may severely reduce
the demand for the Company's services and thereby significantly decrease the Company's revenues and profits.

Availability of Candidates.

The Company's temporary and permanent staffing services business consists of the placement of
individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that qualified candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Qualified candidates generally seek temporary
or permanent positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Any shortage of qualified candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.

Highly Competitive Business.

The temporary and permanent staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is
a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In
addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company's revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain clients or market
share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.

Potential Liability to Employees and Clients.

The Company's temporary services business entails employing individuals on a
temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients' workplaces. The Company's ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the
Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination or harassment. While such claims have


not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon
the Company. The Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees. The Company maintains insurance with
respect to many of such claims. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain
insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside
the scope of the Company's insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.

Dependence Upon Personnel.

The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly
dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company
will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success.

Government Regulation.

The Company's business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign
countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses
or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect
the Company.

Government Regulation of the Workplace.

The Company's temporary services business entails employing individuals on a
temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients' workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship could materially adversely affect the
Company.

Reliance on Short-Term Contracts.

Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the
Company's temporary and permanent staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results.

Protiviti Recently Established.

Protiviti

was established in May 2002.
While its professionals have many years of experience in other organizations, there can be no assurance that they will be able to operate successfully in the

Protiviti

environment.

Impact of Protiviti on Corporate Management and Costs.

Integrating the recently hired professionals into

Protiviti

and establishing an infrastructure and procedures for

Protiviti

has caused the Company to
incur significant costs and the diversion of significant amounts of management time. Such costs and
expenditures of time can be expected to adversely impact the operations of the Company as a whole. There can be no assurance if, or when, such costs and diversion of time will decrease.

Protiviti Operating Losses.

Protiviti

has only recently begun operations. It
has not yet generated an operating profit, and there can be no assurance that the business will become profitable in the future.

Protiviti Dependence on Personnel.

Protiviti is a services business, and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain
personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so.

Protiviti Competition.

Protiviti

operates in a highly competitive business.
As with the Company's temporary and permanent staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than

Protiviti

and many of
which have been in operation far longer than

Protiviti

. In particular,

Protiviti

faces competition from the "big four" accounting firms, which have been in
operation for a considerable period of time and have established
reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of
personnel, there can be no assurance that

Protiviti

will be successful in attracting and retaining clients.

Protiviti Capitalization.

The Company incurred certain capitalizable costs in connection with the establishment of

Protiviti

. Because there can be no assurance that Protiviti will ultimately be successful, or, if so, that it will attain any specified level of
success, some or all of the capitalizable costs incurred in connection with the establishment of Protiviti may ultimately become impaired and, therefore, written off.


Potential Liability.

The business of

Protiviti

consists of providing internal
audit and business and technology risk consulting services. Liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the Company or

Protiviti

for claims related to these activities or to
prior transactions or activities. Because

Protiviti

has been in operation for less than one year, the Company cannot estimate the extent to which such liability or litigation may occur. There
can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on

Protiviti

or the Company.

Item 2.    Properties

The Company's headquarters operations are located in Menlo Park and Pleasanton, California. Placement activities are conducted through more than
320 offices located in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.

Protiviti

has more than 30
offices in the United States, France, Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom. All of the offices are leased.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

The Company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings other than routine litigation incidental to its business.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matter was submitted to a vote of the Company's security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.


PART II

Item 5.    Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Certain information contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed forward-looking statements regarding events
and financial trends that may affect the Company's future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as "estimate", "forecast", "project", "plan",
"intend", "believe", "expect", "anticipate", or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in levels of unemployment
and other economic conditions in the U.S. or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of qualified candidates for temporary
employment or the Company's ability to attract qualified candidates; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to maintain
existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the
Company's services, on the Company's ability to maintain its profit margins; the
possibility of the Company incurring liability for its activities, including the activities of its temporary employees or for events impacting its temporary employees on clients' premises; the success
of the Company in attracting, training and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; whether governments will impose additional regulations or licensing requirements on
personnel services businesses in particular or on employer/employee relationships in general; future success of the new Protiviti subsidiary will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract
clients; significant costs and diversion of management time could be incurred in integrating key personnel into Protiviti; certain capitalizable costs associated with the Protiviti employment
arrangements could become impaired and written off; failure of Protiviti to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and the possibility of involvement in litigation
relating to prior transactions or activities. Further information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in Item 1. Business under the heading "Risk Factors". Because
long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company's business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results.

Critical Accounting Policies

In response to the SEC's Release No. 33-8040, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies," we identified the
Company's most critical accounting policies to be those that involve subjective decisions, assessments or estimates.

Accounts Receivable Allowances.

The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments,
additional allowances may be required. Estimates used in determining the accounts receivable allowances were based on current trends and historical loss statistics. Actual results may differ from
these estimates, which may materially affect the Company's future financial results.

Income Tax Assets and Liabilities.

In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the Company makes
judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations. The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluates the
need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. The likelihood of a material change in the Company's expected realization of these assets is dependent on future
taxable income, its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant
jurisdictions. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding deferred income tax assets and liabilities are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may
materially affect the future financial results of the Company.

Employee Retirement Plans.

The determination of the Company's obligations for certain employee retirement plans is dependent
upon various assumptions, including, among others, interest rates, service periods, and future compensation levels. Management believes its assumptions are appropriate, however significant differences
in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Company's future financial results.


Goodwill Impairment.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"
("SFAS 142") the Company assesses the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may not be recoverable. This assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating
performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management. The Company's estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, economic conditions,
changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect the future financial results of the
Company. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the year ended December 31, 2002 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.

Workers' Compensation.

The Company has established reserves for workers' compensation claims based on historical loss
statistics. The Company self-insures or retains a portion of the exposure for losses related to workers' compensation. It is the Company's policy to record self-insurance reserves based upon claims
filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. While management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant
changes in assumptions may materially affect the Company's future financial results.

Stock Option Plans.

The Company has a long history of issuing stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of
its compensation programs. Generally accepted accounting principles allow alternative methods of accounting for these plans. The Company has chosen to account for its stock option plans under APB
Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). Under APB 25, the intrinsic value of the options is used to record compensation expense and, as a result, no compensation
expense related to stock options is included in determining net income and net income per share in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The alternative method of accounting for stock options is
prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123. Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements sets forth calculations of pro forma net income and net income per
share computed in accordance with this method.

Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2002

Temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were $1.8 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, decreasing by 22% and 8% during 2002 and 2001, respectively. Permanent placement revenues were $100 million, $189 million and $252 million for
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, decreasing by 47% and 25% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Staffing services revenue results for year ended December 31,
2002 were adversely impacted by weak labor markets and soft general economic conditions, particularly in the United States. Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were $42 million
for the period May 24, 2002 (inception) to December 31, 2002. We expect total company revenues to continue to be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2003.

The
Company's temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 320 offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and ten foreign countries, while Protiviti
has more than 30 offices in 21 states and four foreign countries. Revenues from domestic operations represented 83%, 85% and 89% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively. Revenues from foreign operations represented 17%, 15% and 11% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Gross
margin dollars from the Company's temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance
costs for temporary employees. Gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services are equal to revenues, as there are no direct costs associated with such revenues. Gross margin dollars
for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, insurance costs and reimbursable
expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Company's temporary and consultant staffing services were $628 million, $828 million and $908 million for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, decreasing by 24% and 9% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Gross margin amounts equaled 36% of revenues for temporary and consultant staffing
services for the year ended December 31, 2002, and 37% for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. The lower 2002 temporary and consulting margin percentage is primarily due to lower
temp-to-perm conversion fees, which carry higher margins. Gross margin dollars for


the Company's permanent placement staffing division were $100 million, $189 million and $252 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively,
decreasing by 47% and 25% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Gross margin dollars for the Company's risk consulting and internal audit division were negative $13 million for the period
May 24, 2002 (inception) to December 31, 2002, which reflects fixed payroll costs that were not totally covered by revenues.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $710 million in 2002, compared to $823 million in 2001 and $864 million in 2000. Selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 37%, 34% and 32% for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses
consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. The percentage increase in 2002 was primarily due to negative leverage from fixed operating expenses including
depreciation, occupancy costs and administrative compensation.

For
acquisitions, the Company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets, if any, and then to goodwill.
The Company adopted SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, resulting in the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill that was being amortized over 40 years. The methods used for
evaluating and measuring impairment of certain intangible assets have changed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the
year ended December 31, 2002 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. Net intangible assets represented 17% of total assets and 22% of total
stockholders' equity at December 31, 2002.

Interest
income for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $5.5 million, $9.3 million and $11.3 million, respectively, while interest expense
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $.9 million, $.8 million and $.9 million, respectively. Higher average cash balances in 2002 were more than offset
by lower interest rates during the year, yielding lower interest income.

The
provision for income taxes was 38% of income before taxes for each of the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The change in the Company's liquidity during the past three years is the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for capital expenditures,
the purchase of intangible assets, repurchases of common stock, and principal payments on outstanding notes payable. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has authorized the repurchase, from
time to time, of up to 11.1 million additional shares of the Company's common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. During the year
ended December 31, 2002, the Company repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares of common stock on the open market for a total cost of $132 million. Additional stock repurchases
were made in connection with employee stock plans, whereby Company shares were tendered by employees for the payment of applicable withholding taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2002,
such repurchases totaled approximately 0.6 million shares at a cost of $15 million. Repurchases of securities have been funded with cash generated from operations. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Company generated $166 million from operations, used $89 million in investing activities and used $107 million in financing activities. This is
further enumerated in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The
Company's working capital at December 31, 2002, included $317 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company's working capital requirements consist primarily of the
financing of accounts receivable. While there can be no assurances in this regard, the Company expects that internally generated cash will be sufficient to support the working capital needs of the
Company, the Company's fixed payments, and other obligations on both a short- and long-term basis. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had no material capital commitments. In
connection with the formation of Protiviti, the Company became the guarantor of certain former Andersen partners' capital notes, which totaled approximately $4 million at December 31,
2002.

provides information technology professionals.

The Affiliates

provides temporary, project, and full-time
staffing of attorneys and specialized support personnel within law firms and corporate legal departments.

The Creative Group

provides project staffing
in the advertising, marketing, and web design fields.

Protiviti

began operations on May 24, 2002, and provides business and technology risk
consulting and internal audit services.

Protiviti

, which primarily employs risk consulting and internal audit professionals formerly associated with
major accounting firms, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Revenues are predominantly derived from specialized staffing services. The Company operates in the United States, Canada, Europe,
Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The Company is a Delaware corporation.

Basis of Presentation.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and
results of operations for the periods presented have been included.

Principles of Consolidation.

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries,
all of which are wholly-owned. All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. As of December 31, 2002, such estimates included reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable,
workers' compensation losses, legal claims, income and other taxes, and certain employee retirement plans.

Revenue Recognition.

Temporary and consultant staffing services revenues are recognized when the services are rendered by the
Company's temporary employees. Permanent placement staffing revenues are recognized when employment candidates accept offers of permanent employment. Allowances are established to estimate losses due
to placed candidates not remaining employed for the Company's guarantee period, typically 90 days. Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues are recognized as services are provided.
Reimbursements, including those relating to travel and out-of-pocket expenses, are included in revenues, and equivalent amounts of reimbursable expenses are included in direct
costs of services.

Costs of Services.

Direct costs of staffing services consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance costs for the Company's
temporary employees. There are no direct costs associated with permanent placement staffing services. Risk consulting and internal audit costs of services include professional staff payroll, payroll
taxes and insurance costs, as well as reimbursable expenses.

Advertising Costs.

The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity at the date of purchase of
three months or less as cash equivalents.

Intangible Assets.

Intangible assets primarily consist of the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair market value
of their net tangible assets at the date of acquisition, which were being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 40 years through December 31, 2001. The Company
adopted SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, under which goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life. The methods used for evaluating and measuring impairment of
certain intangible assets have changed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. The Company completed its annual goodwill


impairment test during the year ended December 31, 2002, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.

Income Tax Assets and Liabilities.

In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the Company makes
judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations. The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluates the
need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. The likelihood of a material change in the Company's expected realization of these assets is dependent on future
taxable income, its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant
jurisdictions.

Foreign Currency Translation.

The results of operations of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated at the monthly
average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The financial position of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is translated at the current exchange rates at the end of the period, and the related
translation adjustments are recorded as a component of comprehensive income within Stockholders' Equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the Consolidated
Statements of Income, and have not been material for all periods presented.

Stock Option Plans.

The Company accounts for its stock option plans in accordance with APB 25. Under APB 25, the intrinsic
value of the options is used to record compensation expense and, as a result, no compensation expense related to stock options is included in determining net income and net income per share in the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements sets forth calculations of pro forma net income and net income per share computed in accordance with the
method prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is computed using the
straight-line method over the following useful lives:

Computer hardware

3 years

Computer software

2 to 5 years

Furniture and equipment

5 years

Leasehold improvements

Term of lease, 5 years maximum

Internal-use Software.

The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of
internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are reported as a component of computer software within property and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company
capitalized approximately $15.6 million of internal-use software development costs.

Note B—New Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), "Guarantor's Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor's balance sheet upon issuance of a
guarantee. In addition, FIN 45 requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective
basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantor's fiscal year-end. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial
statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company believes that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on its financial statements.

In
December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 ("SFAS 148"), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure."
SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 148 also requires that
disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally,
SFAS 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 are effective


for fiscal years ended after December 15, 2002. The interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company believes that the
adoption of this standard will have no material impact on its financial statements.

Note C—Deferred Income Taxes and Other Current Assets

As of December 31, 2002, deferred income taxes and other current assets consisted primarily of $28.9 million of deferred income taxes,
$29.7 million of amounts on deposit in irrevocable grantor trusts related to employee benefit and retirement plans, and $24.1 million of income taxes receivable.

The
Company adopted SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, resulting in the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill that was being amortized over 40 years. Under
SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life. Had goodwill not been amortized in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company's pro
forma net income and net income per share would have been as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

The
Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the year ended December 31, 2002, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was
required. The Company will perform annual assessments for impairment, applying a discounted cash flow-based test to its reportable units, which are its various lines of business.


On
May 23, 2002, the Company completed its arrangement to hire professionals formerly associated with a major accounting firm's U.S. risk consulting and internal audit practices.
These professionals comprise the talent base of Protiviti Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which provides business and technology risk consulting and internal audit services. The
Company paid $16.1 million, including transaction costs, to secure the release of Protiviti employees from their covenants not to compete or solicit. Subsequently, the Company made additional
risk consulting business acquisitions of $3.1 million and recorded intangible assets of $2.6 million as a result. Substantially all of these intangible assets are being amortized over
18 months and will become fully amortized in 2003, resulting in estimated 2003 amortization expense of $10.0 million.

The
Company is involved in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. While management does not expect any of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, litigation is subject to certain inherent uncertainties.

In
connection with the formation of Protiviti, the Company became the guarantor of certain employee notes totaling $4 million at December 31, 2002.

Note J—Stockholders' Equity

Stock Repurchase Program.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase,
from time to time, of up to 11.1 million additional shares of the Company's common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. During the
year ended December 31, 2002, the Company repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares on the open market for a total cost of $132 million. Since the inception of the repurchase
program in 1997, the Company has repurchased approximately 26.9 million shares of common stock on the open market pursuant to this program. Additional stock repurchases were made in connection
with employee stock plans, whereby Company shares were tendered by employees for the payment of applicable withholding taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2002, such repurchases totaled
approximately 0.6 million shares at a cost of $15 million.

Note K—Stock Plans

Under various stock plans, officers, employees and outside directors may receive grants of restricted stock or options to purchase common stock. Grants are made
at the discretion of the Stock Plan Committee of the Board of Directors. Grants generally vest between two and four years.

Options
granted under the plans have exercise prices ranging from 85% to 100% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant and may consist of both
incentive stock options and nonstatutory stock options under the Internal Revenue Code. The terms range from 27 months to 10 years.

Recipients
of restricted stock do not pay any cash consideration to the Company for the shares, have the right to vote all shares subject to such grant, and receive all dividends with
respect to such shares, whether or not the shares have vested. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Vesting is accelerated upon the death or disability
of the recipients.

The
Company accounts for these plans under APB 25. Therefore, the intrinsic value of the options is used to record compensation expense and, as a result, no compensation expense
has been recognized for its stock option plans. Had compensation expense for the stock options granted subsequent to January 1, 1995, been based on the estimated fair value at the award dates,
as prescribed by Statement of Financial


Accounting Standards No. 123, the Company's pro forma net income and net income per share would have been as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

The
pro forma amounts do not include amounts for stock options granted before January 1, 1995. Therefore, the pro forma amounts may not be representative of the disclosed effects
on pro forma net income and net income per share for future years.

The
fair value of each option is estimated, as of the grant date, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000: no
dividend yield for any year; expected volatility of 48% to 60%; risk-free interest rates of 2.3% to 6.8%; and expected lives of 1.5 to 5.8 years.

The
weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2002 excludes the dilutive effect of approximately 5.2 million options, since such
options have an exercise price in excess of the 2002 average market value of the Company's common stock. Had such options been included, the dilutive effect would have been calculated using the
treasury method.

Note M—Business Segments

The Company has three reportable segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing, and risk consulting services. The temporary and
consultant segment provides specialized staffing in the accounting and finance, administrative and office, information technology, legal, advertising, marketing and web design fields. The permanent
placement segment provides full-time personnel in the accounting, finance, administrative and office, and information technology fields. The risk consulting segment provides business and
technology risk consulting and internal audit services.

The
accounting policies of the segments are set forth in Note A—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The Company evaluates performance based on profit or loss
from operations before interest income, intangible amortization expense, and income taxes.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Robert Half International Inc.:

In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002 and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Robert Half International Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. The financial statements of the Company as of
December 31, 2001, and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2001, were audited by other independent accountants who have ceased operations. Those independent
accountants expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements in their report dated January 18, 2002.

As
further described in Note D to the financial statements, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," became effective
for calendar year filing companies on January 1, 2002. As a result, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill as of January 1, 2002 and as required by SFAS 142, amended its footnote
disclosure to provide comparative pro-forma information for the two years ended December 31, 2001. As discussed above, the financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2001,
and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2001, were audited by other independent accountants who have ceased operations. We audited the pro forma disclosures described in
Note D. In our opinion, the pro forma disclosures for 2001 and 2000 in Note D are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 or 2000
financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 or 2000 financial statements
taken as a whole.

This is a copy of the audit report previously issued by Arthur Andersen LLP in connection with Robert Half International Inc.'s filing on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2001. This audit report has not been reissued by Arthur Andersen LLP in connection with this filing on Form 10-K. See Exhibit 23.2 for further discussion. This audit report
was issued before our adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors

of Robert Half International Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Robert Half International Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001
and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Robert Half International Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

San
Francisco, California

January 18, 2002


Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Prior to April 24, 2002, Arthur Andersen LLP served as the Company's independent accountants. On April 24, 2002, the Company reached a
tentative agreement with Andersen to hire partners and other employees within Andersen's U.S. internal audit and business risk consulting practices. Andersen and the Company's Board of Directors and
Audit Committee determined that execution of the agreement would cause Andersen to no longer be independent. The Company's auditing relationship with Andersen was therefore severed by mutual agreement
effective April 24, 2002.

During
the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, and the subsequent interim periods through the termination of the relationship with Andersen,
there was no disagreement between Andersen and the Company, as defined in Item 304 of Regulation S-K, on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused Andersen to make reference to the subject matter of such disagreement in
connection with its reports, and there occurred no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

The
audit reports of Andersen on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 did not contain an
adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

The
Company provided Andersen with a copy of the foregoing statements. Exhibit 16 is a copy of Andersen's letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission dated April 26,
2002, stating its agreement with such statements.

On
July 16, 2002, the Company engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as its independent accountant. From January 1, 2000, through such date, neither the Company nor anyone
acting on its behalf consulted PricewaterhouseCoopers regarding either (a) the application of accounting principles to any specified transaction, either completed or proposed, (b) the
type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements or (c) any disagreement or reportable event described in Section 304(a) of
Regulation S-K.

PART III

The information required by Items 10 through 13 of Part III is incorporated by reference from Item 5 of this Report and from the registrant's Proxy
Statement, under the captions

"Nomination and Election of Directors," "Beneficial Stock Ownership," "Compensation of Directors," "Compensation of Executive Officers" and
"Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation and Certain Transactions,"

which Proxy Statement will be mailed to stockholders in connection with the registrant's
annual meeting of stockholders which is scheduled to be held in May 2003.

Item 14. Controls and Procedures

During the 90-day period prior to the filing date of this report, management, including the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice
Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon, and as of the date of that evaluation,
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required.

There
have been no significant changes in the Company's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date that the Company
carried out its evaluation.
