PART I

Item 1.    Business

Robert Half International Inc. (the "Company") provides specialized staffing and risk consulting services through such divisions as

Accountemps®, Robert
Half® Finance & Accounting, OfficeTeam®, Robert Half® Technology, Robert Half® Management
Resources, Robert Half® Legal, The Creative Group®,

and

Protiviti®

. The Company, through its

Accountemps, Robert Half Finance &
Accounting

, and

Robert Half Management Resources

divisions, is the
world's largest specialized provider of temporary, full-time, and project professionals in the fields of accounting and finance.

OfficeTeam

specializes
in highly skilled temporary administrative support personnel.

Robert Half Technology

provides information technology professionals.

Robert Half Legal

(formerly

The Affiliates

®) provides temporary, project, and full-time
staffing of attorneys and specialized support personnel within law firms and corporate legal departments.

The Creative Group

provides project staffing
in the advertising, marketing, and web design fields.

Protiviti

began operations on May 2002 and provides business and technology risk consulting and
internal audit services.

Protiviti

, which primarily employs risk consulting and internal audit professionals formerly associated with major accounting
firms, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

The
Company's business was originally founded in 1948. Prior to 1986, the Company was primarily a franchisor, under the names

Accountemps

and

Robert Half

(now called

Robert Half Finance & Accounting

), of offices providing temporary and
full-time professionals in the fields of accounting and finance. Beginning in 1986, the Company and its current management embarked on a strategy of acquiring franchised locations. All of the
franchises have been acquired. The Company believes that direct ownership of offices allows it to better monitor and protect the image of its tradenames, promotes a more consistent and higher level of
quality and service throughout its network of offices and improves profitability by centralizing many of its administrative functions. Since 1986, the Company has significantly expanded operations at
many of the acquired locations, opened many new locations and acquired other local or regional providers of specialized temporary service personnel. The Company has also expanded the scope of its
services by launching the new product lines

OfficeTeam

,

Robert Half Technology

,

Robert Half Management Resources

,

Robert Half Legal

and

The Creative
Group

.

In
2002, the Company hired more than 700 professionals who had been affiliated with the internal audit and business and technology risk consulting practice of Arthur Andersen LLP,
including more than 50 individuals who had been partners of Andersen. These professionals formed the base of the Company's new Protiviti Inc. subsidiary.

Protiviti

® has enabled the Company to enter
the market for independent internal audit and business and technology risk consulting services,
which market the Company believes offers synergies with its traditional lines of business.

Accountemps

The

Accountemps

temporary services division offers customers a reliable and economical means of dealing with
uneven or peak work loads for accounting, tax and finance personnel caused by such predictable events as vacations, taking inventories, tax work, month-end activities and special projects and such
unpredictable events as illness and emergencies. Businesses increasingly view the use of temporary employees as a means of controlling personnel costs and converting such costs from fixed to variable.
The cost and inconvenience to clients of hiring and firing permanent employees are eliminated by the use of

Accountemps

temporaries. The temporary
workers are employees of

Accountemps

and are paid by

Accountemps

only when working on customer
assignments. The customer pays a fixed rate only for hours worked.

Accountemps

clients may fill their permanent employment needs by using an

Accountemps

employee on a trial basis and, if so desired, "converting" the temporary position
to a permanent position. The client typically pays a one-time fee for such conversions.


OfficeTeam

The Company's

OfficeTeam

division, which commenced operations in 1991, places temporary and permanent office and
administrative personnel, ranging from word processors to office managers.

OfficeTeam

operates in much the same fashion as the

Accountemps

and

Robert Half

divisions.

Robert Half Finance & Accounting

The Company's

Robert Half Finance & Accounting

division specializes in the permanent placement of accounting,
financial, tax and banking personnel. Fees for successful permanent placements are paid only by the employer and are generally a percentage of the new employee's annual compensation. No fee for
permanent placement services is charged to employment candidates.

Robert Half Technology

The Company's

Robert Half Technology

division, which commenced operations in 1994, specializes in providing
information technology contract consultants and placing regular employees in areas ranging from multiple platform systems integration to end-user support, including specialists in programming,
networking, systems integration, database design and help desk support.

Robert Half Legal

Since 1992, the Company has been placing temporary and permanent employees in attorney, paralegal, legal administrative and legal secretarial positions through
its

Robert Half Legal

division (formerly called

The Affiliates

). The legal profession's requirements
(the need for confidentiality, accuracy and reliability, a strong drive toward cost-effectiveness, and frequent peak workload periods) are similar to the demands of the clients of the

Accountemps

division.

Robert Half Management Resources

The Company's

Robert Half Management Resources

division, which commenced operations in 1997, specializes in
providing senior level project professionals in the accounting and finance fields, including chief financial officers, controllers, and senior financial analysts, for such tasks as financial systems
conversions, expansion into new markets, business process reengineering and post-merger financial consolidation.

The Creative Group

The Creative Group

division commenced operations in 1999 and serves clients in the areas of advertising, marketing
and web design and places project consultants in a variety of positions such as creative directors, graphics designers, web content developers, web designers, media buyers, and public relations
specialists.

Protiviti

Protiviti

provides independent internal audit and business and technology risk consulting services.

Protiviti

helps clients identify, measure, and manage operational and technology-related risks they face within their industries and throughout their
systems and processes.

Protiviti

offers a full spectrum of professional consulting services, technologies, and skills for business and technology risk
management and the continual transformation of internal audit functions.

Marketing and Recruiting

The Company markets its temporary and permanent staffing services to clients as well as employment candidates. Local marketing and recruiting are generally
conducted by each office or related group of


offices.
Local advertising directed to clients and employment candidates consists primarily of yellow pages advertisements, classified advertisements, websites, trade shows and advertising on the
Internet. Direct marketing through e-mail, regular mail and telephone solicitation also constitutes a significant portion of the Company's total advertising. National advertising conducted by the
Company consists primarily of radio, print advertisements in national newspapers, magazines and certain trade journals. The Company has initiated programs to take advantage of the Internet as a
resource for recruiting candidates and filling client orders. Recent Internet initiatives include forging traffic building alliances with leading Internet career search sites. The Company plans to
expand its use of the Internet in all aspects of sales and recruitment. Joint marketing arrangements have been entered into with major software manufacturers and typically provide for development of
proprietary skills tests, cooperative advertising, joint mailings and similar promotional activities. The Company also actively seeks endorsements and affiliations with professional organizations in
the business management, office administration and professional secretarial fields. The Company also conducts public relations activities designed to enhance public recognition of the Company and its
services. Local employees are encouraged to be active in civic organizations and industry trade groups.

Protiviti

markets its risk consulting and internal audit services to a variety of clients in a range of industries. Industry and
competency teams conduct targeted marketing efforts, both locally and nationally, including print advertising and branded speaking events, with support from

Protiviti

management. National advertising
conducted by

Protiviti

consists primarily of print
advertisements in national newspapers, magazines and selected trade journals.

Protiviti

has initiated a national direct mail program to share
information with clients on current corporate governance issues. It conducts public relations activities, such as press releases and newsletters, designed to enhance recognition for the

Protiviti

brand,
establish its expertise in key issues surrounding its business and promote its services.

Protiviti

plans to expand both the services and value added content on the

Protiviti.com

website and
increase traffic through targeted Internet advertising. Local employees are encouraged to be active in civic organizations and industry trade groups.

The
Company and its subsidiaries own many trademarks, service marks and tradenames, including the

Organization

Management of the Company's temporary and permanent staffing operations is coordinated from its headquarters facilities in Menlo Park and Pleasanton, California.
The Company's headquarters provides support and centralized services to its offices in the administrative, marketing, public relations, accounting, training and legal areas, particularly as it relates
to the standardization of the operating procedures of its offices. The Company conducts its temporary and permanent staffing services operations through more than 325 offices in 43 states, the
District of Columbia and ten foreign countries. Office managers are responsible for most activities of their offices, including sales, local advertising and marketing and recruitment.

The
day-to-day operations of

Protiviti

are managed by a committee consisting of key operating personnel, with operational and
administrative support provided by individuals located in Pleasanton and Menlo Park, California.

Protiviti

has more than 30 offices in 20 states and six
foreign countries.

Competition

The Company's temporary and permanent staffing services face competition in attracting clients as well as high-quality specialized employment candidates. The
temporary and permanent placement businesses are highly competitive, with a number of firms offering services similar to those provided by the Company on a national, regional or local basis. In many
areas the local companies are the strongest


competitors.
The most significant competitive factors in the temporary and permanent placement businesses are price and the reliability of service, both of which are often a function of the
availability and quality of personnel. The Company believes it derives a competitive advantage from its long experience with and commitment to the specialized employment market, its national presence,
and its various marketing activities.

Protiviti

faces competition in its efforts to attract clients and win proposal presentations. The risk consulting and internal audit
businesses are highly competitive due to many new firms entering the market and the evolution of established firms in the business space. In addition, the changing regulatory environment is increasing
opportunities for non-attestation audit and risk consulting services. The principal competitors of

Protiviti

remain the "big four" accounting firms.
Significant competitive factors include reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel.

Protiviti

believes its competitive strengths lie in its
unique ability to couple the deep skills and proven methodologies of its "big four" heritage
with the customer focus and attention of a smaller organization.

Employees

The Company has approximately 7,300 full-time staff employees, including approximately 850 engaged directly in

Protiviti

operations.
The Company placed approximately 175,000 employees on temporary assignments with clients during 2003. Temporary employees
placed by the Company are the Company's employees for all purposes while they are working on assignments. The Company pays the related costs of employment, such as workers' compensation insurance,
state and federal unemployment taxes, social security and certain fringe benefits. The Company provides access to voluntary health insurance coverage to interested temporary employees.

Other Information

The Company's current business constitutes three business segments. (See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for financial information about the Company's segments.)

The
Company is not dependent upon a single customer or a limited number of customers. The Company's temporary and permanent staffing services operations are generally more active in the
first and fourth quarters of a calendar year.

Protiviti

has been in operation only since May 2002, so there does not exist sufficient information
to determine to what extent, if any, its business may be seasonal. Order backlog is not a material aspect of the Company's temporary and permanent staffing services business. While backlog is of
greater importance to

Protiviti

, the Company does not believe, based upon the length of time of the average

Protiviti

engagement, that backlog is a
material aspect of the

Protiviti

business. No material portion
of the Company's business is subject to government contracts.

Information
about foreign operations is contained in Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Company does not have export sales.

Available Information

The Company's Internet address is

www.rhi.com

. The Company makes available, free of charge, through its website,
its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and its Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon
as is reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also available on the Company's website are its Corporate Governance Guidelines, its Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics, and the charters for its Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee, each of which is available in print to any stockholder who makes
a request to Robert Half International Inc., 2884 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, Attn: Corporate Secretary. The


Company's
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is the Code of Ethics required by Item 406 of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K. The Company intends to satisfy any
disclosure obligations under Item 10 of Form 8-K regarding any amendment or waiver relating to its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by posting such information on its website.

Risk Factors

The Company's business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most important of these risks and uncertainties are
as follows:

Business Highly Dependent Upon the State of the Economy.

The demand for the Company's services, in particular its temporary
and permanent staffing services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company's clients. Any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels
of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific industry may severely reduce
the demand for the Company's services and thereby significantly decrease the Company's revenues and profits.

Availability of Candidates.

The Company's temporary and permanent staffing services business consists of the placement of
individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that qualified candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Qualified candidates generally seek temporary
or permanent positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Any shortage of qualified candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.

Highly Competitive Business.

The temporary and permanent staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is
a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In
addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company's revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain clients or market
share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.

Potential Liability to Employees and Clients.

The Company's temporary services business entails employing individuals on a
temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients' workplaces. The Company's ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the
Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination or harassment. While such claims have not historically
had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the Company. The
Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees. The Company maintains insurance with respect to many of such
claims. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that
does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Company's
insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.

Dependence Upon Personnel.

The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly
dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company
will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success.


Government Regulation.

The Company's business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign
countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses
or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect
the Company.

Government Regulation of the Workplace.

The Company's temporary services business entails employing individuals on a
temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients' workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship could materially adversely affect the
Company.

Reliance on Short-Term Contracts.

Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the
Company's temporary and permanent staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results.

Impact of Protiviti on Corporate Management and Costs.

Integrating the recently hired professionals into

Protiviti

and establishing an infrastructure and procedures for

Protiviti

has caused the Company to
incur significant costs and the diversion of significant amounts of management time. Such costs and expenditures of time can be expected to adversely impact the operations of the Company as a whole.
There can be no assurance if, or when, such costs and diversion of time will decrease.

Protiviti Operating Losses.

Protiviti

has only recently begun operations. It
has not yet generated an operating profit, and there can be no assurance that the business will become profitable in the future.

Protiviti Dependence on Personnel.

Protiviti is a services business, and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain
personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so.

Protiviti Competition.

Protiviti

operates in a highly competitive business.
As with the Company's temporary and permanent staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than

Protiviti

and many of
which have been in operation far longer than

Protiviti

. In particular,

Protiviti

faces competition from the "big four" accounting firms, which have been in
operation for a considerable period of time and have established
reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of
personnel, there can be no assurance that

Protiviti

will be successful in attracting and retaining clients.

Demand for Services.

In 2002 and 2003, the operations of

Protiviti

included
services related to Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory compliance. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services.

Potential Liability.

The business of

Protiviti

consists of providing internal
audit and business and technology risk consulting services. Liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the Company or

Protiviti

for claims related to these activities or to
prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation
will not have a material adverse impact on

Protiviti

or the Company.

Item 2.    Properties

The Company's headquarters operations are located in Menlo Park and Pleasanton, California. Placement activities are conducted through more than
325 offices located in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Australia


and
New Zealand.

Protiviti

has more than 30 offices in the United States, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom. All of the
offices are leased.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

The Company is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings other than routine litigation incidental to its business.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matter was submitted to a vote of the Company's security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Certain information contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed forward-looking statements regarding events
and financial trends that may affect the Company's future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as "estimate", "forecast", "project", "plan",
"intend", "believe", "expect", "anticipate", or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in levels of unemployment
and other economic conditions in the United States or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of qualified candidates for
temporary employment or the Company's ability to attract qualified candidates; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to
maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand
for the Company's services, on the Company's ability to maintain its profit margins; the possibility of the Company incurring liability for its activities, including the activities of its temporary
employees or for events impacting its temporary employees on clients' premises; the success of the Company in attracting, training and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff
employees; and whether governments will impose additional regulations or licensing requirements on personnel services businesses in particular or on employer/employee relationships in general. With
respect to Protiviti, other risks and uncertainties include the fact that future success will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract clients; significant costs and diversion of
management time could be incurred in integrating key personnel into Protiviti; there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance services;
failure of Protiviti to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and the Company could become involved in litigation relating to prior or current transactions or
activities. Further information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in Item 1. Business under the heading "Risk Factors". Because long-term contracts are not a
significant part of the Company's business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results.

Critical Accounting Policies

As described below, the Company's most critical accounting policies are those that involve subjective decisions, assessments or estimates.

Accounts Receivable Allowances.

The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments,
additional allowances may be required. Estimates used in determining the accounts receivable allowances were based on current trends and historical loss statistics. Actual results may differ from
these estimates, which may materially affect the Company's future financial results.

Income Tax Assets and Liabilities.

In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the Company makes
judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations. The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluates the
need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. The likelihood of a material change in the Company's expected realization of these assets is dependent on future
taxable income, its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant
jurisdictions. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding deferred income tax assets and liabilities are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may
materially affect the future financial results of the Company.


Employee Retirement Plans.

The determination of the Company's obligations for certain employee retirement plans is dependent
upon various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates and service periods. Management believes its assumptions are appropriate, however significant differences in actual experience or
significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Company's future financial results.

Goodwill Impairment.

In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

("SFAS 142"), the Company assesses the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible
assets annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. This assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. The
estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management. The Company's
estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to its business model or changes in its
operating performance. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect the future financial results of the Company. The Company completed its annual
goodwill impairment test during the year ended December 31, 2003 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.

Workers' Compensation.

The Company self-insures or retains a portion of the exposure for losses related to
workers' compensation. The Company has established reserves for workers' compensation claims based on historical loss statistics and periodic independent actuarial valuations. While management
believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Company's future financial
results.

Stock Option Plans.

The Company has a long history of issuing stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of
its compensation programs. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow alternative methods of accounting for these plans. The Company has chosen to account for its
stock option plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

("APB 25"). Under APB 25, the
intrinsic value of the options is used to record compensation expense and, as a result, no compensation expense related to stock options is included in determining net income and net income per share
in the Consolidated Financial Statements. As required by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosures

,
calculations of pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, computed in accordance with the method prescribed by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

, are set forth in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2003

Temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.3 billion for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, decreasing by 1% and 22% during 2003 and 2002, respectively. Permanent placement revenues were $95 million, $100 million and $189 million for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, decreasing by 5% and 47% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Staffing services revenue results for the year ended December 31,
2003 were adversely impacted by weak labor markets and soft general economic conditions, particularly in the United States. Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were
$133 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This compares to $42 million for the period May 24, 2002 (inception) to December 31, 2002. The 2003 increase in risk
consulting and internal audit services revenues is primarily due to increased brand acceptance in the marketplace and expanding demand for alternatives to the "big four" accounting firms in providing
risk consulting services. We expect total Company revenues to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2004.


The
Company's temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 325 offices in 43 states, the District of Columbia and ten foreign countries, while Protiviti has more than
30 offices in 20 states and six foreign countries. Revenues from domestic operations represented 82%, 83% and 85% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Revenues from foreign operations represented 18%, 17% and 15% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Gross
margin dollars from the Company's temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance
costs for temporary employees. Gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services are equal to revenues, as there are no direct costs associated with such revenues. Gross margin dollars
for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, insurance costs and reimbursable
expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Company's temporary and consultant staffing services were $610 million, $628 million and $828 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, decreasing by 3% and 24% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Gross margin amounts equaled 35%, 36% and 37% of revenues for temporary and consultant
staffing services for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The lower 2003 temporary and consulting gross margin percentage is primarily the result of higher workers'
compensation and state unemployment costs. Gross margin dollars for the Company's permanent placement staffing division were $95 million, $100 million and $189 million for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, decreasing by 5% and 47% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Gross margin dollars for the Company's risk consulting and internal audit
division were $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This compares to negative $13 million for the period May 24, 2002 (inception) to December 31, 2002.
The 2003 improvement in risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin dollars is primarily the result of higher revenues and improved staff utilization.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $707 million in 2003, compared to $710 million in 2002 and $823 million in 2001. Selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 36%, 37% and 34% for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses
consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. The lower 2003 selling, general and administrative expense percentage resulted primarily from leveraging fixed
operating costs.

For
acquisitions, the Company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets, if any, and then to goodwill.
The Company adopted SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, resulting in the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill that was being amortized over 40 years. The methods used for
evaluating and measuring impairment of certain intangible assets have changed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the
year ended December 31, 2003 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. Net intangible assets, consisting primarily of goodwill, represented 17% of total
assets and 21% of total stockholders' equity at December 31, 2003.

Interest
income for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $3.4 million, $5.5 million and $9.3 million, respectively, while interest expense for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001
was $0.8 million, $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Lower average cash balances in 2003 and lower interest rates during the year yielded lower interest income.

The
provision for income taxes was 45% of income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 38% of income before taxes for each of the years ended December 31,
2002, and 2001. The increase in 2003 is due primarily to losses in certain states and international locations where corresponding tax benefits are not being recognized.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

The change in the Company's liquidity during the past three years is the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for capital expenditures,
the purchase of intangible assets, repurchases of common stock, and principal payments on outstanding notes payable. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has authorized the repurchase, from
time to time, of up to 9.6 million additional shares of the Company's common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. During the year
ended December 31, 2003, the Company repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock on the open market for a total cost of $24.6 million. Additional stock
repurchases were made in connection with employee stock plans, whereby Company shares were tendered by employees for the payment of applicable withholding taxes. During the year ended
December 31, 2003, such repurchases totaled approximately 0.5 million shares at a cost of $7.8 million. Repurchases of securities have been funded with cash generated from
operations. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company generated $123.9 million from operations, used $56.2 million in investing activities and used $8.1 million in
financing activities. This is further enumerated in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The
Company's working capital at December 31, 2003, included $377 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company's working capital requirements consist primarily of the
financing of accounts receivable. While there can be no assurances in this regard, the Company expects that internally generated cash will be sufficient to support the working capital needs of the
Company, the Company's fixed payments, and other obligations on both a short- and long-term basis. In connection with the formation of Protiviti, the Company became the guarantor of
certain former Andersen partners' capital notes, which totaled approximately $3.0 million at December 31, 2003.

The
Company's cash flows generated from operations are also the primary source for funding various contractual obligations. The table below summarizes the Company's major commitments as
of December 31, 2003 (in thousands):

debt obligations consist of promissory notes as well as other forms of indebtedness issued in connection with certain acquisitions and other payment obligations. Operating
lease obligations consist of minimum rental commitments for 2004 and thereafter under non-cancelable leases in effect at December 31, 2003. Purchase obligations consist of purchase commitments
primarily related to software licenses and subscriptions and computer hardware and software maintenance agreements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company's exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the
Company's foreign subsidiaries. Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of the Company's reported earnings, investments in its foreign subsidiaries, and the intercompany transactions with its
foreign subsidiaries.

For
2003, approximately 18% of the Company's revenues were generated outside of the United States. These operations transact business in their functional currency. As a result,
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar have an impact on the Company's reported results. Revenues and


expenses
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Consequently, as the value of the U.S. dollar changes
relative to the currencies of the Company's non-U.S. markets, the Company's reported results vary.

Fluctuations
in currency exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar amount of the Company's stockholders' equity. The assets and liabilities of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries
are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year-end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss).

Company, through its

Accountemps

Resources

divisions, is the world's largest specialized provider of temporary, full-time, and project professionals in the fields of accounting and finance.

Robert Half Legal

(formerly

The
Affiliates

®) provides temporary, project, and full-time staffing of attorneys and specialized support personnel within law firms and corporate legal
departments.

The Creative Group

provides project staffing in the advertising, marketing, and web design fields.

Protiviti

began operations on May 24,
2002, and provides business and technology risk consulting and internal audit services.

Protiviti

, which primarily employs risk consulting and internal audit professionals formerly associated with major
accounting firms, is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. Revenues are predominantly derived from specialized staffing services. The Company operates in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The
Company is a Delaware corporation.

Basis of Presentation.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair
presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented have been included.

Principles of Consolidation.

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries,
all of which are wholly-owned. All intercompany balances have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2002 financial statements to conform to the 2003 presentation.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. As of December 31, 2003, such estimates included allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, workers' compensation losses, income and other
taxes, and certain employee retirement plans.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company derives its revenues from three segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent
placement staffing, and risk consulting and internal audit services. Net service revenues as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations represent services rendered to customers less sales
adjustments and allowances. The Company records revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent in the presentation of revenues and expenses. The Company has concluded that gross reporting is
appropriate because the Company (i) has the risk of identifying and hiring qualified employees, (ii) has the discretion to select the employees and establish their price and duties and (iii) bears the
risk for services that are not fully paid for by customers.

Temporary
and consultant staffing revenues—Temporary and consultant staffing revenues are recognized when the services are rendered by the Company's temporary employees.
Temporary employees placed by the Company are the Company's legal employees while they are working on assignments. The Company pays all related costs of employment, including workers' compensation
insurance, state and


federal
unemployment taxes, social security and certain fringe benefits. The Company assumes the risk of acceptability of its employees to its customers.

Permanent
placement staffing revenues—Permanent placement staffing revenues are recognized when employment candidates accept offers of permanent employment. The Company has a
substantial history of estimating the effect of permanent placement candidates who do not remain with its clients through the 90-day guarantee period. Allowances are established to estimate these
losses. Fees to clients are generally calculated as a percentage of the new employee's annual compensation. No fees for permanent placement services are charged to employment candidates.

Risk
consulting and internal audit revenues—Risk consulting and internal audit services are generally provided on a time-and-material basis or fixed-fee basis. Revenues
earned under time-and-material arrangements are recognized as services are provided. Revenues on fixed-fee arrangements
are recognized using a proportional performance method as hours are incurred relative to total estimated hours for the engagement. The Company periodically evaluates the need to provide for any losses
on these projects, and losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred. Reimbursements, including those relating to travel and out-of-pocket expenses, are included in risk
consulting and internal audit service revenues, and equivalent amounts of reimbursable expenses are included in direct costs of services.

Costs of Services.

Direct costs of staffing services consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance costs for the Company's
temporary employees. There are no direct costs associated with permanent placement staffing services. Risk consulting and internal audit costs of services include professional staff payroll, payroll
taxes and insurance costs, as well as reimbursable expenses.

Advertising Costs.

The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity at the date of purchase of
three months or less as cash equivalents.

Intangible Assets.

Intangible assets primarily consist of the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair market value
of their net tangible assets at the date of acquisition. The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

("SFAS 142"), on January 1, 2002. Under SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life. The methods used for
evaluating and measuring impairment of certain intangible assets have changed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the
year ended December 31, 2003 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.

Income Tax Assets and Liabilities.

In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the Company makes
judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations. The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluates the
need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. The likelihood of a material change in the Company's expected realization of these assets is dependent on future
taxable income, its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant
jurisdictions.

Foreign Currency Translation.

The results of operations of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated at the monthly
average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The financial position of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is translated at the current exchange rates at the end of the period, and the


related
translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders' Equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are
included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and have not been material for all periods presented.

Stock Option Plans.

The Company accounts for its stock option plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

("APB 25"). Under APB 25, the intrinsic value of the options is used to record compensation
expense and, as a result, no compensation expense related to stock options is included in determining net income and net income per share in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Had compensation
expense for the stock options granted been based on the estimated fair value at the award dates, as prescribed by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

("SFAS 123"), the Company's pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share would have been as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

The
fair value of each option is estimated, as of the grant date, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants in 2003, 2002 and 2001: no
dividend yield for any year; expected volatility of 48% to 60%; risk-free interest rates of 2.1% to 6.8%; and expected lives of 1.5 to 6.0 years.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is computed using the
straight-line method over the following useful lives:

Computer hardware

3 years

Computer software

2 to 5 years

Furniture and equipment

5 years

Leasehold improvements

Term of lease, 5 years maximum

Internal-use Software.

The Company capitalizes direct costs incurred in the development of
internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are reported as a component of computer software within property and equipment. The Company capitalized approximately $10.8 million of
internal-use software development costs for the year ended December 31, 2003.


Note B—New Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") finalized EITF 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables

("EITF 00-21"). EITF 00-21 addresses the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements, which involve more than one deliverable or
unit of accounting in circumstances where the delivery of those units takes place in different accounting periods. EITF 00-21 requires disclosures of the accounting policy for revenue
recognition of multiple element revenue arrangements and the nature and description of such arrangements. The accounting and reporting requirements are effective for revenue arrangements entered into
in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00-21 does not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

In
December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 132 (Revised),

Employer's Disclosure about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits

("Revised SFAS 132"). Revised SFAS 132 retains disclosure requirements in original SFAS 132 and requires additional disclosures
relating to assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost. Revised SFAS 132 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, except that certain disclosures
are effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. Interim period disclosures are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. The Company currently does not
have any broad-based pension or postretirement benefit plans which require disclosure. Accordingly, the adoption of Revised SFAS 132 does not have a significant impact on the Company's
financial statements.

In
2002, the Company completed its arrangement to hire professionals formerly associated with the internal audit and business and technology risk consulting practice of Arthur Andersen
LLP. These professionals formed the base of

Protiviti

. The Company paid $16.1 million, including transaction costs, to secure the release of

Protiviti

employees from their covenants not to compete or solicit. Subsequently, the Company made additional risk consulting business acquisitions of
$3.1 million and recorded intangible assets of $2.6 million as a result. Substantially all of these intangible assets were fully amortized at December 31, 2003.

In
2003, the Company completed the acquisition of its last two independent Robert Half franchises with offices in New Orleans, Louisiana, Overland Park, Kansas, and Kansas City,
Missouri. The Company paid approximately $17.6 million for the purchase of intangibles and other assets, including goodwill of $16.6 million and amortizable intangible assets of
approximately $1.0 million that are being amortized over 2 to 4 years. The estimated remaining amortization expense is $0.3 million for 2004, and $0.4 million thereafter.

The
Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the year ended December 31, 2003, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was
required. The Company will perform annual assessments for impairment, applying a discounted cash flow-based test to its reportable units, which are its various lines of business.

The
Company adopted SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, resulting in the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill that was being amortized over 40 years. Under SFAS 142, goodwill
is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life. Had goodwill not been amortized in the year ended


December 31,
2001, the Company's pro forma net income and net income per share would have been as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

in employee benefits and retirement obligations is $36 million at December 31, 2003 and $42 million at December 31, 2002 related to a defined benefit
retirement agreement for the Company's key executive. The amount of this obligation has been calculated in accordance with the current provisions of the employee's retirement agreement, which was
initially entered into in 1985. The key assumptions used in this calculation include: expected retirement age, mortality, expected post retirement Consumer Price Index increases of 3.1% and 3.4%, and
discount rates of 4.7% and 5.3% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Note G—Notes Payable and Other Indebtedness

The Company issued promissory notes as well as other forms of indebtedness in connection with certain acquisitions and other payment obligations. These are due in
varying installments, carry varying interest rates and, in aggregate, amounted to $2.4 million at December 31, 2003 and $2.5 million at December 31, 2002. At
December 31, 2003, $2.2 million of the notes were collateralized by a standby letter of credit. The following table shows the schedule of maturities for notes payable and other
indebtedness at December 31, 2003 (in thousands):

The
Company has an uncommitted letter of credit facility ("the facility") of up to $30.0 million, which is available to cover the issuance of debt support standby letters of
credit. The Company had used $26.6 million in debt support standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2003 and $20.4 million as of December 31, 2002. There is a service
fee of 1.0% on the used portion of the facility. The facility is subject to certain financial covenants and expires on August 31, 2004.

expire in 2007 and later. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards in foreign countries, with a related foreign tax credit of $4.0 million which expires in 2007 and later. Accrued
expenses, deducted for tax when paid include approximately $4.5 million related to 2003 property and equipment additions.

The
Company has not provided deferred income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on $25.9 million and $28.5 million of undistributed earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, since the Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely.

Note I—Commitments and Contingencies

Rental expense, primarily for office premises, amounted to $72.2 million, $69.7 million and $62.8 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The approximate minimum rental commitments for 2004 and thereafter under non-cancelable leases in effect at December 31, 2003 were as

The
Company is involved in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. While management does not expect any of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, litigation is subject to certain inherent uncertainties.

In
connection with the formation of Protiviti, the Company became the guarantor of certain employee notes totaling $3.0 million at December 31, 2003.


Note J—Stockholders' Equity

Stock Repurchase Program.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase,
from time to time, of up to 9.6 million additional shares of the Company's common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. During the
year ended December 31, 2003, the Company repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares on the open market for a total cost of $24.6 million. Additional stock repurchases were made
in connection with employee stock plans, whereby Company shares were tendered by employees for the payment of applicable withholding taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2003, such
repurchases totaled approximately 0.5 million shares at a cost of $7.8 million.

Note K—Stock Plans

Under various stock plans, officers, employees and outside directors may receive grants of restricted stock or options to purchase common stock. Grants are made
at the discretion of a Committee of the Board of Directors. Grants generally vest between two and four years.

Options
granted under the plans have exercise prices ranging from 85% to 100% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant and may consist of both
incentive stock options and nonstatutory stock options under the Internal Revenue Code. The terms range from 27 months to 10 years.

Recipients
of restricted stock do not pay any cash consideration to the Company for the shares, have the right to vote all shares subject to such grant, and receive all dividends with
respect to such shares, whether or not the shares have vested. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Vesting is accelerated upon the death or disability
of the recipients.

The
Company accounts for these plans under APB 25. Therefore, the intrinsic value of the options is used to record compensation expense and, as a result, no compensation expense has been
recognized for its stock option plans. As required by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure

,
calculations of pro forma net income and net income per share, computed in accordance with the method prescribed by SFAS 123, are set forth in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2003 excludes the dilutive effect of approximately 11.8 million options, since such
options have an exercise price in excess of the 2003 average market value of the Company's common stock. Had such options been included, the dilutive effect would have been calculated using the
treasury method.

Note M—Business Segments

The Company, which defines its segments based on the nature of services, has three reportable segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement
staffing, and risk consulting and internal audit services. The temporary and consultant segment provides specialized staffing in the accounting and finance, administrative and office, information
technology, legal, advertising, marketing and web design fields. The permanent placement segment provides full-time personnel in the accounting, finance, administrative and office, and
information technology fields. The risk consulting segment provides business and technology risk consulting and internal audit services.

The
accounting policies of the segments are set forth in Note A—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The Company evaluates performance based on income or loss
from operations before interest income, intangible amortization expense, and income taxes.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Robert Half International Inc.:

In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position and the related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Robert Half International Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. The financial statements
of the Company as of December 31, 2001 and for the year then ended were audited by other independent accountants who have ceased operations. Those independent accountants expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements in their report dated January 18, 2002.

As
further described in Note D to the financial statements, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", became effective
for calendar year filing companies on January 1, 2002. As a result, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill as of January 1, 2002 and as required by SFAS 142, amended its footnote
disclosure to provide comparative pro forma information for the year ended December 31, 2001. As discussed above, the financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2001, and for
the year then ended, were audited by other independent accountants who have ceased operations. We audited the pro forma disclosures described in Note D. In our opinion, the pro forma
disclosures for 2001 in Note D are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 financial statements of the Company
other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 financial statements taken as a whole.

This is a copy of the audit report previously issued by Arthur Andersen LLP in connection with Robert Half International Inc.'s filing on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2001. This audit report has not been reissued by Arthur Andersen LLP in connection with this filing on Form 10-K. See Exhibit 23.2 for further discussion. This audit report
was issued before the Company's adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors

of Robert Half International Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Robert Half International Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001
and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Robert Half International Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

San
Francisco, California

January 18, 2002


Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Prior to April 24, 2002, Arthur Andersen LLP served as the Company's independent accountants. On April 24, 2002, the Company reached a
tentative agreement with Andersen to hire partners and other employees within Andersen's U.S. internal audit and business risk consulting practices. Andersen and the Company's Board of Directors and
Audit Committee determined that execution of the agreement would cause Andersen to no longer be independent. The Company's auditing relationship with Andersen was therefore severed by mutual agreement
effective April 24, 2002.

During
the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, and the subsequent interim periods through the termination of the relationship with Andersen,
there was no disagreement between Andersen and the Company, as defined in Item 304 of Regulation S-K, on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused Andersen to make reference to the subject matter of such disagreement in
connection with its reports, and there occurred no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

The
audit reports of Andersen on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 did not contain an
adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

The
Company provided Andersen with a copy of the foregoing statements. Exhibit 16 is a copy of Andersen's letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission dated April 26,
2002, stating its agreement with such statements.

On
July 16, 2002, the Company engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as its independent accountant. From January 1, 2000, through such date, neither the Company nor anyone
acting on its behalf consulted PricewaterhouseCoopers regarding either (a) the application of accounting principles to any specified transaction, either completed or proposed, (b) the
type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements or (c) any disagreement or reportable event described in Section 304(a) of
Regulation S-K.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Management, including the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice
Chairman and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

There
have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 that occurred during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or its reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial
reporting.
