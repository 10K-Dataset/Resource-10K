                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

    Robert  Half International Inc. is  the world's largest specialized provider
of temporary and permanent  personnel in the fields  of accounting and  finance.
Its    divisions   include   ACCOUNTEMPS-Registered    Trademark-   and   ROBERT
HALF-Registered Trademark-,  providers  of temporary  and  permanent  personnel,
respectively,  in the fields  of accounting and  finance. The Company, utilizing
its experience as a specialized  provider of temporary and permanent  personnel,
has  expanded into  additional specialty fields.  In December  1991, the Company
formed   OFFICETEAM-Registered   Trademark-   to   provide   skilled   temporary
administrative   and  office  personnel.  In  1992,  the  Company  acquired  THE
AFFILIATES-Registered  Trademark-,  which  focuses  on  placing  temporary   and
permanent  employees in paralegal, legal  administrative and other legal support
positions. In addition, the Company  recently established RHI CONSULTING-SM-  to
concentrate  on  providing  temporary  information  technology  professionals in
positions ranging  from  PC/LAN  technician to  system  design  and  application
programmer.

    The  Company's business was  originally founded in 1948.  Prior to 1986, the
Company was  primarily a  franchisor  of ACCOUNTEMPS  and ROBERT  HALF  offices.
Beginning in 1986, the Company and its current management embarked on a strategy
of  acquiring  franchised  locations  and other  local  or  regional independent
providers of specialized temporary service  personnel. The Company has  acquired
all  but  five of  the ACCOUNTEMPS  and  ROBERT HALF  franchises in  45 separate
transactions,  and  has  acquired  14  other  local  or  regional  providers  of
specialized   temporary  service   personnel.  Since   1986,  the   Company  has
significantly expanded  operations at  many of  the acquired  locations and  has
opened  over 50  new locations.  The Company  believes that  direct ownership of
offices allows it to better monitor and protect the image of the ACCOUNTEMPS and
ROBERT HALF names, promotes  a more consistent and  higher level of quality  and
service  throughout  its  network  of  offices  and  improves  profitability  by
centralizing many of  its administrative  functions. The  Company currently  has
more  than  180 offices  in  36 states  and  five foreign  countries  and placed
approximately 85,000 employees on temporary assignment with clients in 1994.

ACCOUNTEMPS

    The ACCOUNTEMPS temporary services division offers customers a reliable  and
economical  means of dealing with uneven or  peak work loads for accounting, tax
and finance personnel  caused by  such predictable events  as vacations,  taking
inventories,  tax  work,  month-end  activities and  special  projects  and such
unpredictable events as  illness and emergencies.  Businesses increasingly  view
the  use of temporary  employees as a  means of controlling  personnel costs and
converting such costs  from fixed  to variable.  The cost  and inconvenience  to
clients  of hiring and firing  permanent employees are eliminated  by the use of
ACCOUNTEMPS temporaries. The temporary workers are employees of ACCOUNTEMPS  and
are  paid by ACCOUNTEMPS only when working on customer assignments. The customer
pays a fixed rate only for hours worked.

    ACCOUNTEMPS clients may fill  their permanent employment  needs by using  an
ACCOUNTEMPS  employee  on a  trial basis  and, if  so desired,  "converting" the
temporary position to a permanent position. The client typically pays a one-time
fee for such conversions.

    The ACCOUNTEMPS business accounted for 75% of the Company's revenue in  1993
and 66% of the Company's revenue in 1994.

OFFICETEAM

    The  Company's  OFFICETEAM  division, which  commenced  operations  in 1991,
places temporary and permanent office and administrative personnel, ranging from
word processors  to office  managers,  from over  125  locations in  the  United
States.  OFFICETEAM operates  in much  the same  fashion as  the ACCOUNTEMPS and
ROBERT HALF  divisions.  The  OFFICETEAM  business  accounted  for  14%  of  the
Company's revenue in 1993 and 19% of the Company's revenue in 1994.


ROBERT HALF

    The  Company offers permanent placement  services through its office network
under the name ROBERT  HALF. The Company's ROBERT  HALF division specializes  in
placing  accounting, financial, tax  and banking personnel.  Fees for successful
permanent placements  are  paid  only  by  the  employer  and  are  generally  a
percentage  of  the new  employee's annual  compensation.  No fee  for permanent
placement services is charged to employment candidates.

    The ROBERT HALF business accounted for  9% of the Company's revenue in  1993
and 1994.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

    In  1992, the Company  acquired THE AFFILIATES,  a small operation involving
only a limited number of offices, which places temporary and permanent employees
in paralegal, legal  administrative and legal  secretarial positions. The  legal
profession's   requirements   (the  need   for  confidentiality,   accuracy  and
reliability,  a  strong  drive  toward  cost-effectiveness,  and  frequent  peak
workload  periods) are similar to the demands  of the clients of the ACCOUNTEMPS
division.

    The  Company  recently  established  its  RHI  CONSULTING  division,   which
specializes  in  providing  information  technology  professionals  ranging from
PC/LAN technician to system design and application programmer.

MARKETING AND RECRUITING

    The  Company  markets  its  services  to  clients  as  well  as   employment
candidates.  Local  marketing and  recruiting  are generally  conducted  by each
office or  related  group  of  offices.  Advertising  directed  to  clients  and
employment   candidates  consists  primarily  of  yellow  pages  advertisements,
classified advertisements and radio. Direct marketing through mail and telephone
solicitation also  constitutes  a significant  portion  of the  Company's  total
advertising. National advertising conducted by the Company consists primarily of
print  advertisements  in  national  newspapers,  magazines  and  certain  trade
journals. Joint  marketing  arrangements  have  been  entered  into  with  Lotus
Development  Corporation, WordPerfect Corporation, Peachtree Software, Inc., and
Computer Associates International,  Inc. and typically  provide for  cooperative
advertising, joint mailings and similar promotional activities. The Company also
actively  seeks endorsements and affiliations with professional organizations in
the business  management,  office administration  and  professional  secretarial
fields.  The  Company  also  conducts public  relations  activities  designed to
enhance public recognition of the Company and its services. Local employees  are
encouraged to be active in civic organizations and industry trade groups.

    The  Company owns many  trademarks, service marks  and tradenames, including
the  ROBERT  HALF-Registered   Trademark-,  ACCOUNTEMPS-Registered   Trademark-,
OFFICETEAM-Registered  Trademark-, THE AFFILIATES-Registered  Trademark- and RHI
CONSULTING-SM- marks, which are registered in the United States and in a  number
of foreign countries.

ORGANIZATION

    Management  of the Company's operations is coordinated from its headquarters
in Menlo  Park,  California. The  Company's  headquarters provides  support  and
centralized   services  to   its  offices  in   the  administrative,  marketing,
accounting, training  and  legal  areas,  particularly  as  it  relates  to  the
standardization of the operating procedures of its offices. The Company has more
than  180 offices in 36  states and five foreign  countries. Office managers are
responsible for  most  activities  of  their  offices,  including  sales,  local
advertising and marketing and recruitment.

COMPETITION

    The  Company faces competition in its efforts  to attract clients as well as
high-quality specialized  employment  candidates. The  temporary  and  permanent
placement  businesses are  highly competitive, with  a number  of firms offering
services similar to  those provided by  the Company on  a national, regional  or
local  basis. In many  areas the local companies  are the strongest competitors.
The  most  significant  competitive  factors  in  the  temporary  and  permanent
placement businesses are price and the reliability of service, both of which are
often   a   function   of   the   availability   and   quality   of   personnel.


The Company believes it derives a competitive advantage from its long experience
with and commitment to the specialized employment market, its national presence,
and its various marketing activities.

EMPLOYEES

    The Company has approximately 1,600 full-time staff employees. The Company's
offices placed  approximately 85,000  employees  on temporary  assignments  with
clients during 1994. Temporary employees placed by the Company are the Company's
employees  for all purposes  while they are working  on assignments. The Company
pays the related costs of  employment, such as workers' compensation  insurance,
state  and  federal  unemployment  taxes,  social  security  and  certain fringe
benefits. The Company provides voluntary health insurance coverage to interested
temporary employees.

    OTHER INFORMATION

    The Company's current business constitutes  a single business segment.  (See
Item  8. Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data  for financial information
about the Company.)

    The Company is not dependent upon a  single customer or a limited number  of
customers.  The Company's operations are generally  more active in the first and
fourth quarters of a calendar  year. Order backlog is  not a material aspect  of
the  Company's business  and no  material portion  of the  Company's business is
subject to  government  contracts.  The  Company  does  not  have  any  material
expenditures  for research  and development.  Compliance with  federal, state or
local environmental  protection  laws has  no  material effect  on  the  capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.

    Information  about foreign  operations is  contained in  Note N  of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in  Item 8. The Company  does not have  export
sales.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

the offices are leased.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    The Company is not a party  to any material pending legal proceedings  other
than routine litigation incidental to its business.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

    No  matter was submitted to a vote  of the Company's security holders during

                                    PART II

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

    The Company's  Common Stock  is listed  for trading  on the  New York  Stock
Exchange  under the symbol "RHI". On February 28, 1995, there were approximately
1,400 holders of record of the Common Stock.

    Following is a list by fiscal quarters  of the sales prices of the stock  as
quoted  on the New York Stock Exchange, adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect the
two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 1994:


    No cash  dividends were  paid in  1994 or  1993. The  Company, as  it  deems
appropriate,  may continue to retain all earnings for use in its business or may
consider paying a dividend in the future.


ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

    Following is a table of selected financial  data of the Company of the  last
five years:


    All shares and per share amounts have been restated to retroactively reflect
the  two-for-one stock split effected in the  form of a stock dividend in August
1994.


ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994

    Temporary services revenues increased 46%  during 1994 and 40% during  1993,
including  the revenues generated from  the Company's OfficeTeam division, which
was  started  in  1991  to  provide  highly-skilled  office  and  administrative
personnel.  Permanent  placement revenues  increased 47%  during the  year ended
December 31, 1994 and 30% during the  year ended December 31, 1993. The  revenue
comparisons  reflect  continued  improvement  in the  demand  for  the Company's
services.

    Gross margin dollars increased 47% during  the year ended December 31,  1994
compared  to 33%  for the  year ended  December 31,  1993. Gross  margin amounts
equaled 39% of revenue in  1994 and 1993. In 1992,  gross margin equaled 40%  of
revenue.  The percentage decline relative to 1992 related primarily to the lower
mix of  the higher  permanent placement  gross margins  and higher  unemployment
insurance costs associated with the temporary services divisions.

    Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $122 million
during  1994 compared to $88  million in 1993 and  $72 million in 1992. Selling,
general and administrative  expenses as  a percentage  of revenues  were 27%  in
1994,  compared to  29% in 1993  and 33%  in 1992. The  percentage declines were
attributable to  revenue  growth  coupled  with  the  Company's  continued  cost
containment.

    Amortization  of intangible  assets increased from  1992 to 1994  due to the
acquisitions in each of those years of additional personnel services operations.

    Interest expense for the  years ended December 31,  1994 and 1993  decreased
61% and 7%, respectively, over the comparable prior periods due primarily to the
conversion  of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures  in the fourth quarter of
1993 and the reduction in outstanding indebtedness.

    The provision for income taxes was 42%  in 1994, as compared to 46% in  1993
and  45% in 1992. The decrease in 1994  is the result of a smaller percentage of
non-deductible  intangible  expenses  relative  to  income.  The  1993  increase
reflects  the effect of the 1% increase in the federal corporate income tax rate
as a result of the 1993 Tax Act. Because of the increase in pre-tax book income,
the effect of the  non-deductible intangible amortization  on the effective  tax
rate was reduced in 1993 as compared to 1992. The Financial Accounting Standards
Board  issued a new standard  on accounting for income  taxes, which the Company
adopted, as required, on January 1, 1993. The cumulative effect of the  adoption
of the accounting method prescribed by the new standard was not material.

    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    The change in the Company's liquidity during the past three years is the net
effect  of funds generated  by operations and  the funds used  for the personnel
services acquisitions, principal payments on outstanding notes payable, and  the
securities repurchase program.

    In November 1994, the Company issued 633,555 shares of its common stock. The
net  proceeds  from the  sale of  shares were  approximately $12.6  million. The
Company used the proceeds  for repayment of the  borrowings under the  Company's
revolving credit agreement.

    On  December  10, 1993,  substantially  all of  its  outstanding convertible
subordinated debentures were  converted into  common stock of  the Company.  See
Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

    The   Company's  working  capital  requirements  consist  primarily  of  the
financing of  accounts receivable.  While there  can be  no assurances  in  this
regard,  the  Company  expects  that internally  generated  cash  plus  the bank
revolving line of credit will be sufficient to support the working capital needs
of the  Company's offices,  the  Company's fixed  payments and  other  long-term
obligations.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.  The Consolidated Financial Statements  include
the  accounts  of  Robert  Half  International  Inc.  (the  "Company")  and  its
subsidiaries,  all  of  which  are  wholly-owned.  The  Company  is  a  Delaware
corporation. All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated. Certain
reclassifications  have been made  to the 1993 and  1992 financial statements to
conform to the 1994 presentation.

    REVENUE RECOGNITION.   Temporary services revenues  are recognized when  the
services  are rendered by the Company's temporary employees. Permanent placement
revenues are recognized  when employment candidates  accept offers of  permanent
employment.  Allowances  are  established  to  estimate  losses  due  to  placed
candidates not  remaining  in employment  for  the Company's  guarantee  period,
typically 90 days.

    FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  Foreign income statement items are translated
at  the monthly  average exchange  rates prevailing  during the  period. Foreign
balance sheets are translated at  the current exchange rates  at the end of  the
period,  and  the  related  translation  adjustments  are  recorded  as  part of
Stockholders'  Equity.  Gains  and   losses  resulting  from  foreign   currency
transactions are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

    CASH  AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  For  purposes of the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows,  the  Company  classifies  all highly  liquid  investments  with  an
original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.

    INTANGIBLE  ASSETS.    Intangible  assets  represent  the  cost  of acquired
companies in excess of  the fair market  value of their  net tangible assets  at
acquisition date, and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period
of 40 years. The carrying value of intangible assets is periodically reviewed by
the  Company and impairments  are recognized when  the expected future operating
cash flows  derived from  such intangible  assets is  less than  their  carrying
value.  Based  upon  its most  recent  analysis,  the Company  believes  that no
material impairment of intangible assets exists at December 31, 1994.

    INCOME TAXES.   Effective  January 1,  1993, the  Company adopted  Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 109, Accounting for  Income Taxes (FAS 109). Under FAS
109, deferred taxes are computed based  on the difference between the  financial
statement  and  income tax  bases of  assets and  liabilities using  the enacted
marginal tax rate.  As permitted under  the provisions of  FAS 109, the  Company
elected not to restate prior years and has determined that the cumulative effect
of implementation was immaterial.

NOTE B -- ACQUISITIONS
    In  July 1986, the Company  acquired all of the  outstanding stock of Robert
Half Incorporated, the franchisor of the Accountemps and Robert Half operations.
Subsequently, in  59  separate transactions  the  Company acquired  all  of  the
outstanding  stock of certain corporations operating Accountemps and Robert Half
franchised offices in the United States,  the United Kingdom and Canada as  well
as  other personnel services businesses. The Company has paid approximately $192
million in  cash, stock,  notes and  other indebtedness  in these  acquisitions,
excluding transaction costs and cash acquired.

    These  acquisitions were accounted for as  purchases, and the excess of cost
over the  fair  market  value of  the  net  tangible assets  acquired  is  being
amortized over 40 years using the straight-line method. Results of operations of
the  acquired companies  are included in  the Consolidated  Statements of Income
from the dates of acquisition. The acquisitions made during 1994 and 1993 had no
material pro forma impact on the results of operations.


             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE C -- NOTES PAYABLE AND OTHER INDEBTEDNESS
    The Company issued promissory notes as  well as other forms of  indebtedness
in  connection with certain acquisitions. These are due in varying installments,
carry varying interest rates and in aggregate amounted to $4,214,000 at December
31, 1994,  and $2,440,000  at December  31,  1993. At  December 31,  1994,  $1.8
million of the notes was secured by a standby letter of credit (see Note D). The
following  table shows  the schedule of  maturities for notes  payable and other
indebtedness at December 31, 1994 (in thousands):



    At December  31, 1994,  all of  the notes  carried fixed  rates of  interest
ranging from 4.1% to 13.3%. The weighted average interest rate for the above was
approximately  8.2%, 11.1% and 8.5% for the  years ended December 31, 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively.

    As part  of  a  Restructuring  in  1987,  a  newly  formed  corporation,  BF
Enterprises,  Inc., assumed  the obligation for  certain subordinated debentures
issued by  a predecessor  of the  Company.  At December  31, 1994,  the  Company
remains  contingently liable for $3.6  million of these subordinated debentures,
payment of  $3.4 million  of which  has been  provided for  by the  issuance  of
letters  of credit  to the  trustee for the  debentures by  BF Enterprises, Inc.
Additionally, pursuant to a  pledge and security agreement  entered into at  the
time of Restructuring, BF Enterprises, Inc., has agreed to pledge to the Company
collateral (consisting of real estate, marketable securities and bank letters of
credit)  if the net worth  of BF Enterprises, Inc.,  falls below certain minimum
levels.

NOTE D -- BANK LOAN (REVOLVING CREDIT)
    The bank  loan is  an unsecured  credit facility  which provides  a line  of
credit  of up to $80,000,000,  which is available to  fund the Company's general
business and working capital needs,  including acquisitions and the purchase  of
the  Company's common stock, and  to cover the issuance  of debt support standby
letters of credit up to $15,000,000.

    As of December 31, 1994, the Company had no borrowings on the line of credit
outstanding and had used $3,358,000 in  debt support standby letters of  credit.
There is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the entire credit facility of

NOTE D -- BANK LOAN (REVOLVING CREDIT) (CONTINUED)
    As of December 31, 1993, the Company had borrowed $30,300,000 on the line of
credit and had used $2,780,000 in debt support standby letters of credit. Of the
$30,300,000  outstanding loan balance at  December 31, 1993, $29,000,000 carried
an interest rate tied to Eurodollar  rates plus 1.25% and the remaining  balance
of $1,300,000 carried an interest rate at prime.

NOTE E -- CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES
    On  August  6, 1987,  the Company  issued  $74,750,000 of  7.25% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures (the "Convertible Debentures").  Prior to 1993, all  but
$22,745,000  of  the  Convertible  Debentures were  repurchased  by  the Company
pursuant to its repurchase program (see Note F). The Convertible Debentures were
unsecured obligations of the Company with an original maturity date of August 1,
2012. Interest was payable semi-annually as of  February 1 and August 1 of  each
year  to the  registered holders  as of  the preceding  January 15  and July 15,
respectively. The Convertible Debentures were redeemable at the Company's option
at any time on or after August 1, 1990, at declining redemption prices.

    In December  1993,  the  Company  called for  redemption  all  of  its  then
outstanding  Convertible Debentures. Holders of  $22,440,000 in principal amount
elected to convert their debentures into 2.04 million shares of common stock  at
the  conversion price of  $11.00 per share. The  remaining $305,000 in principal
amount of Convertible Debentures was redeemed at 102.9% of the principal  amount
plus accrued interest.

NOTE F -- STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
    On  June  27, 1994,  the  stockholders of  the  Company voted  to  amend the
certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of  the
Company's  common stock from 30,000,000 to  100,000,000 shares and the number of
authorized shares of the  Company's preferred stock  from 500,000 to  5,000,000.
The stockholders of the Company also authorized a reduction in par value from $1
per share to $.001 per share on both classes of shares.

    In  August 1994, the Company effected a  two-for-one stock split in the form
of a stock  dividend. All  share and  per share  amounts have  been restated  to
retroactively reflect the two-for-one stock split.

    In November 1994, the Company issued 633,555 shares of its common stock at a
price  of $21.25  per share.  The net  proceeds from  the sale  of shares (after
deducting issuance  costs  of  approximately $355,000  and  a  4%  underwriter's
discount) were approximately $12.6 million.

NOTE G -- INCOME TAXES
    The provisions for income taxes for the three years ended December 31, 1994,
consisted of the following (in thousands):

    During  the fourth quarter of 1992,  the Company recorded a one-time benefit
of $400,000  for the  resolution of  certain tax  accounting issues  related  to
previous acquisitions.

    The deferred income tax liability shown on the balance sheet is comprised of
the following (in thousands):



    No  valuation allowances against  deferred tax assets  were required for the
years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993.

    The components of the net deferred income tax liability at December 31, 1994
and 1993, were as follows (in thousands):



NOTE H -- EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
    Under a  retirement  plan covering  one  current and  one  former  executive
officer  of  the Company,  monthly  benefits are  payable  equal to  25%  of the
participant's base compensation as defined,  increased by an inflation  formula.
The  plan was amended  effective May 31,  1992, to provide  a fixed supplemental
benefit for the current employee during the first 15 years after retirement. The
current employee forfeited long-term incentive awards of equal value in exchange
for this amendment. The plan  was also amended effective  May 21, 1991, for  the
current employee to increase the percentage of


             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE H -- EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (CONTINUED)
base  compensation to 30% increasing  thereafter by 3% for  each year of service
beyond the age of 50, up to a  maximum of 66%. During 1993, the Company  changed
its  discount rate assumption from 8% to  6%. The effect of both plan amendments
and the discount rate  change are being amortized  over the employee's  expected
future  service period (initially 15 years)  and will increase after-tax expense
by approximately  $76,000 per  year. The  employee can  require the  Company  to
discharge  its  liability  at  defined  intervals  by  purchasing  annuities. At
December 31,  1992, a  liability  of $1,124,000  was  established to  cover  the
estimated  unfunded  cost  of  these  benefits.  This  amount  was  increased to
$1,721,000 at  December 31,  1993,  and at  December  31, 1994,  is  $1,827,000.
Pre-tax  pension costs for these plans were $232,000, $188,000, and $131,000 for
the years ended December  31, 1994, 1993 and  1992, respectively. These  charges
were  computed using certain assumptions  regarding salary increases, retirement
age and life expectancy.

NOTE I -- COMMITMENTS
    Rental expense,  primarily  for  office premises,  amounted  to  $9,183,000,
$8,457,000  and $8,042,000 for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. The approximate minimum rental commitments for 1995 and thereafter
under non-cancelable leases in effect at  December 31, 1994, are as follows  (in
thousands):



NOTE J -- STOCK PLANS
    Under  various stock  plans, officers,  employees and  outside directors may
receive grants of restricted stock or  options to purchase common stock.  Grants
are  made  at the  discretion  of the  Compensation  Committee of  the  Board of
Directors. Grants usually vest over four years.

    Options granted under  the plans have  exercise prices ranging  from 85%  to
100%  of the  fair market  value of the  Company's common  stock at  the date of
grant, consist of both  incentive stock options  and nonstatutory stock  options
under the Internal Revenue Code, and generally have a term of ten years.

    Recipients  of restricted  stock do  not pay  any cash  consideration to the
Company for the shares, have the right to vote all shares subject to such grant,
and receive all dividends with respect to such shares, whether or not the shares
have vested.

    As of December 31, 1994 the total number of available grants under the plans
(consisting of either restricted stock or options) was 340,227.

NOTE J -- STOCK PLANS (CONTINUED)
    The following table reflects activity under all stock plans from January  1,
1992 through December 31, 1994 and the exercise prices:



    As  of  December 31,  1994, an  aggregate of  1,235,574 options  to purchase
common stock were vested.

NOTE K -- PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
    Pursuant to the Company's stockholder rights agreement, each share of common
stock carries one right  to purchase one two-hundredth  of a share of  preferred
stock.  The rights become exercisable in certain limited circumstances involving
a potential business combination transaction or an acquisition of shares of  the
Company  and  are  exercisable  at  a price  of  $32.50  per  right,  subject to
adjustment. Following certain other events after the rights become  exercisable,
each  right entitles its holder to purchase for $32.50 an amount of common stock
of the Company, or, in certain circumstances, securities of the acquiror, having
a then-current market value of twice the exercise price of the right. The rights
are redeemable and  may be amended  at the Company's  option before they  become
exercisable.  Until a right is exercised, the holder of a right has no rights as
a stockholder of the Company. The rights expire on July 23, 2000.


             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE L -- INCOME PER SHARE
    Income  per fully diluted share has been computed using the weighted average
number of shares  of fully  diluted common  stock and  common stock  equivalents
outstanding during each period (28,484,000, 25,260,000 and 24,007,000 shares for
the  years ending  December 31, 1994,  1993 and 1992,  respectively). An assumed
conversion of the Convertible Debentures was not dilutive to income per share in
1993 (see Note E) or 1992.

    The following tabulation shows certain quarterly financial data for 1994 and
1993 (in thousands, except per share amounts):


NOTE N -- SEGMENT REPORTING

for each of  the three years  in the period  ended December 31,  1994, is  shown
below.  The Company's areas  of operations outside of  the United States include
Canada, the  United  Kingdom,  Belgium, France  and  the  Netherlands.  Revenues
represent  total net  revenues from  the respective  geographic areas. Operating
income is net revenues less operating costs and expenses pertaining to  specific
geographic  areas. Foreign operating income reflects charges for U.S. management
fees and amortization of intangibles of $956,000, $917,000 and $854,000 for  the
years  ended December 31, 1994, 1993  and 1992, respectively. Domestic operating
income  reflects  charges  for   amortization  of  intangibles  of   $4,137,000,

    We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of financial
position  of  Robert  Half  International  Inc.  (a  Delaware  corporation)  and

responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express  an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

    We  conducted  our audits  in  accordance with  generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also  includes
assessing  the  accounting principles  used  and significant  estimates  made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement  presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In  our opinion, the financial statements  referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects,  the financial position  of Robert Half  International
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
