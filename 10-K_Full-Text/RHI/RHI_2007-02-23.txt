Robert Half International Inc. (the “Company”) provides specialized
staffing and risk consulting services through such divisions as

®

, Robert

®

Technology, Robert Half

and

. The Company, through its

Accountemps, Robert Half Finance & Accounting

,
and

Robert Half Management Resources

divisions, is the world’s largest specialized provider of temporary, full-time, and project professionals in the fields of accounting and finance.

OfficeTeam

specializes in highly skilled
temporary administrative support personnel.

Robert Half Technology

provides information technology professionals.

Robert Half Legal

provides temporary, project, and full-time staffing of attorneys and specialized support personnel
within law firms and corporate legal departments.

The Creative Group

provides project staffing in the advertising, marketing, and web design fields.

Protiviti

began operations in May 2002 and provides business and technology risk
consulting and internal audit services.

Protiviti

, which primarily employs risk consulting and internal audit professionals formerly associated with major accounting firms, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

The Company’s business was originally founded in 1948. Prior to 1986, the Company was primarily a franchisor, under the names

Accountemps

and

Robert Half

(now called

Robert Half Finance & Accounting

), of offices providing temporary and full-time professionals in the fields of accounting and finance. Beginning in 1986, the Company and its current management embarked on a
strategy of acquiring franchised locations. All of the franchises have been acquired. The Company believes that direct ownership of offices allows it to better monitor and protect the image of its tradenames, promotes a more consistent and higher
level of quality and service throughout its network of offices and improves profitability by centralizing many of its administrative functions. Since 1986, the Company has significantly expanded operations at many of the acquired locations, opened
many new locations and acquired other local or regional providers of specialized temporary service personnel. The Company has also expanded the scope of its services by launching the new product lines

OfficeTeam

,

Robert Half
Technology

,

Robert Half Management Resources

,

Robert Half Legal

and

The Creative Group

.

In 2002, the Company
hired more than 700 professionals who had been affiliated with the internal audit and business and technology risk consulting practice of Arthur Andersen LLP, including more than 50 individuals who had been partners of Andersen. These professionals
formed the base of the Company’s new Protiviti Inc. subsidiary.

Protiviti

®

has enabled the Company to enter the market for independent internal audit and business and technology risk consulting services, which market the Company believes offers synergies with its traditional lines of
business.

Accountemps

The

Accountemps

temporary services division offers customers a reliable and economical means of dealing with uneven or peak work loads for accounting, tax and finance personnel caused by such predictable events as vacations, taking inventories,
tax work, month-end activities and special projects and such unpredictable events as illness and emergencies. Businesses view the use of temporary employees as a means of controlling personnel costs and converting such costs from fixed to variable.
The cost and inconvenience to clients of hiring and firing regular employees are eliminated by the use of

Accountemps

temporaries. The temporary workers are employees of

Accountemps

and are paid by

Accountemps

only when working
on customer assignments. The customer pays a fixed rate only for hours worked.

Accountemps

clients may fill their regular
employment needs by using an

Accountemps

employee on a trial basis and, if so desired, “converting” the temporary position to a regular position. The client typically pays a one-time fee for such conversions.


OfficeTeam

The Company’s

OfficeTeam

division, which commenced operations in 1991, places temporary and full-time office and administrative personnel, ranging from word processors to office managers.

OfficeTeam

operates in much the
same fashion as the

Accountemps

and

Robert Half Finance & Accounting

divisions.

Robert Half Finance & Accounting

The Company’s

Robert Half Finance & Accounting

division specializes in the placement of full-time accounting, financial, tax and
banking personnel. Fees for successful placements are paid only by the employer and are generally a percentage of the new employee’s annual compensation. No fee for placement services is charged to employment candidates.

Robert Half Technology

The Company’s

Robert
Half Technology

division, which commenced operations in 1994, specializes in providing information technology contract consultants and placing full-time employees in areas ranging from multiple platform systems integration to end-user support,
including specialists in programming, networking, systems integration, database design and help desk support.

Robert Half Legal

Since 1992, the Company has been placing temporary and full-time employees in attorney, paralegal, legal administrative and legal secretarial positions
through its

Robert Half Legal

division. The legal profession’s requirements (the need for confidentiality, accuracy and reliability, a strong drive toward cost-effectiveness, and frequent peak workload periods) are similar to the demands
of the clients of the

Accountemps

division.

Robert Half Management Resources

The Company’s

Robert Half Management Resources

division, which commenced operations in 1997, specializes in providing senior level project
professionals in the accounting and finance fields, including chief financial officers, controllers, and senior financial analysts, for such tasks as financial systems conversions, expansion into new markets, business process reengineering and
post-merger financial consolidation.

The Creative Group

The Creative Group

division commenced operations in 1999 and serves clients in the areas of advertising, marketing and web design and places project consultants in a variety of positions such as creative
directors, graphics designers, web content developers, web designers, media buyers, and public relations specialists.

Protiviti

Protiviti

provides independent internal audit and business and technology risk consulting services.

Protiviti

helps clients identify,
measure, and manage operational and technology-related risks they face within their industries and throughout their systems and processes.

Protiviti

offers a full spectrum of professional consulting services, technologies, and skills for
business and technology risk management and the continual transformation of internal audit functions.

Marketing and Recruiting

The Company markets its staffing services to clients as well as employment candidates. Local marketing and recruiting are generally conducted by each
office or related group of offices. Local advertising directed to


clients and employment candidates consists of radio, yellow pages, websites and trade shows. Direct marketing through e-mail, regular mail and telephone
solicitation also constitutes a significant portion of the Company’s total advertising. National advertising conducted by the Company consists primarily of radio and of print advertisements in national newspapers, magazines and trade journals.
Additionally, the Company has expanded its use of job boards in all aspects of sales and recruitment. Joint marketing arrangements have been entered into with major software manufacturers and typically provide for development of proprietary skills
tests, cooperative advertising, joint mailings and similar promotional activities. The Company also actively seeks endorsements and affiliations with professional organizations in the business management, office administration and professional
secretarial fields. The Company also conducts public relations activities designed to enhance public recognition of the Company and its services. Local employees are encouraged to be active in civic organizations and industry trade groups.

Protiviti

markets its risk consulting and internal audit services to a variety of clients in a range of industries. Industry and
competency teams conduct targeted marketing efforts, both locally and nationally, including print advertising and branded speaking events, with support from

Protiviti

management. National advertising conducted by

Protiviti

consists
primarily of print advertisements in national newspapers, magazines and selected trade journals.

Protiviti

has initiated a national direct mail program to share information with clients on current corporate governance and risk management
issues. It conducts public relations activities, such as press releases and newsletters, designed to enhance recognition for the

Protiviti

brand, establish its expertise in key issues surrounding its business and promote its services.

Protiviti

plans to expand both the services and value added content on the

Protiviti.com

website and increase traffic through targeted Internet advertising. Local employees are encouraged to be active in civic organizations and
industry trade groups.

The Company and its subsidiaries own many trademarks, service marks and tradenames, including the

Organization

Management of the Company’s
staffing operations is coordinated from its headquarters facilities in Menlo Park and Pleasanton, California. The Company’s headquarters provides support and centralized services to its offices in the administrative, marketing, public
relations, accounting, training and legal areas, particularly as it relates to the standardization of the operating procedures of its offices. As of December 31, 2006, the Company conducted its staffing services operations through more than 350
offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and seventeen foreign countries. Office managers are responsible for most activities of their offices, including sales, local advertising and marketing and recruitment.

The day-to-day operations of

Protiviti

are managed by a committee consisting of key operating personnel, with operational and administrative
support provided by individuals located in Pleasanton and Menlo Park, California. As of December 31, 2006,

Protiviti

had more than 55 offices in 22 states and fourteen foreign countries.

Competition

The Company’s staffing services
face competition in attracting clients as well as skilled specialized employment candidates. The staffing business is highly competitive, with a number of firms offering services similar to those provided by the Company on a national, regional or
local basis. In many areas the local companies are the strongest competitors. The most significant competitive factors in the staffing business are price and the reliability of service, both of which are often a function of the availability and
quality of personnel. The Company believes it derives a competitive advantage from its long experience with and commitment to the specialized employment market, its national presence, and its various marketing activities.


Protiviti

faces competition in its efforts to attract clients and win proposal presentations. The
risk consulting and internal audit businesses are highly competitive due to many new firms entering the market and the evolution of established firms in the business space. In addition, the changing regulatory environment is increasing opportunities
for non-attestation audit and risk consulting services. The principal competitors of

Protiviti

remain the “big four” accounting firms. Significant competitive factors include reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies,
price of services and depth of skills of personnel.

Protiviti

believes its competitive strengths lie in its unique ability to couple the deep skills and proven methodologies of its “big four” heritage with the customer focus and
attention of a smaller organization.

Employees

The Company has approximately 13,400 full-time staff employees, including approximately 2,800 engaged directly in

Protiviti

operations. The Company placed approximately 242,000 employees on temporary assignments with clients during
2006. Temporary employees placed by the Company are the Company’s employees for all purposes while they are working on assignments. The Company pays the related costs of employment, such as workers’ compensation insurance, state and
federal unemployment taxes, social security and certain fringe benefits. The Company provides access to voluntary health insurance coverage to interested temporary employees.

Other Information

The Company’s current business constitutes three business segments. (See Note
M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for financial information about the Company’s segments.)

The Company is not dependent upon a single customer or a limited number of customers. The Company’s staffing services operations are generally more active in the first and fourth quarters of a calendar year.

Protiviti

has been in operation since May 2002.

Protiviti

is generally more active in the third and fourth quarters of a calendar year. Order backlog is not a material aspect of the Company’s staffing services business. While
backlog is of greater importance to

Protiviti

, the Company does not believe, based upon the length of time of the average

Protiviti

engagement, that backlog is a material aspect of the

Protiviti

business. No material portion of
the Company’s business is subject to government contracts.

Information about foreign operations is contained in Note M of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Company does not have export sales.

Available Information

such information on its website.


Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The Company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most important of these risks and
uncertainties are as follows:

Business Highly Dependent Upon the State of the Economy.

The demand for the
Company’s services, in particular its staffing services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company’s clients. Any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the U.S. or
of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the Company’s services and thereby
significantly decrease the Company’s revenues and profits.

Availability of Candidates.

The
Company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Candidates generally seek temporary
or regular positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.

Highly Competitive Business.

The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors,
some of which have greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company’s revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.

Reputation

.    The success of the Company’s staffing and

Protiviti

businesses is highly dependent
upon their reputations. Any event that adversely impacts the reputation of either business could materially adversely affect the Company.

Potential Liability to Employees and Clients.

The Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. The
Company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of
physical injury, discrimination or harassment. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material
adverse effect upon the Company. The Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees. The Company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims.
While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company
or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Company’s insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.

Dependence Upon Personnel.

The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly
dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnel
that are essential to its success.

Government Regulation.

The Company’s business is subject to
regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all
necessary licenses or


approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing
requirements could materially adversely affect the Company.

Government Regulation of the Workplace.

The
Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or
judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company.

Demand for
Services.

The operations of both the staffing services business and

Protiviti

include services related to Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory compliance. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand
for these services.

Reliance on Short-Term Contracts.

Because long-term contracts are not a significant part
of the Company’s staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results.

The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several class and representative action lawsuits alleging various wage and hour claims that could cause the Company to incur substantial
liabilities

.    The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the Company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal
and state law with respect to certain wage and hour matters. The Company and certain subsidiaries are currently defendants in four such lawsuits in California and one such lawsuit in Massachusetts. All five lawsuits allege, among other things, the
misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under federal and state law and other related wage and hour violations and seek an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime compensation, statutory penalties, and other damages, as well as
attorneys’ fees. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of
the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could,
individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

Protiviti Dependence on Personnel.

Protiviti is a services business, and is dependent upon its ability to attract and
retain personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so.

Protiviti Competition.

Protiviti

operates in a highly competitive business. As with the Company’s staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of
which have greater resources than

Protiviti

and many of which have been in operation far longer than

Protiviti

. In particular,

Protiviti

faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms, which have been in
operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of
skills of personnel, there can be no assurance that

Protiviti

will be successful in attracting and retaining clients.

Potential
Liability.

The business of

Protiviti

consists of providing internal audit and business and technology risk consulting services. Liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the Company or

Protiviti

for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on

Protiviti

or the Company.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments.

Not applicable.


Item 2.    Properties

The Company’s headquarters operations are located in Menlo Park and Pleasanton, California. As of December 31, 2006, placement activities were
conducted through more than 350 offices located in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Switzerland, Japan, China, Singapore, Australia
and New Zealand. As of December 31, 2006,

Protiviti

had more than 55 offices in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brasil, Australia, China, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, India and the United
Kingdom. All of the offices are leased.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

On September 10, 2004, Plaintiff Mark Laffitte, on behalf of himself and a putative class of salaried Account Executives and Staffing Managers, filed
a complaint in California Superior Court naming the Company and three of its wholly owned subsidiaries as Defendants. The complaint alleges that salaried Account Executives and Staffing Managers based in California have been misclassified under
California law as exempt employees and seeks an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime pay alleged to be due to them had they been paid as non-exempt hourly employees. In addition, the Plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount for statutory penalties
for alleged violations of the California Labor Code arising from the alleged misclassification of these employees as exempt employees. On June 22, 2006, the Court heard cross-motions concerning class certification. On September 18, 2006, the
Court issued an order certifying a class with respect to claims for alleged unpaid overtime pay but denied certification with respect to claims relating to meal periods and rest time breaks. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to
predict the outcome of or a range of loss, should a loss occur, from this proceeding, and accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial statements. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations, and
the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against the litigation.

On December 6, 2004, Plaintiffs Ian O’Donnell and
David Jolicoeur, on behalf of themselves and a putative class of salaried Staffing Managers, Account Executives and Account Managers, filed a complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court naming the Company and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries as
Defendants. The complaint alleges that salaried Staffing Managers, Account Executives and Account Managers based in Massachusetts within the past two years have been misclassified under Massachusetts law as exempt employees and seeks an unspecified
amount equal to three times their unpaid overtime compensation alleged to be due to them had they been paid as non-exempt, hourly employees, plus costs and legal fees. The complaint also makes similar allegations under the U.S. Fair Labor Standards
Act on behalf of all Staffing Managers, Account Executives and Account Managers employed in any state other than Massachusetts and California within the past three years and seeks an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime pay alleged to be due to
them had they been paid as non-exempt, hourly employees, plus an equal amount as liquidated damages. The case has been removed to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. On March 30, 2006, the Court denied
Plaintiffs’ first motion seeking conditional certification of their federal claims as a collective action on behalf of a group of Staffing Managers, Account Executives and Account Managers. The same day, the Court allowed Plaintiffs to amend
their complaint to add claims that the Company failed to pay its exempt employees on a “salary basis” as required by Massachusetts and federal law. Plaintiffs have also filed a second motion for conditional certification of their federal
claims in which they seek to represent a class of salaried employees who worked for the Company in any state other than California within three years before the original complaint was filed and seeking permission to mail class members a notice
regarding their right to opt into the case as Plaintiffs. The Company has opposed that motion, and the Court has not yet issued a ruling. Because the litigation is at an early stage, it is not feasible to predict its outcome or a range of loss,
should a loss occur. Accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial statements. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations, and the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against the
litigation.

On August 9, 2005, Plaintiff Lizette Greene, on behalf of herself and a putative class of salaried “inside sales
persons,” filed a complaint in United States District Court for the Northern District of California naming the


Company and three of its wholly owned subsidiaries as Defendants. On December 1, 2005, the Plaintiff amended the Complaint. The Amended Complaint
alleges that purported “inside sales persons” based in California have been misclassified under federal law as exempt employees and seeks an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime pay alleged to be due to them had they been paid as
non-exempt, hourly employees. In addition, the Plaintiff also makes two claims under the California Private Attorney Generals Act seeking an unspecified amount for statutory penalties for alleged violations of the California Labor Code arising from
the alleged misclassification of these employees as exempt employees. Plaintiff also makes a claim under California Business and Professions Code § 17200 for a putative nation wide class of purported “inside sales persons.”
On December 22, 2006, the Plaintiff filed a motion for conditional certification of their federal claims in which they seek to represent a class of salaried employees who worked for the Company and certain of its subsidiaries in California
within three years before the complaint was filed and seeking permission to mail class members a notice regarding their right to opt into the case as plaintiffs. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict the outcome of or a
range of loss, should a loss occur, from this proceeding, and accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial statements. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations, and the Company intends to
continue to vigorously defend against the litigation.

On March 28, 2006, Plaintiffs Maria Pellegrino, Nadia Balici, Carolyn Cox,
Kelli Maresch, Jennifer McCasland and James Rossetto, all former, salaried Account Executives based in California, filed a complaint in California Superior Court naming the Company and three of its wholly owned subsidiaries as Defendants. The
complaint alleges that Plaintiffs were misclassified under California law as exempt employees and seeks an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime pay alleged to be due to them had they been paid as non-exempt hourly employees. Plaintiffs also seek
an unspecified amount for statutory penalties for alleged violations of the California Labor Code arising from the alleged misclassification of the Plaintiff employees as exempt employees. In addition, Plaintiffs’ complaint includes a cause of
action for “unfair competition” under the California Business & Professions Code. Under this cause of action, Plaintiffs seek restitutionary damages of unpaid wages for themselves and “all similarly situated employees”
as well as recovery of Plaintiffs’ attorneys fees. The trial date is presently scheduled for June 4, 2007. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict the outcome of or a range of loss, should a loss occur, from this
proceeding, and accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial statements. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations, and the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against the
litigation.

On May 4, 2006, Plaintiff Don Tran, on behalf of himself and a putative class of salaried Consultants, and a sub-class of
terminated salaried Consultants, filed a complaint in California Superior Court naming Protiviti Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Protiviti”), as Defendant. The complaint alleges that salaried Consultants based in
California have been misclassified under California law as exempt employees and seeks an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime pay alleged to be due to them had they been paid as non-exempt, hourly employees. Plaintiff also seeks an unspecified
amount for statutory penalties for alleged violations of the California Labor Code arising from the alleged misclassification of these employees as exempt employees. The complaint further seeks damages and penalties for the failure to provide meal
and rest periods, and for the failure to reimburse business expenses, including, without limitation, parking and cellular telephone expenses. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict the outcome of or a range of loss, should a
loss occur, from this proceeding, and accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial statements. Protiviti believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations, and Protiviti intends to continue to vigorously defend
against the litigation.

The Company is involved in a number of other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. While management
does not expect any of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows, litigation is subject to certain inherent uncertainties.

common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions, bringing the total authorization since plan inception to 58,000,000 shares, of which 46,626,754 shares have been repurchased as of
December 31, 2006.


The remainder of the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to Part III, Item 12
of this Form 10-K.

Item 6.    Selected Financial Data

The selected five-year financial data presented below should be read in conjunction with the information contained in Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.


Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Certain information contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed
forward-looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the Company’s future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as “estimate”, “forecast”,
“project”, “plan”, “intend”, “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward-looking statements are subject to
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in levels of unemployment and other economic
conditions in the United States or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of candidates for temporary employment or the Company’s ability to attract candidates; the
entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the
impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the Company’s services, on the Company’s ability to maintain its margins; the possibility of the Company incurring liability for its activities, including the
activities of its temporary employees, or for events impacting its temporary employees on clients’ premises; the possibility that adverse publicity could impact the Company’s ability to attract and retain clients and candidates; the
success of the Company in attracting, training, and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; whether governments will impose additional regulations or licensing requirements on personnel services businesses in particular
or on employer/employee relationships in general; whether there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; and litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities, including litigation that may
be disclosed from time to time in the Company’s SEC filings. Additionally, with respect to Protiviti, other risks and uncertainties include the fact that future success will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract clients; there
can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; failure to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and there is the possibility of involvement in
litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities. Further information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” Because long-term contracts are not a significant part
of the Company’s business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

As described below, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and
estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments.

Accounts Receivable Allowances.

The
Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from (i) the inability of its customers to make required payments, (ii) temporary placement sales adjustments, and (iii) permanent placement candidates not remaining with the
client through the 90-day guarantee period, commonly referred to as “fall offs”. The Company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers’ credit profiles, historical loss statistics and current trends. The adequacy
of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period. Historically, the Company’s actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances. As a percentage of gross accounts receivable, the Company’s accounts receivable
allowances totaled 4.1% and 4.4% as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, a five-percentage point deviation in the Company’s accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or
decrease in the allowance of $1.1 million. Although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results, management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and
experience. However, if the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur,
additional allowances may be required.

Income Tax Assets and Liabilities.

In establishing its deferred
income tax assets and liabilities, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are


applicable to its operations. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates, which the Company expects will
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The likelihood of a material change in the Company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, its ability to
use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions.

The Company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. Management evaluates all positive
and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events, including operating results, to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized. When appropriate, a
valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. In relation to actual net operating losses in certain foreign operations, valuation allowances of $11.5 million were recorded as
of December 31, 2006. If such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income, the Company will benefit its deferred tax assets up to the full amount of the valuation reserve.

While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may
materially affect the future financial results of the Company.

Employee Retirement Plans

.    For the year ended
December 31, 2005 the determination of the Company’s obligations for its defined benefit retirement agreement for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer was dependent upon the following assumptions: expected retirement age, mortality,
expected post-retirement Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) increases, and discount rates. These assumptions were evaluated and updated each reporting period. A historical long-term average rate was used for CPI, while a current long term market
rate was used for the discount rate. As of December 31, 2005 the CPI rate used in calculating the liability was 2.8%. The discount rate used in calculating this liability as of December 31, 2005 was 4.0%.

Effective October 1, 2006 the Key Executive Retirement Plan (the “Retirement Agreement”) and the Company’s Deferred Compensation Plan
(the “DCP”) were amended. Future benefit accruals under the Retirement Agreement were frozen and converted from a traditional defined benefit plan into a deferred compensation arrangement within the DCP with market rate interest amounts
credited in the future on the converted amount. The balance in the Retirement Agreement as of October 1, 2006 of $49 million, calculated by the Company and its independent actuarial advisors, was transferred to the DCP. As of December 31, 2006,
employee benefit and retirement obligations included $53 million for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer for the DCP and other benefits.

Goodwill Impairment.

The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment assessments for goodwill are done at a reporting unit level. For purposes of this assessment, the Company’s reporting units are its lines of business. In performing periodic impairment tests, the fair value of the reporting unit is
compared to the carrying value, including goodwill and intangible assets. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, however, an impairment condition exists.

The goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimate of future cash flows is based upon, among other things, a
discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance. The discount rate used by management has been calculated on a consistent basis and has not fluctuated significantly. The primary assumptions related to future
operating performance include revenue growth rates and expense levels. These assumptions are updated annually and are primarily based upon historical trends. Although management does not anticipate that these assumptions will change materially in
the future, the Company’s estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance. The Company completed its
annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. Based upon the Company’s


most recent goodwill impairment analysis, management believes that unless a reporting unit were to be abandoned, the possibility of goodwill impairment as a
result of a change in assumptions is unlikely.

Workers’ Compensation

.    Except for states which require
participation in state-operated insurance funds, the Company retains the economic burden for the first $0.5 million per occurrence in workers’ compensation claims. Workers’ compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage
for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Claims in excess of $0.5 million are insured. Workers’ compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of $0.5 million, claims administration
fees charged by the Company’s workers’ compensation administrator, premiums paid to state-operated insurance funds, and an estimate for the Company’s liability for Incurred But Not Reported (“IBNR”) claims and for the
ongoing development of existing claims. Total workers’ compensation expense was $12.4 million and $11.4 million, representing 0.39% and 0.42% of applicable U.S. revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The accrual for IBNR claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period includes estimates. The Company
has established reserves for workers’ compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the Company’s historical
frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. While management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in
assumptions may materially affect the Company’s future results. Based on the Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2006, a five-percentage point deviation in the Company’s estimated loss development rates would have
resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of $0.5 million.

Stock-based Compensation

.    Under
various stock plans, officers, employees, and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock, stock units, stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123(R)”), using the modified prospective transition method; accordingly, prior
periods have not been restated. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements (“Financial Statements”) for the year ended December 31, 2006 included compensation expense for stock
options, which includes grants made prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, as well as stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2006.

Beginning in 2005, the Company significantly decreased its use of stock options as part of its compensation programs. For the year ended
December 31, 2006, the Company’s pre-tax stock-based compensation cost from options totaled $17.6 million. Under both SFAS No. 123 (“SFAS 123”),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

and SFAS 123(R) the Company
determined the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model.

SFAS 123(R) requires the Company to recognize
compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest, rather than record forfeitures when they occur, as previously permitted. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by
management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was $40.8 million, of which $10.2 million
was related to grants made in 2006. A one-percentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a $0.4 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for the year
ended December 31, 2006.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
Instruments—An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140

(“SFAS 155”).


SFAS 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole (eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from
its host) if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. This statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after
September 15, 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on its Financial Statements.

In
March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,

Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets—An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140

(“SFAS 156”). SFAS 156 provides some relief for entities that use derivatives to
economically hedge fluctuations in the fair value of their servicing rights and changes how gains and losses are computed in certain transfers or securitizations. SFAS 156 is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after
September 15, 2006. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s Financial Statements.

In June 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 06-3,

How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross
Versus Net Presentation)

. This standard allows companies to present in their statements of operations any taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on revenue-producing transactions between a seller and a customer,
such as sales, use, value-added and some excise taxes, on either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net (excluded from revenues) basis. This standard will be effective for the Company in interim periods and fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006. The Company presents these transactions on a net basis and intends to continue this presentation in the future, therefore the adoption of this standard will have no impact on its Financial Statements.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48

, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects
to take on a tax return. The Company does not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on its Financial Statements.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157
does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is
permitted, provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including for interim periods, for that fiscal year. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on its Financial Statements.

In September 2006, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 06-4,

Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement
Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements

(“EITF 06-4”). EITF 06-4 indicates that an employer should recognize a liability for future post-employment benefits based on the substantive agreement with the employee, and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. The Company will adopt EITF 06-4 as required and does not expect a material impact on its Financial Statements.

In September 2006, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue 06-5,

Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance-Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin

No. 85-4

(“EITF 06-5”). EITF 06-5 requires that a policyholder should consider any additional amounts included in the contractual terms of the policy in determining the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract
on a policy by policy basis. EITF 06-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and it requires that recognition of the effects of adoption should be either by (a) a change in accounting principle through a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or (b) a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 06-5
to have a material impact on its Financial Statements.


Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2006

Temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were $3.1 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively, increasing by 19% and 21% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Permanent placement revenues were $336 million, $219 million and $136 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, increasing by 53%
and 61% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Improvement in the U.S. labor markets contributed to the increase in temporary and permanent staffing services revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Risk consulting and internal audit
services revenues were $543 million, $479 million and $352 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, increasing by 13% and 36% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2006 increase in risk consulting and internal
audit services revenues is primarily due to higher international revenues, particularly in Asia. The 2005 increase in risk consulting and internal audit services revenues is primarily due to increased brand acceptance in the marketplace and
expanding demand related to increased focus on internal accounting controls and other corporate governance requirements, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. There can be no assurances that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley or
other regulatory compliance services, or that future results can be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. We expect total Company revenues to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2007.

The Company’s temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 350 offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and
17 foreign countries, while Protiviti has more than 55 offices in 22 states and 14 foreign countries. Revenues from foreign operations represented 21%, 19% and 18% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Gross margin dollars from the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services,
which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees. Gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services are equal to revenues, as there are no direct costs associated with such revenues. Gross margin
dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, insurance costs and reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the
Company’s temporary and consultant staffing services were $1.2 billion, $963 million and $787 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, increasing by 20% and 22% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross
margin amounts equaled 37%, 36% and 36% of revenues for temporary and consultant staffing services for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The higher 2006 temporary and consultant gross margin percentage is primarily
the result of higher bill rates and conversion revenues. Conversion revenues are earned when a temporary position converts to a permanent position. As there are no direct costs related to conversion revenues, the gross margin percentage is favorably
impacted as the mix of conversion revenues increases. In the year ended December 31, 2006, the composition of temporary revenues included higher conversion revenues as compared to 2005.

Gross margin dollars for the Company’s permanent placement staffing division were $336 million, $219 million and $136 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, increasing by 53% and 61% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross margin dollars for the Company’s risk consulting and internal audit division were $199 million, $190 million and
$133 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, increasing by 5% and 43% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross margin amounts equaled 37%, 40% and 38% of revenues for risk consulting and internal audit
services for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily the result of additional professional staff related to the expansion of international operations as well as
lower utilization of the professional staff in the United States. The 2005 improvement in risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin dollars is primarily the result of higher revenues and improved staff utilization.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.2 billion in 2006, compared to $991 million in 2005 and $824 million in 2004. Selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 31%, 30% and 31% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Selling, general and


administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. The expensing of stock options, the higher
mix of permanent placement activities, and the continuing additions to professional staff all contributed to the higher percentage of 2006 selling, general and administrative expenses. The lower 2005 selling, general and administrative expense
percentage resulted primarily from leveraging fixed operating costs.

For acquisitions, the Company allocates the excess of cost over the
fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets, if any, and then to goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their lives, typically ranging from two to five years. Goodwill is not amortized,
but is tested at least annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was
required. Net intangible assets, consisting primarily of goodwill, represented 12% of total assets and 17% of total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2006.

Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $19.3 million, $12.1 million and $5.0 million, respectively, while interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004 was $2.5 million, $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Higher average cash balances in 2006 and 2005 and higher interest rates during those years yielded higher interest income.

The provision for income taxes was 39%, 39% and 40% of income before taxes for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
decrease in 2005 is due primarily to the diminishing impact of permanent non-deductible tax items, which became increasingly less significant relative to the Company’s improved financial results, and to the utilization of net operating loss
carryforwards in certain states and international locations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The change in the Company’s liquidity during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is primarily the net effect of funds generated by
operations and the funds used for capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends and principal payments on outstanding notes payable.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $447 million, $458 million and $437 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating activities provided $376 million during the year
ended December 31, 2006, partially offset by $96 million and $299 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Operating activities and investing activities provided $328 million and $22 million,
respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2005, partially offset by $232 million of net cash used in financing activities. Operating activities provided $162 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, partially offset by $37
million and $76 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively.

Operating activities—Net
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was composed of net income of $283 million adjusted for non-cash items of $58 million, and net cash provided by changes in working capital of $35 million. Net cash
provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was composed of net income of $238 million adjusted for non-cash items of $122 million, and net cash used for changes in working capital of $32 million. Net cash
provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was composed of net income of $141 million adjusted for non-cash items of $93 million, and net cash used for changes in working capital of $72 million.

Investing activities—Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $96 million. This was primarily composed
of capital expenditures of $80 million, purchases of goodwill and other intangible assets of $12 million, and deposits to trusts for employee benefits and retirement plans of $4 million. Cash provided by investing activities for the year
ended December 31, 2005 was $22 million. This


was primarily composed of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $92 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $62
million, purchases of goodwill and other intangible assets of $4 million, and deposits to trusts for employee benefits and retirement plans of $3 million. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was
$37 million. This was primarily composed of capital expenditures of $33 million.

Financing activities—Cash used in
financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $299 million. This included repurchases of $400 million in common stock and $54 million in cash dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $105 million from
exercises of stock options and the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $50 million. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $232 million. This included repurchases of $262 million in
common stock and $48 million in cash dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $77 million from exercises of stock options. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $76 million. This
included common stock repurchases of $90 million and cash dividends to stockholders of $31 million, partially offset by proceeds of $44 million from exercises of stock options.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time to time, up to 11.4 million additional shares of the Company’s
common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 7.9 million, 7.6 million and
2.7 million shares of common stock on the open market for a total cost of $273 million, $222 million and $64 million, respectively. Additional stock repurchases were made in connection with employee stock plans, whereby Company shares were
tendered by employees for the payment of exercise price and applicable statutory withholding taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, such repurchases totaled approximately 3.3 million, 1.6 million and
1.0 million shares at a cost of $127 million, $53 million and $25 million, respectively. Repurchases of securities have been funded with cash generated from operations.

The Company’s working capital at December 31, 2006 included $447 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s working capital
requirements relate primarily to accounts receivable. While there can be no assurances in this regard, the Company expects that internally generated cash will be sufficient to support the working capital needs of the Company, the Company’s
fixed payments, dividends, and other obligations on both a short- and long-term basis.

On February 13, 2007, the Company announced a
quarterly dividend of $.10 per share to be paid to all shareholders of record on February 26, 2007. The dividend will be paid on March 15, 2007.

The Company’s cash flows generated from operations are also the primary source for funding various contractual obligations. The table below summarizes the Company’s major commitments as of December 31,
2006 (in thousands):

Long-term debt obligations consist of promissory notes and related interest as well as other forms
of indebtedness issued in connection with certain acquisitions and other payment obligations. Operating lease obligations consist of minimum rental commitments for 2007 and thereafter under non-cancelable leases in effect at December 31, 2006.
Purchase obligations consist of purchase commitments primarily related to telecom service agreements, software licenses and subscriptions, and computer hardware and software maintenance agreements.


Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to
the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s reported earnings, investments in its foreign subsidiaries, and the intercompany transactions with its foreign subsidiaries.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 21% of the Company’s revenues were generated outside of the United States. These operations
transact business in their functional currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar have an impact on the Company’s reported results. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Consequently, as the value of the U.S. dollar changes relative to the currencies of the Company’s non-U.S. markets, the Company’s reported
results vary.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar amount of the Company’s stockholders’ equity. The
assets and liabilities of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income.

Protiviti

Protiviti

, which primarily employs risk consulting and internal audit professionals formerly associated with major accounting firms, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Revenues are
predominantly derived from specialized staffing services. The Company operates in the North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The Company is a Delaware corporation.

Basis of Presentation.

The Consolidated Financial Statements (“Financial Statements”) of the Company are prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Principles of Consolidation.

The Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of
which are wholly-owned. All intercompany balances have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. As of December 31, 2006, such estimates included allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, workers’ compensation losses and income and other taxes.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company derives its revenues from three segments: temporary and consultant
staffing, permanent placement staffing, and risk consulting and internal audit services. Net service revenues as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations represent services rendered to customers less sales adjustments and allowances.
The Company records revenue on a gross basis as a principal versus on a net basis as an agent in the presentation of revenues and expenses. The Company has concluded that gross reporting is appropriate because the Company (i) has the risk of
identifying and hiring qualified employees, (ii) has the discretion to select the employees and establish their price and duties and (iii) bears the risk for services that are not fully paid for by customers.

Temporary and consultant staffing revenues—Temporary and consultant staffing revenues are recognized when the services are rendered by the
Company’s temporary employees. Temporary employees placed by the Company are the Company’s legal employees while they are working on assignments. The Company pays all related costs of employment, including workers’ compensation
insurance, state and federal unemployment taxes, social security and certain fringe benefits. The Company assumes the risk of acceptability of its employees to its customers.

Permanent placement staffing revenues—Permanent placement staffing revenues are recognized when employment candidates accept offers of permanent
employment. The Company has a substantial history of estimating the effect of permanent placement candidates who do not remain with its clients through the 90-day guarantee period. Allowances are established to estimate these losses. Fees to clients
are generally calculated as a percentage of the new employee’s annual compensation. No fees for permanent placement services are charged to employment candidates.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note A—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Risk consulting and internal audit revenues—Risk consulting and internal audit services are
generally provided on a time-and-material basis or fixed-fee basis. Revenues earned under time-and-material arrangements are recognized as services are provided. Revenues on fixed-fee arrangements are recognized using a proportional performance
method as hours are incurred relative to total estimated hours for the engagement. The Company periodically evaluates the need to provide for any losses on these projects, and losses are recognized when it is probable that a loss will be incurred.
Reimbursements, including those relating to travel and out-of-pocket expenses, are included in risk consulting and internal audit service revenues, and equivalent amounts of reimbursable expenses are included in direct costs of services.

Costs of Services.

Direct costs of staffing services consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance costs for the
Company’s temporary employees. There are no direct costs associated with permanent placement staffing services. Risk consulting and internal audit costs of services include professional staff payroll, payroll taxes and insurance costs, as well
as reimbursable expenses.

Advertising Costs.

The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred.

Comprehensive Income.

Comprehensive income includes net income and certain other items that are recorded directly to Stockholders’ Equity.
The Company’s only source of other comprehensive income is foreign currency translation adjustments.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents.

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

.    Intangible assets primarily consist of the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair
market value of their net tangible assets at the date of acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their lives, typically ranging from two to five years. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment.
The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the three years ended December 31, 2006, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.

Income Tax Assets and Liabilities

.    In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the Company makes
judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates, which the Company expects
will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The likelihood of a material change in the Company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, its
ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions.

Workers’ Compensation

.    Except for states which require participation in state-operate insurance funds, the Company
retains the economic burden for the first $0.5 million per occurrence in workers’ compensation claims. Workers’ compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the
date of injury. Claims in excess of $0.5 million are insured. Workers’ compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of $0.5 million, claims administration fees charged by the Company’s workers’
compensation administrator, premiums paid to state-operated insurance funds, and an estimate for the Company’s liability for Incurred But Not Reported (“IBNR”) claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note A—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The accrual for IBNR claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting
period includes estimates. The Company has established reserves for workers’ compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which
include the Company’s historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. While management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate, significant differences in actual
experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Company’s future results.

Foreign Currency
Translation.

The results of operations of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The financial position of the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries is translated at the current exchange rates at the end of the period, and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders’ Equity. Gains and losses
resulting from foreign currency transactions are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and have not been material for all periods presented.

Stock-based Compensation

.    Under various stock plans, officers, employees, and outside directors have received or may
receive grants of restricted stock, stock units, stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123(R)”). Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for the plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”), and related Interpretations as permitted by SFAS No. 123 (“SFAS 123”),

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.

Under
APB 25, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and stock units in its Financial Statements. Under the provisions of APB 25, the Company was not required to recognize compensation expense for stock options due to
using the intrinsic value method. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options was included as a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes.

The following table reflects pro forma net income and basic and diluted net income per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note A—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The fair value of each option is estimated, as of the grant date, using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 2005 and 2004: expected dividend yields of 0.92% and 0.85% for grants in 2005 and 2004, respectively; expected volatility of 47.1% and 49.4% for 2005 and 2004,
respectively; risk-free interest rates of 3.8% and 3.6% for 2005 and 2004, respectively; and expected lives of 6.1 years and 6.0 years for 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, the Company’s Financial Statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not
include, the impact of SFAS 123(R). Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Company’s Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included compensation expense for stock options, which includes grants made prior
to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, as well as stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2006. The effect of applying SFAS 123(R) is outlined in the following table (in thousands, except per share amounts):

See Note K—Stock Plans for further information.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is computed using the
straight-line method over the following useful lives:

Computer hardware

2 to 3 years

Computer software

2 to 5 years

Furniture and equipment

5 years

Leasehold improvements

Term of lease, 5 years maximum

Internal-use Software.

The Company capitalizes direct costs incurred
in the development of internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are reported as a component of computer software within property and equipment. The Company capitalized approximately $8.3 million, $4.5 million and $5.1 million of internal-use
software development costs for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Note B—New Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments—An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140

(“SFAS 155”). SFAS 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole (eliminating the need to bifurcate
the derivative from its host) if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. This statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that
begins after September 15, 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on its Financial Statements.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,

Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets—An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140

(“SFAS 156”). SFAS 156 provides some relief for entities that use


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note B—New Accounting Pronouncements (Continued)

derivatives to economically hedge fluctuations in the fair value of their servicing rights and changes how gains and losses are computed in certain transfers
or securitizations. SFAS 156 is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s Financial Statements.

In June 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 06-3,

How Taxes Collected from Customers
and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation)

. This standard allows companies to present in their statements of operations any taxes assessed by a governmental
authority that are directly imposed on revenue-producing transactions between a seller and a customer, such as sales, use, value-added and some excise taxes, on either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net (excluded from revenues) basis.
This standard will be effective for the Company in interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company presents these transactions on a net basis and intends to continue this presentation in the future, therefore the
adoption of this standard will have no impact on its Financial Statements.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No. 48

, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and
disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The Company does not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on its Financial Statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value, establishes
guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting
pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including for interim periods, for that fiscal year. The
Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on its Financial Statements.

In September 2006, the FASB
ratified EITF Issue No. 06-4,

Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements

(“EITF 06-4”). EITF 06-4 indicates that an employer should recognize
a liability for future post-employment benefits based on the substantive agreement with the employee, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. The Company will adopt EITF 06-4 as required and does not expect a
material impact on its Financial Statements.

In September 2006, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue 06-5,

Accounting for
Purchases of Life Insurance-Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85-4

(“EITF 06-5”). EITF 06-5 requires that a policyholder should consider any additional amounts included in
the contractual terms of the policy in determining the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract on a policy by policy basis. EITF 06-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and it requires that
recognition of the effects of adoption should be either by (a) a change in accounting principle through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or (b) a change in accounting principle
through retrospective application to all prior periods. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 06-5 to have a material impact on its Financial Statements.

Note F—Accrued Payroll Costs and Retirement Obligations

Accrued payroll costs and retirement obligations consisted of the following (in thousands):

Included in employee benefits and retirement obligations is $42 million at December 31, 2005
related to a defined benefit retirement agreement for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The amount of this obligation was calculated in accordance with the provisions of the employee’s Retirement Agreement (the “Retirement
Agreement”), which was initially entered into in 1985 and was in effect as of December 31, 2005. The key assumptions used in the calculation include: expected retirement age, mortality, expected post-retirement Consumer Price Index
increase of 3.5% and discount rate of 4.0% at December 31, 2005. Effective October 1, 2006 the Retirement Agreement and the Company’s Deferred Compensation Plan (the “DCP”) were amended. Future benefit accruals under the
Retirement Agreement were frozen and converted from a traditional defined benefit plan into a deferred compensation arrangement within the DCP with market rate interest amounts credited in the future on the converted amount. Therefore, the use of
estimates no longer applies for the Retirement Agreement. Included in employee benefits and retirement obligations at December 31, 2006 is $53 million related to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer for the DCP and other benefits.

Note G—Notes Payable and Other Indebtedness

The Company issued promissory notes as well as other forms of indebtedness in connection with certain acquisitions and other payment obligations. These are due in varying installments, carry varying interest rates
and, in aggregate, amounted to $4.2 million at December 31, 2006 and $3.1 million at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, $2.1 million of the notes were collateralized by a standby letter of credit. The following table shows the
schedule of maturities for notes payable and other indebtedness at December 31, 2006 (in thousands):

At December 31, 2006, the notes carried fixed rates and the weighted average interest rate
for the above was approximately 6.9%, 8.7% and 8.7% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company
has an uncommitted letter of credit facility (“the facility”) of up to $35.0 million, which is available to cover the issuance of debt support standby letters of credit. The Company had used $27.0 million in debt support standby letters of
credit as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. Of the debt support standby letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, $24.8 million satisfies workers’ compensation insurer’s collateral requirements. There is a
service fee of 1.0% on the used portion of the facility. The facility is subject to certain financial covenants and expires on August 31, 2007.

The deferred income tax amounts included on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position are
comprised of the following (in thousands):

The components of the deferred income tax amounts at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as
follows (in thousands):

The Company has net operating loss carryforwards in a number of states. The tax benefit of these
net operating losses is $4.3 million. These state net operating losses expire in 2007 and later. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards in foreign countries. The tax benefit of these net operating losses is $11.5 million. These net
operating losses expire in 2007 and later.

The Company has not provided deferred income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on $7.0 million
and $13.9 million of undistributed earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 respectively, since the Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely. Foreign tax credits associated with these earnings are
expected to offset any U.S. tax liability which would arise upon repatriation.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note I—Commitments and Contingencies

Rental expense, primarily for office premises, amounted to $83.4 million, $75.6 million and $74.6
million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The approximate minimum rental commitments for 2007 and thereafter under non-cancelable leases in effect at December 31, 2006 were as follows (in thousands):

Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, the Company had future purchase commitments of
approximately $35.3 million over the next three years primarily related to telecom service agreements, software licenses and subscriptions, and computer hardware and software maintenance agreements.

On September 10, 2004, Plaintiff Mark Laffitte, on behalf of himself and a putative class of salaried Account Executives and Staffing Managers,
filed a complaint in California Superior Court naming the Company and three of its wholly owned subsidiaries as Defendants. The complaint alleges that salaried Account Executives and Staffing Managers based in California have been misclassified
under California law as exempt employees and seeks an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime pay alleged to be due to them had they been paid as non-exempt hourly employees. In addition, the Plaintiff seeks an unspecified amount for statutory
penalties for alleged violations of the California Labor Code arising from the alleged misclassification of these employees as exempt employees. On June 22, 2006, the Court heard cross-motions concerning class certification. On
September 18, 2006, the Court issued an order certifying a class with respect to claims for alleged unpaid overtime pay but denied certification with respect to claims relating to meal periods and rest time breaks. At this stage of the
litigation, it is not feasible to predict the outcome of or a range of loss, should a loss occur, from this proceeding, and accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial statements. The Company believes it has meritorious
defenses to the allegations, and the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against the litigation.

On December 6, 2004,
Plaintiffs Ian O’Donnell and David Jolicoeur, on behalf of themselves and a putative class of salaried Staffing Managers, Account Executives and Account Managers, filed a complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court naming the Company and one of
its wholly owned subsidiaries as Defendants. The complaint alleges that salaried Staffing Managers, Account Executives and Account Managers based in Massachusetts within the past two years have been misclassified under Massachusetts law as exempt
employees and seeks an unspecified amount equal to three times their unpaid overtime compensation alleged to be due to them had they been paid as non-exempt, hourly employees, plus costs and legal fees. The complaint also makes similar allegations
under the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act on behalf of all Staffing Managers, Account Executives and Account Managers employed in any state other than Massachusetts and California within the past three years and seeks an unspecified amount for unpaid
overtime pay alleged to be due to them had they been paid as non-exempt, hourly employees, plus an equal amount as liquidated damages. The case has been removed to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. On March 30,
2006, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ first motion seeking conditional certification of their federal claims as a collective action on behalf of a group of Staffing Managers, Account Executives and Account Managers. The same day, the Court allowed
Plaintiffs to amend their complaint to add claims that the Company failed to pay its exempt employees on a


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Note I—Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

“salary basis” as required by Massachusetts and federal law. Plaintiffs have also filed a second motion for conditional certification of their
federal claims in which they seek to represent a class of salaried employees who worked for the Company in any state other than California within three years before the original complaint was filed and seeking permission to mail class members a
notice regarding their right to opt into the case as Plaintiffs. The Company has opposed that motion, and the Court has not yet issued a ruling. Because the litigation is at an early stage, it is not feasible to predict its outcome or a range of
loss, should a loss occur. Accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial statements. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations, and the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against the
litigation.

On August 9, 2005, Plaintiff Lizette Greene, on behalf of herself and a putative class of salaried “inside sales
persons,” filed a complaint in United States District Court for the Northern District of California naming the Company and three of its wholly owned subsidiaries as Defendants. On December 1, 2005, the Plaintiff amended the Complaint. The
Amended Complaint alleges that purported “inside sales persons” based in California have been misclassified under federal law as exempt employees and seeks an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime pay alleged to be due to them had they
been paid as non-exempt, hourly employees. In addition, the Plaintiff also makes two claims under the California Private Attorney Generals Act seeking an unspecified amount for statutory penalties for alleged violations of the California Labor Code
arising from the alleged misclassification of these employees as exempt employees. Plaintiff also makes a claim under California Business and Professions Code § 17200 for a putative nation wide class of purported “inside sales
persons.” On December 22, 2006, the Plaintiff filed a motion for conditional certification of their federal claims in which they seek to represent a class of salaried employees who worked for the Company and certain of its subsidiaries in
California within three years before the complaint was filed and seeking permission to mail class members a notice regarding their right to opt into the case as plaintiffs. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict the outcome
of or a range of loss, should a loss occur, from this proceeding, and accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial statements. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations, and the Company intends
to continue to vigorously defend against the litigation.

On March 28, 2006, Plaintiffs Maria Pellegrino, Nadia Balici, Carolyn Cox,
Kelli Maresch, Jennifer McCasland and James Rossetto, all former, salaried Account Executives based in California, filed a complaint in California Superior Court naming the Company and three of its wholly owned subsidiaries as Defendants. The
complaint alleges that Plaintiffs were misclassified under California law as exempt employees and seeks an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime pay alleged to be due to them had they been paid as non-exempt hourly employees. Plaintiffs also seek
an unspecified amount for statutory penalties for alleged violations of the California Labor Code arising from the alleged misclassification of the Plaintiff employees as exempt employees. In addition, Plaintiffs’ complaint includes a cause of
action for “unfair competition” under the California Business & Professions Code. Under this cause of action, Plaintiffs seek restitutionary damages of unpaid wages for themselves and “all similarly situated employees”
as well as recovery of Plaintiffs’ attorneys fees. The trial date is presently scheduled for June 4, 2007. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict the outcome of or a range of loss, should a loss occur, from this
proceeding, and accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial statements. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations, and the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend against the
litigation.

On May 4, 2006, Plaintiff Don Tran, on behalf of himself and a putative class of salaried Consultants, and a sub-class of
terminated salaried Consultants, filed a complaint in California Superior Court naming Protiviti Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Protiviti”), as Defendant. The complaint alleges that salaried consultants based in
California have been misclassified under California law as exempt employees and seeks an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime pay alleged to be due to them had they been paid as non-exempt, hourly employees. Plaintiff also seeks an unspecified
amount for statutory penalties for alleged violations of the California Labor Code arising from the alleged misclassification of these employees as exempt employees. The complaint further seeks damages and penalties for the failure to provide meal
and rest periods, and for the failure to reimburse

business expenses, including, without limitation, parking and cellular telephone expenses. At this stage of the litigation, it is not feasible to predict the
outcome of or a range of loss, should a loss occur, from this proceeding, and accordingly, no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial statements. Protiviti believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations, and Protiviti
intends to continue to vigorously defend against the litigation.

The Company is involved in a number of other lawsuits arising in the
ordinary course of business. While management does not expect any of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows, litigation is subject to certain inherent
uncertainties.

Note J—Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Repurchase Program.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time to time, up to 11.4 million additional shares of the Company’s common
stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 7.9 million, 7.6 million and
2.7 million shares of common stock on the open market for a total cost of $273 million, $222 million and $64 million, respectively. Additional stock repurchases were made in connection with employee stock plans, whereby Company shares were
tendered by employees for the payment of exercise price and applicable statutory withholding taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, such repurchases totaled approximately 3.3 million, 1.6 million and
1.0 million shares at a cost of $127 million, $53 million and $25 million, respectively. Repurchases of securities have been funded with cash generated from operations.

Repurchases of shares are applied first to the extent of retained earnings and any remaining amounts are applied to capital surplus. As a result, the
Company had no retained earnings as of December 31, 2006.

The repurchased shares are held in treasury and are presented as if
constructively retired. Treasury stock is accounted for using the cost method. Treasury stock activity for each of the three years ended December 31, 2006 (consisting of stock option exercises and the purchase of shares for the treasury) is
presented in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.

Note K—Stock Plans

Under various stock plans, officers, employees, and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock, stock units, stock
appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock. Grants have been made at the discretion of the Committees of the Board of Directors. Grants generally vest over four years. Shares offered under the plan are authorized but unissued shares or
treasury shares.

Options currently outstanding under the plans have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s
common stock at the date of grant and consist of non-statutory stock options under the Internal Revenue Code, and generally have a term of 10 years.

Recipients of restricted stock do not pay any cash consideration to the Company for the shares, have the right to vote all shares subject to such grant, and receive all dividends with respect to such shares, whether
or not the shares have vested. Recipients of stock units do not pay any cash consideration for the units, do not have the right to vote, and do not receive dividends with respect to such units. Compensation expense for restricted stock and stock
units is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the stock’s fair market value on the grant date.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method; accordingly, prior periods have not been restated. Stock-based compensation expense
recognized in the Company’s Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2006

included compensation expense for stock options, which includes grants made prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, as well as stock
options granted during the year ended December 31, 2006.

SFAS 123(R) requires that excess tax benefits be recognized as an addition
to capital surplus and that unrealized tax benefits be recognized as income tax expense unless there are excess tax benefits from previous equity awards to which it can be offset. The Company calculated the amount of eligible excess tax benefits
that are available on the adoption date to offset future tax shortfalls in accordance with the long-form method described in paragraph 81 of SFAS 123(R).

Under both SFAS 123 and SFAS 123(R), the Company determines the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Under SFAS 123, the Company estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123(R) requires the Company
to recognize expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest and record adjustments to compensation expense at the end of the service period if actual forfeitures differ from original estimates.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company granted stock options on 0.2 million shares. The assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes
valuation model for these stock options included expected dividend yield of .99%, expected volatility of 38.5%, risk-free interest rate of 4.9% and an expected life of 4.7 years.

For purposes of calculating stock-based compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees, the service period is assumed to be met on the grant date
or retirement-eligible date, whichever is later.

SFAS 123(R) requires the Company to recognize compensation expense for only the portion
of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest, rather than record forfeitures when they occur, as previously permitted. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to
compensation expense may be required in future periods.

SFAS 123(R) requires the cumulative effect of recognizing compensation expense to
be recorded using estimated forfeitures rather than recording actual forfeitures as they occur. Upon adoption, the Company reviewed the cumulative effect of this change in accounting policy and determined it was not necessary to record a cumulative
adjustment as the impact was immaterial.

Prior to January 1, 2006, the measurement date for employee performance-based grants was the
date the performance criteria was met. As a result of adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company no longer has employee stock awards subject to variable accounting treatment. Accordingly, compensation cost for all employee restricted stock and stock units
is based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the date of grant and is recognized over the service period.

SFAS 123(R)
no longer requires the recognition of deferred compensation upon grant of restricted stock. On January 1, 2006, deferred compensation related to awards issued prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) was reduced to zero with a corresponding
decrease to capital surplus. In addition, SFAS 123(R) requires the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its Financial Statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the
Company’s future reported cash flows from operating activities.

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options recognized
under SFAS 123(R) for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $17.6 million. As of December 31, 2006, total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, was $13.1 million related to stock options and
$78.9 million related to restricted stock and stock units. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the next 4 years. There was no stock-based compensation expense related to stock options recognized during the year
ended December 31, 2005.

The following table reflects activity under all stock plans from December 31, 2003 through
December 31, 2006, and the weighted average exercise prices (in thousands, except per share amounts):

The total pre-tax intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $150.9 million, $108.6 million and $50.6 million, respectively. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $42.8 million, $28.7 million and $25.5
million, respectively.

The following table summarizes information about options outstanding as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands,
except number of years and per share amounts):

Note K—Stock Plans (Continued)

The aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value,
based on the Company’s closing stock price of $37.12 as of December 31, 2006, which would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date.

At December 31, 2006, the total number of available shares to grant under the plans (consisting of either restricted stock, stock units, stock
appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock) was approximately 6.4 million. Of the 14.2 million options outstanding at December 31, 2006, 12.3 million options were exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of
$19.53, and 1.9 million options were not exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $25.39.

Note L—Net Income Per Share

The calculation of net income per share for the three years ended December 31, 2006 is reflected in the following table (in
thousands, except per share amounts):

The weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004 excludes the dilutive effect of approximately 0.2 million, 0.1 million and 0.9 million options, restricted stock and stock units, respectively. Employee stock options will have a dilutive effect under the treasury method
only when the respective period’s average market value of the Company’s common stock exceeds the exercise proceeds. Under the treasury method, exercise proceeds include the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the
amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded in capital surplus, if the options were exercised and the restricted stock and stock units had vested. The
computation of potentially dilutive shares also included unvested restricted stock and stock units.

Note M—Business Segments

The Company, which aggregates its operating segments based on the nature of services, has three reportable segments: temporary and consultant staffing,
permanent placement staffing, and risk consulting and internal audit services. The temporary and consultant segment provides specialized staffing in the accounting and finance, administrative and office, information technology, legal, advertising,
marketing and web design fields. The permanent placement segment provides full-time personnel in the accounting, finance, administrative and office, and information technology fields. The risk consulting segment provides business and technology risk
consulting and internal audit services.

The accounting policies of the segments are set forth in Note A—Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies. The Company evaluates performance based on income or loss from operations before interest income, intangible amortization expense, and income taxes.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of Robert Half International Inc.:

We have completed
integrated audits of Robert Half International Inc.’s consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15, present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Robert Half International Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15 presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in 2006.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.


A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Item
9A.    Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Management,
including the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting.

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that
occurred during the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

.    Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006 using criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and concluded that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
