ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

    OVERVIEW

    Robert  Half  International Inc.  (the  "Company"), a  Delaware corporation,
primarily  operates  the   nation's  largest   staffing  services   organization
specializing  in the accounting, financial, tax  and banking fields. The Company
operates through  offices in  the  United States,  Canada, the  United  Kingdom,
Belgium  and France, offering  permanent and temporary  personnel services under
the names ROBERT HALF-R-and ACCOUNTEMPS-R-, respectively. Currently, the Company
operates 153 offices  and an additional  7 offices are  operated by  independent
franchisees.   The  Company  also  places  high-end  office  and  administrative
professionals (under the name OFFICETEAM-R-).

    ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL, TAX AND BANKING SERVICES

    The Company provides  skilled personnel  to virtually all  industries for  a
wide range of accounting, financial, tax, banking and data processing positions.
The  Company's  office network  maintains an  interoffice referral  system which
enables the  offices  to  cooperate  in  fulfilling  a  client's  permanent  and
temporary  employment requirements. The ROBERT HALF permanent placement services
complement the ACCOUNTEMPS  temporary staffing services  by providing  customers
the ability to obtain both temporary and permanent employees from one source and
by attracting applicants for permanent positions who are often willing to accept
temporary positions during their search for permanent employment.

    The  ACCOUNTEMPS temporary services division offers customers a reliable and
economical means  of dealing  with uneven  or  peak work  loads caused  by  such
predictable  events  as  vacations,  taking  inventories,  tax  work,  month-end
activities and special projects and  such unpredictable events as illnesses  and
emergencies.  Businesses increasingly view  the use of  temporary employees as a
means of controlling  personnel costs and  converting such costs  from fixed  to
variable.  The cost and inconvenience to  clients of hiring and firing permanent
employees are eliminated by  the use of  ACCOUNTEMPS temporaries. The  temporary
workers  are  employees of  ACCOUNTEMPS and  are paid  by ACCOUNTEMPS  only when
working on customer assignments. The customer  pays a fixed rate only for  hours
worked.

    ACCOUNTEMPS  clients may fill  their permanent employment  needs by using an
ACCOUNTEMPS employee  on a  trial basis  and, if  so desired,  "converting"  the
temporary position to a permanent position. The client typically pays a one-time
fee for such conversions.

    The  Company offers permanent placement  services through its office network
under the name ROBERT  HALF. The Company's ROBERT  HALF division specializes  in
placing  accounting, financial, tax, banking and data processing personnel. Fees
for successful  permanent placements  are  paid only  by  the employer  and  are
generally  a percentage  of the new  employee's annual compensation.  No fee for
permanent placement services is charged to employment candidates.

    OTHER ACTIVITIES

    The Company's OFFICETEAM  division places temporary  and permanent  high-end
office  and  administrative personnel,  ranging from  word processors  to office
managers. OFFICETEAM operates in  much the same fashion  as the ACCOUNTEMPS  and
ROBERT HALF divisions.

    The Company has a small operation involving only a limited number of offices
which   places   temporary   and  permanent   employees   in   paralegal,  legal
administrative and legal  secretarial positions  (operating under  the name  THE
AFFILIATES-R-).

    ORGANIZATION

    Management  of the Company's offices is coordinated from its headquarters in
Menlo Park, California. Office managers  are responsible for most activities  of
their offices, including sales, local advertising and marketing and recruitment.


    The  Company's  headquarters provides  support  and centralized  services to
Company-owned offices in the administrative, marketing, accounting, training and
legal areas, particularly as it relates to the standardization of the  operating
procedures of Company-owned offices.

    MARKETING AND RECRUITING

    The   Company  markets  its  services  to  clients  as  well  as  employment
candidates. Local  marketing  and recruiting  are  generally conducted  by  each
office  or  related  group  of  offices.  Advertising  directed  to  clients and
employment  candidates  consists  primarily  of  yellow  pages   advertisements,
classified advertisements and radio. Direct marketing through mail and telephone
solicitation  also  constitutes a  significant  portion of  the  Company's total
advertising. National advertising conducted by the Company consists primarily of
print  advertisements  in  national  newspapers,  magazines  and  certain  trade
journals.  The  Company also  conducts public  relations activities  designed to
enhance public recognition of the Company and its services. Local employees  are
encouraged to be active in civic organizations and industry and trade groups.

    The  Company owns many  trademarks, service marks  and tradenames, including
the "ROBERT HALF", "ACCOUNTEMPS" and "OFFICETEAM" marks, which are registered in
the United States and in a number of foreign countries.

    COMPETITION

    The Company faces competition in its  efforts to attract clients as well  as
high-quality specialized employment candidates. The permanent placement business
is highly competitive, with a number of firms offering services similar to those
provided  by the  Company, mostly  on a regional  or local  basis. The temporary
services industry is also highly competitive. There are several large nationwide
operations, some of which have greater resources than the Company. In many areas
the  local  companies  are  the  strongest  competitors.  The  most  significant
competitive  factors in the permanent  placement and temporary personnel service
markets are price  and the reliability  of service,  both of which  are often  a
function  of the availability and quality of personnel. Customers and employment
candidates may  use more  than  one permanent  or temporary  personnel  services
company.

    EMPLOYEES

    The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  presently  employ  approximately 1,150
regular full-time employees. The Company's offices employed approximately 59,000
different temporary employees on assignments during 1993.

    The  ACCOUNTEMPS  and  OFFICETEAM  temporary  employees  are  the  Company's
employees  for all purposes  while they are working  on assignments. The Company
pays the related costs of  employment, such as workers' compensation  insurance,
state  and  federal  unemployment  taxes,  social  security  and  certain fringe
benefits. The Company provides voluntary health insurance coverage to interested
temporary employees.

    FRANCHISING

    The Company is not  currently seeking to grant  additional franchises or  to
grant licenses for the operation of ROBERT HALF or ACCOUNTEMPS offices. However,
the  Company is exploring  the possibility of using  joint ventures or licensing
arrangements as a means of expanding its operations.

    The  Company  believes  its   relationships  with  its   independently-owned
franchisees are good. Franchisees operate their businesses autonomously, subject
to  the  requirements  of  the franchise  agreements.  The  franchise agreements
authorize franchisees  to establish  one  or more  ROBERT HALF  and  ACCOUNTEMPS
offices  within designated geographic areas.  The agreements provide for monthly
payments of royalties to the Company based on the franchisee's cash  collections
and  are generally  for a  term of twenty  years, renewable  at the franchisee's
option.

    OTHER INFORMATION

    The Company's current business constitutes  a single business segment.  (See
Item  8. Financial Statements  and Supplementary Data  for financial information
about the Company.)


    The Company is not dependent upon a  single customer or a limited number  of
customers.  The Company's operations are generally  more active in the first and
fourth quarters of a calendar  year. Order backlog is  not a material aspect  of
the  Company's business  and no  material portion  of the  Company's business is
subject to  government  contracts.  The  Company  does  not  have  any  material
expenditures  for research  and development.  Compliance with  federal, state or
local environmental  protection  laws has  no  material effect  on  the  capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.

    Information  about foreign  operations is  contained in  Note N  of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in  Item 8. The Company  does not have  export
sales.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

    The  Company's headquarters is located  in Menlo Park, California. Placement
activities are  conducted through  153  offices located  in the  United  States,
Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium and France. All of the offices are leased.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    The  Company is not a party to  any material pending legal proceedings other
than routine litigation incidental to its business.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

    No matter was submitted to a  vote of the Company's security holders  during
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

                                    PART II

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

    The  Company's Common  Stock is  listed for  trading on  the New  York Stock
Exchange under the symbol "RHI". On February 28, 1994, there were 1,337  holders
of record of the Common Stock.

    Following  is a list by fiscal quarters of  the sales prices of the stock as
quoted on the New York Stock Exchange:



    No cash  dividends were  paid in  1993 or  1992. The  Company, as  it  deems
appropriate,  may continue to retain all earnings for use in its business or may
consider paying a dividend in the future.


ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

    Following is a table of selected financial  data of the Company of the  last
five years:




ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993

    Temporary  services  revenues  increased  40%  during  1993,  including  the
revenues generated from the Company's OfficeTeam division, which was started  in
1991  to provide  highly-skilled office and  administrative personnel. Permanent
placement revenues increased 30%  during the year ended  December 31, 1993.  The
positive revenue comparisons reflect strong demand for the Company's specialized
personnel services.

    Net  service  revenues grew  at  a slower  rate  in 1992  compared  to 1991,
primarily as  a result  of the  general economic  recession. Temporary  services
revenues increased 9% while Robert Half division revenues decreased 21%.

    Gross  margin as a percentage of revenues  declined 1% between 1993 and 1992
and equaled 39% of revenue in 1993. In 1992, gross margin equaled 40% of revenue
and in 1991, gross  margin was 44% of  revenue. The percentage declines  related
principally  to a lower mix of the  higher permanent placement gross margins and
higher unemployment  insurance  costs  associated with  the  temporary  services
divisions.

    Selling,  general and administrative  expenses were $88  million during 1993
compared to $72 million in  1992 and $73 million  in 1991. Selling, general  and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was 29% in 1993, compared to
33%  in  1992 and  35% in  1991.  The percentage  declines were  attributable to
revenue growth coupled with the Company's continued cost containment.

    Amortization of intangible  assets increased from  1991 to 1993  due to  the
acquisitions in each of those years of additional personnel services operations.

    Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 decreased 7%
and 35%, respectively, over the comparable prior periods due to the reduction in
outstanding  indebtedness in both years and declining interest rates in the year
ending December 31, 1992.

    The provision for income taxes was 46%  in 1993, as compared to 45% in  1992
and 49% in 1991. The 1993 increase reflects the effect of the 1% increase in the
federal  corporate income tax rate  as a result of the  1993 Tax Act. Because of
the increase in pre-tax book income, the effect of the non-deductible intangible
amortization on the effective tax rate was reduced in 1993 as compared to  1992.
The  1992 reduction relative to 1991 was  due primarily to a one-time benefit in
the fourth quarter of 1992 for  the resolution of tax accounting issues  related
to  previous acquisitions. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new
standard on accounting for income taxes, which the Company was required to adopt
on January 1,  1993. The  cumulative effect of  the adoption  of the  accounting
method prescribed by the new standard was immaterial.

    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    The change in the Company's liquidity during the past three years is the net
effect  of funds generated  by operations and  the funds used  for the personnel
services acquisitions, principal payments on outstanding notes payable, and  the
securities repurchase program.

    The  Company's Board of  Directors previously authorized  the repurchase, on
the open market or in privately-negotiated  transactions, of up to 3.25  million
shares  of the  Company's common stock  or the equivalent  amount of Convertible
Debentures or  other  common  stock equivalents.  The  Company  has  repurchased
approximately  3.1 million shares of the  Company's common stock or common stock
equivalents. See Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Repurchases of
the securities have been funded with cash generated from operations and the bank
line of credit.

    On December  10,  1993, substantially  all  of its  outstanding  convertible
subordinated  debentures were  converted into common  stock of  the Company. See
Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

    The  Company's  working  capital  requirements  consist  primarily  of   the
financing  of  accounts receivable.  While there  can be  no assurances  in this
regard, the  Company  expects  that  internally generated  cash  plus  the  bank
revolving line of credit will be sufficient to support the working capital needs
of  the  Company's offices,  the Company's  fixed  payments and  other long-term
obligations.

                   are an integral part of these statements.


                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    PRINCIPLES  OF CONSOLIDATION.  The Consolidated Financial Statements include
the  accounts  of  Robert  Half  International  Inc.  (the  "Company")  and  its
subsidiaries,  all  of  which  are  wholly-owned.  The  Company  is  a  Delaware
corporation. All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated. Certain
reclassifications have been made  to the 1992 and  1991 financial statements  to
conform to the 1993 presentation.

    REVENUE  RECOGNITION.  Temporary  services revenues are  recognized when the
services are rendered by the Company's temporary employees. Permanent  placement
revenues  are recognized when  employment candidates accept  offers of permanent
employment. Reserves are established to estimate losses due to placed candidates
not remaining in  employment for  the Company's guarantee  period, typically  90
days.

    FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  Foreign income statement items are translated
at  the monthly  average exchange  rates prevailing  during the  period. Foreign
balance sheets are translated at  the current exchange rates  at the end of  the
period,  and  the  related  translation  adjustments  are  recorded  as  part of
Stockholders'  Equity.  Gains  and   losses  resulting  from  foreign   currency
transactions are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

    CASH  AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  For  purposes of the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows, the Company classifies all highly-liquid investments with a maturity
of three months or less as cash equivalents.

    INTANGIBLE ASSETS.    Intangible  assets  represent  the  cost  of  acquired
companies  in excess of  the fair market  value of their  net tangible assets at
acquisition date, and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period
of 40 years.

    INCOME TAXES.   Effective  January 1,  1993, the  Company adopted  Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 109, Accounting for  Income Taxes (FAS 109). Under FAS
109, deferred taxes are computed based  on the difference between the  financial
statement  and  income tax  bases of  assets and  liabilities using  the enacted
marginal tax rate.  As permitted under  the provisions of  FAS 109, the  Company
elected not to restate prior years and has determined that the cumulative effect
of implementation was immaterial.

NOTE B -- ACQUISITIONS
    In  July 1986, the Company  acquired all of the  outstanding stock of Robert
Half Incorporated, the franchisor of the Accountemps and Robert Half operations.
Subsequently, in  57  separate transactions  the  Company acquired  all  of  the
outstanding  stock of certain corporations operating Accountemps and Robert Half
franchised offices in the United States,  the United Kingdom and Canada as  well
as  other personnel services businesses. The Company has paid approximately $185
million in  cash, stock,  notes and  other indebtedness  in these  acquisitions,
excluding transaction costs and cash acquired.

    These  acquisitions were accounted for as  purchases, and the excess of cost
over the  fair  market  value of  the  net  tangible assets  acquired  is  being
amortized over 40 years using the straight-line method. Results of operations of
the  acquired companies  are included in  the Consolidated  Statements of Income
from the dates of acquisition. The acquisitions made during 1993 and 1992 had no
material impact on the pro forma results of operations.


             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE C -- NOTES PAYABLE AND OTHER INDEBTEDNESS
    The Company issued promissory notes as  well as other forms of  indebtedness
in  connection with certain acquisitions. These are due in varying installments,
carry varying interest rates and in  aggregate amount to $2,440,000 at  December
31,  1993,  and $3,510,000  at December  31,  1992. At  December 31,  1993, $1.5
million of the notes were secured by standby letters of credit (see Note D). The
following table shows  the schedule of  maturities for notes  payable and  other
indebtedness at December 31, 1993 (in thousands):



    At  December 31,  1993, all  of the  notes carried  fixed rates  of interest
ranging from 8.0% to 13.3%. The weighted average interest rate for the above was
approximately 11.1% and  8.5% for the  years ended December  31, 1993 and  1992,
respectively.

    As  part  of  a  Restructuring  in  1987,  a  newly  formed  corporation, BF
Enterprises, Inc., assumed  the obligation for  certain subordinated  debentures
issued  by  a predecessor  of the  Company.  At December  31, 1993,  the Company
remains contingently liable for $11.3 million of these subordinated  debentures,
payment  of  $9.5 million  of which  has been  provided for  by the  issuance of
letters of credit  to the  trustee for the  debentures by  BF Enterprises,  Inc.
Additionally,  pursuant to a  pledge and security agreement  entered into at the
time of Restructuring, BF Enterprises, Inc., has agreed to pledge to the Company
collateral (consisting of real estate, marketable securities and bank letters of
credit) if the net  worth of BF Enterprises,  Inc., falls below certain  minimum
levels.

NOTE D -- BANK LOAN (REVOLVING CREDIT)
    On November 1, 1993, the Company replaced the then existing unsecured credit
facility.  The  new  credit  facility  provides  a  line  of  credit  of  up  to
$80,000,000, which  is available  to  fund the  Company's general  business  and
working  capital needs, including acquisitions and the purchase of the Company's
common stock,  and to  cover the  issuance of  debt support  standby letters  of
credit up to $15,000,000.

    As of December 31, 1993, the Company had borrowed $30,300,000 on the line of
credit,  and had used $2,780,000  in debt support standby  letters of credit. Of
the $30,300,000 outstanding balance at December 31, 1993, $29,000,000 carried an
interest rate tied  to Eurodollar  rates plus  1.25% and  $1,300,000 carried  an
interest  rate at prime. There is a commitment  fee on the unused portion of the
entire credit  facility  of .25%.  The  loan  is subject  to  certain  financial
covenants which also affect the interest rates charged.

    The  credit facility has  the following scheduled  reduction in availability
(in thousands):



    The final maturity date for the credit facility is August 31, 2000.


             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE D -- BANK LOAN (REVOLVING CREDIT) (CONTINUED)
    As of  December  31, 1992,  the  Company  had borrowed  $35,600,000  of  the
borrowing facility in place at that time and had used $2,700,000 in debt support
standby  letters  of  credit. Of  the  $35,600,000 outstanding  loan  balance at
December 31, 1992, $25,000,000 carried an interest rate tied to Eurodollar rates
plus 1.25% and the remaining balance of $10,600,000 carried an interest rate  at
prime.

NOTE E -- CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES
    On  August 6, 1987,  the Company issued $74,750,000  principal amount of the
Convertible Subordinated  Debentures (the  "Convertible Debentures").  Prior  to
1993,  all but $22,745,000 of the Convertible Debentures were repurchased by the
Company pursuant  to  its  repurchase  program (see  Note  F).  The  Convertible
Debentures  were unsecured obligations of the  Company with an original maturity
date of August 1, 2012. Interest was payable semi-annually as of February 1  and
August  1 of each year to the registered  holders as of the preceding January 15
and July 15,  respectively. The  Convertible Debentures were  redeemable at  the
Company's option at any time on or after August 1, 1990, at declining redemption
prices.

    In  December  1993,  the  Company  called for  redemption  all  of  its then
outstanding Convertible Debentures. Holders  of $22,440,000 in principal  amount
elected  to convert their debentures into 1.02 million shares of common stock at
the conversion price of  $22.00 per share. The  remaining $305,000 in  principal
amount  of Convertible  Debentures were  redeemed at  102.9% of  their principal
amount plus accrued interest.

NOTE F -- SECURITIES REPURCHASE PROGRAM
    The  Company  was  previously  authorized  by  its  Board  of  Directors  to
repurchase  up to a total of 3.25  million shares of the Company's common stock,
or the  equivalent  amount  of  Convertible Debentures  or  other  common  stock
equivalents  from time  to time  on the open  market or  in privately negotiated
transactions. As of December 31, 1993,  3.1 million equivalent shares have  been
repurchased.  There were  no repurchases under  the program  during 1993. During

NOTE H -- EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
    Under  a  retirement  plan covering  one  current and  one  former executive
officer of  the  Company, monthly  benefits  are payable  equal  to 25%  of  the
participant's  base compensation as defined,  increased by an inflation formula.
The plan was  amended effective  May 31, 1992  to provide  a fixed  supplemental
benefit for the current employee during the first 15 years after retirement. The
current employee forfeited long-term incentive awards of equal value in exchange
for  this amendment. The  plan was also  amended effective May  21, 1991 for the
current employee  to  increase  the  percentage  of  base  compensation  to  30%
increasing thereafter by 3% for each year of service beyond the age of 50, up to
a  maximum of 66%. During 1993, the Company changed its discount rate assumption
from 8% to 6%. The effect of  both plan amendments and the discount rate  change
are  being amortized  over the employee's  expected future service  period of 15
years and will increase after-tax expense by approximately $76,000 per year. The
employee can require the Company to discharge its liability at defined intervals
by purchasing annuities.  At December  31, 1992  a liability  of $1,124,000  was
established  to cover the estimated unfunded cost of these benefits. This amount
was increased to  $1,721,000 at  December 31,  1993. Pre-tax  pension costs  for
these  plans were $188,000,  $131,000, and $72,000 for  the years ended December
31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. These charges were computed using certain
assumptions regarding salary increases, retirement age and life expectancy.

NOTE I -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
    Rental expense,  primarily  for  office premises,  amounted  to  $8,457,000,
$8,042,000  and $7,616,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively. The approximate minimum rental commitments for 1994 and thereafter
under non-cancelable leases in effect at  December 31, 1993, are as follows  (in
thousands):

NOTE J -- STOCK PLANS
    Under  various stock  plans, officers,  employees and  outside directors may
receive grants of restricted stock or  options to purchase common stock.  Grants
are  made  at the  discretion  of the  Compensation  Committee of  the  Board of
Directors. Grants usually vest over four years.

    Options granted under  the plans have  exercise prices ranging  from 85%  to
100%  of the  fair market  value of the  Company's common  stock at  the date of
grant, consist of both  incentive stock options  and nonstatutory stock  options
under the Internal Revenue Code, and generally have a term of ten years.

    Recipients  of restricted  stock do  not pay  any cash  consideration to the
Company for the shares, have the right to vote all shares subject to such grant,
and receive all dividends with respect to such shares, whether or not the shares
have vested.

    As of December 31, 1993 the total number of available grants under the plans
(consisting of either restricted stock or options) was 396,054.

    The following table reflects activity under all stock plans from January  1,
1991 through December 31, 1993 and the exercise prices:



    As  of December 31, 1993, an aggregate of 615,965 restricted common stock or
options to purchase common stock were vested.

NOTE K -- PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
    On July 23, 1990, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of
one Preferred Share Purchase Right (the  "Rights") on each outstanding share  of
the Company's common stock.

    The  Rights  will  be exercisable  only  if  a person  or  group  becomes an
Acquiring Person (as such term is defined in the Right's Agreement) or announces
a tender offer  the consummation  of which  would result  in a  person or  group
becoming  an Acquiring Person.  Each Right will entitle  stockholders to buy one
one-hundredth of a share of a new series of junior participating preferred stock
at an  exercise  price of  $65  (subject  to adjustment)  upon  certain  events.
Effective  October  28, 1993,  Acquiring  Person means  any  person or  group of
affiliated or associated  persons who shall  be the beneficial  owner of 15%  or
more  of the common stock of the  Company then outstanding, but does not include
the only  shareholder  (and affiliates  and  associates thereof)  known  by  the
Company  to have beneficial ownership  on October 28, 1993,  in excess of 15% of
the then outstanding common stock, provided that


             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE K -- PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS (CONTINUED)
such exclusion terminates immediately in the event that such shareholder (or any
such affiliate or associate) increases its beneficial ownership of common  stock
other than pursuant to certain specified transactions.

    If, after the Rights become exercisable, the Company is acquired in a merger
or other business combination transaction, or sells 50% or more of its assets or
earnings  power, each Right will entitle its  holder to purchase, at the Right's
then-current exercise price, a number  of the acquiring company's common  shares
having a market value at the time of twice the Right's exercise price.

    In addition, if a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person otherwise than
pursuant  to a cash  tender offer for all  shares in which  such person or group
increases its stake to 85% of the outstanding shares of common stock, each Right
will entitle its holder  (other than such  person or members  of such group)  to
purchase,  at the Right's then-current exercise price, a number of the Company's
common shares (or cash, other securities  or property) having a market value  of
twice the Right's exercise price.

    At any time after a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to
an  acquisition by such person or group of  50% or more of the common stock, the
Board of Directors  may exchange  the Rights (other  than Rights  owned by  such
person  or group), in  whole or in  part, at an  exchange ratio of  one share of
common stock  (or one  one-hundredth of  a share  of the  new series  of  junior
participating preferred stock) per Right.

    At  any time prior to ten days after  a person or group becomes an Acquiring
Person, the Rights are redeemable  for one cent per Right  at the option of  the
Board of Directors.

    The   dividend  distribution  was  made  on   August  8,  1990,  payable  to
stockholders of record on that date. The Rights will expire on July 23, 2000.

NOTE L -- INCOME PER SHARE
    Income per fully diluted share has been computed using the weighted  average
number  of shares  of fully  diluted common  stock and  common stock equivalents
outstanding during each period (12,630,000, 12,003,000 and 11,637,000 shares for
the years ending  December 31, 1993,  1992 and 1991,  respectively). An  assumed
conversion of the Convertible Debentures was not dilutive to income per share in
1993 (see Note E), 1992 or 1991.

NOTE M -- QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)
    The following tabulation shows certain quarterly financial data for 1993 and

for the three fiscal years ended in December 1993, is shown below. The Company's
areas  of operations  outside of  the United  States include  Canada, the United
Kingdom, Belgium  and France.  Revenues represent  total net  revenues from  the
respective  geographic areas.  Operating income  is net  revenues less operating

    We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  financial
position  of  Robert  Half  International  Inc.  (a  Delaware  corporation)  and

statements  of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial statements are  the
responsibility  of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

    We conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial  statements referred to above present  fairly,
in  all material respects,  the financial position  of Robert Half International
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended
December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
