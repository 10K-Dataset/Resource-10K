In this report, “Kraft,” “we,” “us” and “our” refers to Kraft Foods Inc.
and subsidiaries, and “Common Stock” refers to Kraft’s Class A common stock.

PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General

Kraft was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. We manufacture and market packaged food products, including snacks, beverages, cheese, convenient meals
and various packaged grocery products. We have operations in more than 70 countries and sell our products in approximately 150 countries. We have nine brands with revenues exceeding $1 billion:

Kraft

cheeses, dinners and dressings;

Oscar
Mayer

meats;

Philadelphia

cream cheese;

Maxwell House

and

Jacobs

coffee;

Nabisco

cookies and crackers and its

Oreo

cookie brand;

Milka

chocolates; and

LU

biscuits. We have more than 50 brands with
revenues of at least $100 million.

Prior to June 13, 2001, Kraft was a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”). On
June 13, 2001, we completed an initial public offering of 280,000,000 shares of our Common Stock at a price of $31.00 per share. In the first quarter of 2007, Altria spun off its remaining interest (89.0%) in Kraft on a pro rata basis to
Altria stockholders in a tax-free transaction. Effective as of the close of business on March 30, 2007, all Kraft shares owned by Altria were distributed to Altria’s stockholders, and our separation from Altria was completed.

Because Kraft Foods Inc. is a holding company, our principal source of funds is from our subsidiaries. Our wholly owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by
long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock.

Reportable
Segments

We manage and report operating results through two commercial units, Kraft North America and Kraft International. Kraft North America
operates in the U.S. and Canada, and we manage Kraft North America’s operations by product category. We manage Kraft International’s operations by geographic location.

Effective August 4, 2008, we completed the split-off of the

Post

cereals business. The results of the

Post

cereals business were reflected as discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of
earnings and prior period results were restated in a consistent manner.

In 2008, we implemented a new operating structure. Within the new structure,
business units now have full P&L accountability and are staffed accordingly. This also ensures that we are putting our resources closer to where we make decisions that affect our consumers and customers. Our corporate and shared service
functions continue to streamline their organizations and focus on core activities that can more efficiently support the goals of the business units. As a result of implementing the new operating structure, we began reporting the results of
operations under this new structure in the first quarter of 2008 and restated results from prior periods in a consistent manner. The changes were:

•

U.S. Cheese was organized as a standalone operating segment in order to create a more self-contained and integrated business unit in support of faster growth.

•

Our macaroni and cheese category, as well as other dinner products, were moved from our U.S. Convenient Meals segment to our U.S. Grocery segment to take
advantage of operating synergies.

•

Canada and North America Foodservice were structured as a standalone reportable segment. This change allows us to deliver on the unique requirements of the Canadian
consumer and customer while maintaining strong North American linkages to innovation, new product development and new capabilities to drive our business. Furthermore, it allows us to manage strategic customer decisions and continue to capture
cross-border sales and marketing synergies within our Foodservice operations.

Note 17,

Segment Reporting

, to our consolidated
financial statements includes a breakout of net revenues, segment operating income, total assets, depreciation expense and capital expenditures by reportable segment, as well as a breakout of net revenues, long-lived assets and total assets by
geographic region. Management uses segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment
operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which is a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles.


The relative percentages of total segment operating income attributable to each reportable segment were:

Our U.S. subsidiaries export coffee products, refreshment beverage products, grocery products, cheese, biscuits
and processed meats. In 2008, these exports from the U.S. amounted to $195 million.


Products or similar products contributing 10% or more of Kraft’s consolidated net revenues for the years ended
December 31, were:

Our major brands within each reportable segment and consumer sector are:


Effective January 2009, we began implementing changes built on our Kraft Europe Reorganization and our

Organizing For Growth

initiative. In line with our strategies, we are evolving how we work in Europe in two key ways:

•

We are transitioning our European Biscuit, Chocolate, Coffee and Cheese categories to fully integrated business units, further strengthening our focus on these core
categories. To ensure decisions are made faster and closer to customers and consumers, each category will be fully accountable for the P&L, including marketing, manufacturing and R&D. Category leadership, based in Zurich, will report to the
Kraft Europe President, and the country organizations will be aligned with the category structure under our Kraft Europe Reorganization and report directly to category management. Going forward, these business units will comprise the Kraft Foods
Europe segment.

•

We are aligning the reporting of our Central Europe operations into our Kraft Foods Developing Markets segment to help build critical scale in these countries. We
intend to operate a country-led model in these markets and, as a result, we have no plans to implement the Kraft Europe Reorganization in Central Europe. This change also will keep Kraft Foods Europe management fully focused on implementing their
new structure and growing the business.

As a result of implementing this new operating structure, we will report the results of
operations under this new structure beginning in the first quarter of 2009 and will restate results from prior periods in a consistent manner.

Significant Acquisitions and Divestitures

LU Biscuit Acquisition:

On November 30, 2007, we acquired the global

LU

biscuit business of Groupe Danone S.A. (“

LU

Biscuit”) for €5.1 billion (approximately $7.6 billion) in cash. The acquisition
included 32 manufacturing facilities and approximately 14,000 employees. We acquired net assets consisting primarily of goodwill of $4,052 million (which will not be deductible for statutory tax purposes), intangible assets of
$3,546 million (substantially all of which are indefinite-lived), receivables of $757 million, property, plant and equipment of $1,054 million and inventories of $204 million, and assumed liabilities of $1,063 million consisting
primarily of accounts payable and accruals. These purchase price allocations were based upon appraisals that were


finalized in the third quarter of 2008.

LU

Biscuit contributed net revenues of $3.2 billion during 2008, and $2.8 billion on a proforma basis during
2007.

LU

Biscuit reported results from operations on a one month lag in 2007; as such, there was no impact on our operating results. On a proforma basis,

LU

Biscuit’s net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007 would
have been insignificant to Kraft.

Post Cereals Split-off:

On August 4, 2008, we completed the split-off of the

Post

cereals business into Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. (“Ralcorp”), after an exchange with our shareholders. The exchange is expected to be tax-free to participating
shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

In this split-off transaction, approximately 46.1 million shares of Kraft Common Stock were
tendered for $1,644 million. Our shareholders had the option to exchange some or all of their shares of Kraft Common Stock and receive shares of common stock of Cable Holdco, Inc. (“Cable Holdco”). Cable Holdco was our wholly owned
subsidiary that owned certain assets and liabilities of the

Post

cereals business. In exchange for the contribution of the

Post

cereals business, Cable Holdco issued approximately $665 million in debt securities, issued shares of its
common stock and assumed a $300 million credit facility. Following the merger of Cable Holdco and a Ralcorp subsidiary, the Cable Holdco common stock was exchanged for shares of Ralcorp common stock on a one-for-one basis. Upon closing, we used the
cash equivalent net proceeds, approximately $960 million, to repay debt. As a result of the split-off, we recorded a gain on discontinued operations of $937 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, in 2008. The results of the

Post

cereals
business were reflected as discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings and prior period results were restated in a consistent manner.

See Note 2,

Acquisitions and Divestitures

, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these transactions.

Customers

Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 27% of our net revenues in 2008, 29% in 2007 and 28% in 2006. Our ten
largest customers accounted for approximately 36% of our net revenues in 2008, 40% in 2007 and 38% in 2006. One of our customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 16% of our net revenues in 2008, 15% in 2007 and 14% in 2006.

Seasonality

Demand for some of our products may be
influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other annual events. However, sales of our products are generally evenly balanced throughout the year due to the offsetting nature of demands for our diversified product portfolio.

Competition

We face competition in all aspects of our business.
Competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies. Some competitors may have different profit objectives and some international competitors may be more or less susceptible to currency exchange
rates. We also compete with generic products and retailer brands, wholesalers and cooperatives. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. Moreover, improving
our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures.

Distribution

Our products are generally sold to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, convenience stores, gasoline stations,
drug stores, value stores and other retail food outlets. In general, the retail trade for food products is consolidating. Food products are distributed through distribution centers, satellite warehouses, company-operated and public cold-storage
facilities, depots and other facilities. We currently distribute most products in North America through a combination of direct-store-delivery and warehouse delivery. Kraft International’s products are distributed through warehouse delivery and
through the services of independent sales offices and agents. We support our selling efforts through three principal sets of activities: consumer advertising in broadcast, print, outdoor and on-line media; consumer incentives such as coupons and
contests; and trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers.


Raw Materials

We
are a major purchaser of dairy, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn products, soybean and vegetable oils, nuts, meat products, and sugar and other sweeteners. We also use significant quantities of plastic, glass and cardboard to package our products, and
natural gas for our factories and warehouses. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production.

We purchase our dairy raw material requirements, including milk and cheese, from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors.
The prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by market supply and demand, as well as by government programs. Dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007. Significant cost items in our
biscuit and grocery products are grains (wheat, corn and soybean oil). Grain costs have experienced significant increases as a result of burgeoning global demand for food, livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Grain costs on
average were higher in 2008 than in 2007. The most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans, which are purchased on world markets. Green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply, changes in the
value of the U.S. dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products. Green coffee bean costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007. A significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa,
which is purchased on world markets, and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the British pound and the U.S. dollar relative to certain other currencies. Cocoa bean and cocoa butter
costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007.

During 2008, our aggregate commodity costs rose significantly as a result of higher dairy, coffee,
cocoa, wheat, nuts, meat products, soybean oil and packaging costs. For 2008, our commodity costs were approximately $1.8 billion higher than 2007, following an increase of approximately $1.3 billion for 2007 compared with 2006. Overall,
we expect commodity costs to moderately increase in 2009.

The prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products generally
reflect external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a
result of these factors, we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of price fluctuations in our principal raw
materials. However, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and these strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs.

Intellectual Property

We consider our trademarks, in the aggregate, to be material to our business. We
protect our trademarks by registration or otherwise in the U.S. and in other markets where we sell our products. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used, and in other countries, for as long as
it is registered. Registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. From time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in particular locations. Similarly, we sell some of our
products under brands we license from third parties. These licensed brands include, among others:

•

Starbucks

coffee,

Seattle’s Best

coffee and

Tazo

teas for sale in U.S. grocery stores and other distribution channels;

•

Starbucks

and

Seattle’s Best

coffee T-Discs and

Tazo

teas T-Discs for use in our

Tassimo

hot beverage system;

•

Capri Sun

packaged juice drinks for sale in the U.S., Canada and within our Developing Markets segment;

•

Taco Bell Home Originals

Mexican style food products for sale in U.S. grocery stores;

•

California Pizza Kitchen

frozen pizzas for sale in grocery stores in the U.S. and Canada; and

•

South Beach Living

pizzas, meals, breakfast wraps, lunch wrap kits, crackers, cookies, snack bars, cereals and dressings for sale in grocery stores in the
U.S.

Additionally, we own numerous patents worldwide. While our patent portfolio is material to our
business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business. We have either been issued patents or have patent applications pending that relate to a number of
current and potential products, including products licensed to others. Patents, issued or applied for, cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our
issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual


protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the
patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We consider that in the aggregate our patent applications, patents and licenses under patents owned by third parties are of material importance to our
operations.

We also have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and related intellectual property rights that are not
registered.

Research and Development

We pursue four
objectives in research and development: product safety and quality; growth through new products; superior consumer satisfaction; and reduced costs. We have approximately 2,400 food scientists, chemists and engineers working primarily in six key
technology centers: East Hanover, New Jersey; Glenview, Illinois; Tarrytown, New York; Banbury, United Kingdom; Paris, France; and Munich, Germany. These technology centers are equipped with pilot plants and state-of-the-art instruments. Research
and development expense was $499 million in 2008, $442 million in 2007 and $414 million in 2006.

Regulation

Our U.S. food products and packaging materials are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration or, for products containing meat and poultry, the Food Safety
and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These agencies enact and enforce regulations relating to the manufacturing, distribution and labeling of food products.

In addition, various states regulate our U.S. operations by licensing plants, enforcing federal and state standards for selected food products, grading food products, inspecting plants and warehouses,
regulating trade practices related to the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products.

Many of the food
commodities we use in our U.S. operations are subject to governmental agricultural programs. These programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to Congressional and administrative review.

All of our non-U.S. based operations are subject to local and national regulations, some of which are similar to those applicable to our U.S.
operations. For example, in the EU, requirements apply to labeling, packaging, food content, pricing, marketing and advertising and related areas.

Environmental Regulation

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of
the environment. We accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Recoveries of
environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. In the U.S., the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and
Superfund, which imposes joint and severable liability on each responsible party. As of December 31, 2008, our subsidiaries were involved in 67 active Superfund and other similar actions in the U.S. related to current operations and
certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability.

Outside the U.S., we are subject to applicable multi-national, national and local
environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. We have specific programs across our international business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements.

Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with
environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results. However, we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation actions.

Employees

At December 31, 2008, we employed approximately
98,000 people worldwide. Labor unions represent approximately 43% of our 39,000 U.S. employees. Most of the unionized workers at our domestic locations are represented under contracts with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers
International Union; the United Food and Commercial Workers


International Union; and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. These contracts expire at various times throughout the next several years. Outside the
U.S., labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 72% of our 59,000 employees. Our business units are subject to various laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. These laws and regulations are
specific to the location of each enterprise. In addition, in accordance with EU requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We believe that our relationships with employees
and their representative organizations are good.

In 2008, we completed our five-year restructuring program (the “Restructuring Program”). In
connection with our severance initiatives, as of December 31, 2008, we had eliminated approximately 15,200 positions, and we had announced our intent to eliminate an additional 3,800 positions.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

You should read the following risk factors
carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial
condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be
additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, performance or financial condition in the future.

We operate in a highly competitive industry, which may affect our profitability.

The food industry is intensely competitive. We compete based on price, product innovation, product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity and the ability to identify
and satisfy consumer preferences. From time to time, we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain our market share. Competition and customer pressures, however, also
may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other input cost increases. Our results of operations will suffer if profit margins decrease, as a result of either a reduction in prices or increased input costs,
and if we are unable to increase sales volumes to offset those profit margin decreases.

We may also need to increase spending on marketing,
advertising and new product innovation to protect existing market share or capture increased market share. The success of our investments is subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance. As a
result, our increased expenditures may not maintain or enhance market share and could result in lower profitability.

Our brands may be challenged
to compete against lower-priced private label products, particularly in times of economic downturns.

Retailers are increasingly offering private label
products that compete with some of our products. Consumers’ willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer products that appeal to consumers at the right price. It is also important
that our products provide higher value and / or quality to our customers than less expensive alternatives. If the difference in value or quality between our products and those of store brands narrows, or if such difference in quality is
perceived to have narrowed, then consumers may not buy our products. Furthermore, during periods of economic uncertainty, such as we are currently experiencing, consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands,
which could reduce sales volumes of our higher margin products or there could be a shift in our product mix to our lower margin offerings. If we are not able to maintain or improve our brand image or value
proposition, it could have a material effect on our market share and our profitability.

The consolidation of retail customers, the loss of a
significant customer, or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could affect our operating margins, our profitability, our sales and our results of operations.

Retail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors in the U.S., the EU and our other major markets, continue to consolidate. These consolidations have produced large,
sophisticated customers with increased buying power. These larger retailers, capable of operating with reduced inventories, can resist price increases and demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored
products. They also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products. The consolidation of retail customers also increases the risk that a severe adverse impact on their business operations could
have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. Also, our retail customers may be affected by the current economic environment. For example, they may not have access to funds or financing and that could cause them to delay, decrease or
cancel purchases of our products, or to not pay us or to delay paying us for previous purchases.

A few of our customers are material to our business and
operations. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 16% of our net revenues during 2008. During 2008, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 27% of our net revenues. There can be no
assurance that all significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities that they have in the past. The loss of any one of our significant customers or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could
have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

Increased price volatility for commodities we purchase may affect our
profitability.

We are a major purchaser of commodities, including dairy, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn products, soybean and vegetable oils, nuts,
meat products, and sugar and other sweeteners. We also use significant quantities of plastic, glass and cardboard to package our products, and natural gas for our factories and warehouses. Price volatility for commodities we purchase has
increased due to conditions outside of our control, including the current economic environment, currency fluctuations,


availability of supply, weather, consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs. Although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as
an integral part of our overall risk management program, continued volatility in the prices of commodities we purchase could increase the costs of our products and services, and our profitability could suffer.

Our product sales depend on our ability to predict, identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, and our ability to develop and offer new
products rapidly enough to meet those changes.

Consumer preferences for food products change continually. For example, recently, consumers have
been increasingly focused on health and wellness with respect to the food products they buy. As a result, over the last several years our products have been subject to scrutiny relating to the health implications of obesity and trans-fatty
acids. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences. We have been and will continue to be affected by
publicity concerning the health implications of our products, some of which could negatively influence consumer perception and acceptance of our products and marketing programs.

Furthermore, if we do not succeed in offering products that appeal to consumers, our sales and market share will decrease, and our profitability could
suffer. We must be able to distinguish among short-term fads, mid-term trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to
introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales could decline. In addition, because of our varied consumer base, we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer
preferences. If we fail to successfully expand our product offerings across a multitude of product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories, demand for our products will decrease
and our profitability could suffer.

Our international operations are subject to additional risks.

We generated approximately 49% of our 2008 sales, 43% of our 2007 sales and 40% of our 2006 sales in foreign countries. Our international operations are subject to
inherent risks, including fluctuations in currency values, unpredictability of foreign currency exchange controls, discriminatory fiscal policies, unexpected changes in local regulations and laws, and the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies
in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, foreign jurisdictions could impose tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and other similar restrictions on our international sales. Moreover, our international business operations could be interrupted and
negatively affected by economic changes, terrorist activity, political unrest, and other economic or political uncertainties. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which could adversely affect
our profitability.

If we are unable to expand our operations in certain emerging markets, our growth rate could be negatively affected.

In 2007, we unveiled our strategies to grow our international operations with increased focus on four emerging markets: Brazil, Russia, China and other
regions of Southeast Asia. The success of our international operations depends in part on our ability to grow our business in these and other emerging markets. In some cases, emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility and
greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions. In addition, emerging markets are becoming more competitive as other international companies grow globally and local, low cost manufacturers expand their production capacities. If we are
unable to increase our business in emerging markets, our market share and profitability could be adversely affected.

We may not be able to successfully
consummate proposed acquisitions or divestitures or successfully integrate acquired businesses.

From time to time, we evaluate acquisition
candidates that would strategically fit our business objectives. If we are unable to complete, successfully integrate and develop these acquisition candidates to realize revenue growth and cost savings, our
financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, from time to time, we divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives, or do not meet our growth or profitability targets. Our profitability
may be affected by either gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from those businesses. Also, we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us. Moreover, we
may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures which may reduce our profitability. Finally, our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial, managerial and operational risks, including
diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, inaccurate estimates
of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings, potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses, and indemnities and potential
disputes with the buyers or sellers. Any of these activities could affect our product sales, financial conditions and results of operations.


Business process improvement initiatives to simplify and harmonize our business processes may fail to operate as
designed and intended.

We regularly implement business process improvement initiatives to simplify and harmonize our systems processes and to optimize
our performance. Our current business process initiatives include, but are not limited to, the Kraft Europe Reorganization, the delivery of an SAP enterprise resource planning application, and the outsourcing of certain administrative functions. If
our business process improvement initiatives fail, our ability to improve existing operations and support future growth could be delayed.

Product
recalls, injuries caused by products or other legal claims could affect our sales, reputation and profitability.

Selling products for human consumption
involves inherent legal risks. We could be required to recall products due to product contamination, spoilage or other adulteration, product misbranding or product tampering. We may also suffer losses if our products or operations
violate applicable laws or regulations, or if our products cause injury, illness or death. In addition, our advertising could be the target of claims of false or deceptive advertising. A significant product liability or other legal
judgment against us, or a widespread product recall may adversely affect our profitability. Moreover, even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful, has no merit or is not pursued, the negative publicity
surrounding assertions against our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation and profitability.

We operate in a highly
regulated environment.

Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign agencies. New regulations
and changes to existing regulations are issued regularly. Increased governmental regulation of the food industry, such as proposed requirements designed to enhance food safety or to regulate imported ingredients, could increase our costs and
adversely affect our profitability.

The effects of the present economic environment on the credit markets and changes in our credit ratings could
adversely affect our liquidity.

Our $4.5 billion revolving credit facility supports our commercial paper issuances. We use our commercial paper
program, in addition to international credit lines, for daily funding requirements. The present economic environment, in general, has restricted access to the credit markets. If the present economic environment worsens, our access to commercial
paper, our ability to refinance our credit facility by the time it expires in April 2010 and our ability to secure additional long or short-term financing, on terms and within a time period acceptable to us, could negatively affect our liquidity. In
addition, a downgrade in our credit ratings would likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue, and it could raise our borrowing costs for both short-term and long-term debt offerings.

Volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and have a negative impact on our operating results and
profitability.

At the end of 2008, the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was $9.3 billion and assets
were $7.0 billion. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans.
Among other factors, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can (i) affect the level of plan funding; (ii) cause volatility in the net periodic pension
cost; and (iii) increase our future funding requirements. In addition, if we divest certain businesses, we may be required to increase future contributions to the benefit plans and the related net periodic pension cost could
increase.

We expect to make approximately $390 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2009, which is approximately $170 million more than we
made in 2008. We also expect that our net pension cost will increase by approximately $200 million to approximately $440 million in 2009. The current economic environment increases the risk that we may be required to make additional cash
contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension cost beyond 2009.

Item 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments.

We have received no written comments
regarding our quarterly, annual or current reports from the staff of the SEC that remain unresolved.


Item 2.

Properties.

We have 168 manufacturing and processing facilities
worldwide. In North America, we have 58 facilities, and outside of North America, we have 110 facilities located in 45 countries. These manufacturing and processing facilities are located throughout the following territories:

We own 160 and lease 8 of these manufacturing and processing facilities. It is our practice to maintain all of our
plants and properties in good condition, and we believe they are suitable and adequate for our present needs.

We have publicly announced, but not yet
completed, the sale or closure of four facilities in Canada, one facility in Europe, three facilities in Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, three facilities in Latin America and three facilities in Asia Pacific. The numbers above include these
facilities.

As of December 31, 2008, our distribution facilities consisted of 316 distribution centers and depots worldwide. We own 39 of these
distribution centers and 3 of these depots, and we lease 125 of these distribution centers and 149 of these depots. In North America, we had 303 distribution centers and depots, more than 75% of which support our direct-store-delivery systems.
Outside North America, we had 13 distribution centers in 8 countries. These facilities are in good condition, and we believe they have sufficient capacity to meet our distribution needs in the near future.

In 2008, we completed our five-year Restructuring Program. As part of the Restructuring Program, we announced the closure of 36 facilities, including 6 plant closures
announced during 2008.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

We are defendants in a variety of legal
proceedings. Plaintiffs in a few of those cases seek substantial damages. We cannot predict with certainty the results of these proceedings. However, we believe that the final outcome of these proceedings will not materially affect our financial
results.

Kraft has been involved in litigation with The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”) concerning three
patents related to roast and ground coffee and the packaging for that coffee. During the course of that litigation P&G sold its coffee business to the J. M. Smucker Company which now owns The Folgers Coffee Company
(“Folgers”). On January 16, 2009, we settled the litigation relating to all of those patents and, as part of that settlement, agreed to arbitrate with Folgers the claim relating to U.S. Patent Number 5,721,005 related to roast,
ground and flaked coffee products that have been fast-roasted. We do not believe that an adverse finding in this arbitration would materially affect our financial results.

Executive Summary

The following executive summary is intended to provide significant highlights of the Discussion and Analysis that
follows.

•

Net revenues in 2008 increased 16.8% to $42.2 billion. Net revenues in 2007 increased 8.7% to $36.1 billion.

•

Diluted EPS increased 18.5% to $1.92 in 2008, and decreased 12.4% to $1.62 in 2007. Diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 17.6% to $1.22 in 2008, and
decreased 13.5% to $1.48 in 2007.

stockholders in a tax-free transaction. Effective as of the close of business on March 30, 2007, all Kraft shares owned by Altria were distributed to Altria’s stockholders, and our separation from Altria was completed.


Discussion and Analysis

Growth Strategy

At the Consumer Analyst Group of New York (“CAGNY”) Conference in February 2009, we
presented the progress we made in 2008 on our long-term growth strategy and our plans for year three of our plan to return Kraft to reliable growth. Our four growth strategies and 2008 developments are summarized below.

Build a high performing organization

– We have done a lot over the past two years to rewire Kraft and create a high performance culture. We have strengthened
our senior leadership team and leveraged our business unit structure. We will continue to raise the bar on talent through internal development and external hiring with the goal of organizational diversity at all levels. Effective January 2009, we
are reorganizing Kraft Europe to better maximize our potential there, and we already integrated the legacy Kraft and

LU

Biscuit operations within key markets in our Developing Markets segment. We are further building scale in Developing
Markets by using business models relevant in individual geographies and countries.

Reframe our categories

– We continue to reframe our
categories in order to make them more relevant and contemporary with our consumers. We are utilizing our “Growth Diamond” to contemporize our base business, specifically to identify health and wellness trajectory-changing ideas and skew
our resources toward those categories, countries and brands that have the highest potential for return. Furthermore, we strengthened our category mix through various acquisitions, divestitures and product pruning over the last few years.

Exploit our sales capabilities

– We will continue to use our large scale as a competitive advantage and better leverage our portfolio through superior
execution. Our “Wall-to-Wall” initiative for Kraft North America combined the executional benefits of direct-store-delivery used in our Biscuit business unit with the economics of our warehouse delivery to drive faster growth. We are
expanding upon that idea with “High Visibility Wall-to-Wall” in large, high turnover stores and geographies.

Drive down costs without
compromising quality

– We have found new ways to drive sustainable cost savings, while continuing to invest in the quality of our core brands, despite significant increases in product costs. We will continue to leverage quality as a growth
driver by increasing the percentage of products rated superior and preferred. We plan to improve gross margins with our new operating structure in Europe and with the implementation of SAP as our core system in North America and Europe.

Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results

Acquisitions and Divestitures

LU Biscuit Acquisition:

On November 30, 2007, we acquired the global

LU

biscuit business of Groupe Danone S.A. (“

LU

Biscuit”) for €5.1 billion (approximately $7.6 billion) in cash. The acquisition
included 32 manufacturing facilities and approximately 14,000 employees. We acquired net assets consisting primarily of goodwill of $4,052 million (which will not be deductible for statutory tax purposes), intangible assets of
$3,546 million (substantially all of which are indefinite-lived), receivables of $757 million, property, plant and equipment of $1,054 million and inventories of $204 million, and assumed liabilities of $1,063 million consisting
primarily of accounts payable and accruals. These purchase price allocations were based upon appraisals that were finalized in the third quarter of 2008. We used borrowings of €5.1 billion to finance this acquisition. Interest incurred on these
borrowings was the primary driver of the $533 million increase in interest expense during 2008.

LU

Biscuit contributed net revenues of $3.2 billion during 2008, and $2.8 billion on a proforma basis during 2007.

LU

Biscuit reported
results from operations on a one month lag in 2007; as such, there was no impact on our operating results. On a proforma basis,

LU

Biscuit’s net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007 would have been insignificant to Kraft.

United Biscuits Acquisition:

In 2006, we acquired the
Spanish and Portuguese operations of United Biscuits (“UB”) for approximately $1.1 billion. The non-cash acquisition was financed by our assumption of $541 million of debt issued by the acquired business immediately prior to the
acquisition, as well as $530 million of value for the redemption of our outstanding investment in UB, primarily deep-discount securities. The redemption of our outstanding investment resulted in a gain on closing of $251 million, or $0.09 per
diluted share, in the third quarter of 2006.

Post Cereals Split-off:

On August 4, 2008, we completed the split-off of the

Post

cereals business into Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. (“Ralcorp”), after an exchange with our shareholders. The exchange is expected to be
tax-free to participating shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.


In this split-off transaction, approximately 46.1 million shares of Kraft Common Stock were tendered for $1,644
million. Our shareholders had the option to exchange some or all of their shares of Kraft Common Stock and receive shares of common stock of Cable Holdco, Inc. (“Cable Holdco”). Cable Holdco was our wholly owned subsidiary that owned
certain assets and liabilities of the

Post

cereals business. In exchange for the contribution of the

Post

cereals business, Cable Holdco issued approximately $665 million in debt securities, issued shares of its common stock and
assumed a $300 million credit facility. Upon closing, we used the cash equivalent net proceeds, approximately $960 million, to repay debt. As a result of the split-off, we recorded a gain on discontinued operations of $937 million, or $0.62 per
diluted share, in 2008.

On June 25, 2008, Cable Holdco filed a registration statement on Form S-1/S-4/A with the SEC that announced the start of the
exchange offer. Approximately 30.5 million shares of Cable Holdco were offered in exchange for Kraft Common Stock at an exchange ratio of 0.6606. The exchange ratio was calculated using the daily volume-weighted average prices of Kraft Common
Stock and Ralcorp common stock on the NYSE on the last three trading days of the offer, which expired on August 4, 2008. The exchange offer was over-subscribed and as a result, the number of shares of Kraft Common Stock accepted for exchange in
the offer was prorated. Following the merger of Cable Holdco and a Ralcorp subsidiary, the Cable Holdco common stock was exchanged for shares of Ralcorp common stock on a one-for-one basis.

The

Post

cereals business included such cereals as

Honey Bunches of Oats

,

Pebbles

,

Shredded Wheat

,

Selects

,

Grape-Nuts

and

Honeycomb

. Under Kraft, the brands in this transaction were distributed primarily in North America. In addition to the

Post

brands, the transaction included four manufacturing facilities, certain manufacturing equipment and
approximately 1,230 employees who joined Ralcorp as part of the transaction.

The results of the

Post

cereals business were reflected as
discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings and prior period results were restated in a consistent manner. Pursuant to the

Post

cereals business Transition Services Agreement, we agreed to provide certain sales,
co-manufacturing, distribution, information technology, and accounting and finance services to Ralcorp for up to 12 months, with Ralcorp’s option to extend it for an additional 6 months.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we increased our gain on discontinued operations by $77 million to correct for a deferred tax liability that should have been
written-off upon the split-off of the

Post

cereals business. As such, our gain from the split-off of the

Post

cereals business was $937 million.

Summary results of operations for the

Post

cereals business through August 4, 2008, were as follows:

Other Divestitures:

In February 2009, we reached an agreement to divest a juice operation in Brazil. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and we expect it to close by mid-2009.


In 2008, we received $153 million in net proceeds, and recorded pre-tax losses of $92 million on divestitures, primarily
related to a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and four operations in Spain. We recorded after-tax losses of $64 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, on these divestitures.

Included in those divestitures were the following, which were a condition of the EU Commission’s approval of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition:

•

We divested an operation in Spain. From this divestiture, we received $86 million in proceeds and recorded pre-tax losses of $74 million.

•

We divested a biscuit operation in Spain and a trademark in Hungary that we had previously acquired as part of the

LU

Biscuit acquisition. As such, the
impacts of these divestitures were reflected as adjustments to the purchase price allocations.

In 2007, we received $216 million in
proceeds and recorded pre-tax gains of $15 million on the divestitures of our hot cereal assets and trademarks, our sugar confectionery assets in Romania and related trademarks and our flavored water and juice brand assets and related
trademarks, including

Veryfine

and

. We recorded an after-tax loss of $3 million on these divestitures to reflect the differing book and tax bases of our hot cereal assets and trademarks divestiture.

In 2006, we received $946 million in proceeds and recorded pre-tax gains of $117 million on the divestitures of our pet snacks brand and assets, rice brand and
assets, certain Canadian assets, our industrial coconut assets, a U.S. biscuit brand and a U.S. coffee plant. We recorded after-tax gains of $31 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, on these divestitures, which reflects the tax expense of $57
million related to the differing book and tax bases on our pet snacks brand and assets divestiture.

The aggregate operating results of the divestitures
discussed above, other than the divestiture of the

Post

cereals business, were not material to our financial statements in any of the periods presented. Refer to Note 17,

Segment Reporting

, for details of all (losses) / gains on
divestitures by segment. The net impacts to segment operating income from (losses) / gains on divestitures, along with resulting asset impairment charges, are summarized in the table below.

Asset Impairment Charges

In 2008, we recorded aggregate asset
impairment charges of $140 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. During our 2008 review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $44 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands, France and Puerto
Rico. In addition, in December 2008, we reached a preliminary agreement to divest a juice operation in Brazil and reached an agreement to sell a cheese plant in Australia. In anticipation of divesting the juice operation in Brazil, we recorded
an asset impairment charge of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The charge primarily included the write-off of associated intangible assets of $8 million and property, plant and equipment of $4 million. In anticipation of selling the cheese
plant in Australia, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $28 million to property, plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of 2008. Additionally, in 2008, we divested a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation, and incurred an asset impairment
charge of $55 million in connection with the divestiture. This charge primarily included the write-off of associated goodwill of $34 million and property, plant and equipment of $16 million. We recorded the aggregate asset impairment charges within
asset impairment and exit costs.

No impairments resulted from our 2007 annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets. Additionally, in
2007, we divested our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks and incurred an asset impairment charge of $120 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in recognition of the divestiture. The charge primarily included the write-off of
associated intangible assets of $70 million and property, plant and equipment of $47 million and was recorded within asset impairment and exit costs.

We
recorded aggregate asset impairment charges in 2006 amounting to $424 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. During our 2006 annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $24 million charge for the impairment of
intangible assets in Egypt and our hot cereal intangible assets in the U.S. In addition, we incurred an asset impairment charge of $69 million in 2006 in anticipation of the 2007 divestiture of our hot cereal assets and trademarks. The charge
primarily included the write-off of a portion of the associated goodwill of $15 million and intangible assets of $52 million. Additionally, in 2006, we incurred an asset impairment charge of $86 million in recognition of the pet snacks brand and
assets divestiture. The charge primarily included the write-off of a portion of the associated goodwill of $25 million and intangible assets of $55 million. Also during 2006, we re-evaluated the business model for our

Tassimo

hot beverage
system due to lagging revenues. This evaluation resulted in a $245 million asset impairment charge from lower utilization of existing manufacturing capacity. We recorded the aggregate asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit
costs.


Refer to Note 6,

Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs

, for details of all asset impairment charges by
segment. The net impacts to segment operating income from (losses) / gains on divestitures and the corresponding asset impairment charges are summarized in the table below.

(1)    This segment was formerly known as U.S. Snacks and Cereals.

Restructuring Program

In 2008, we completed our five-year restructuring program (the “Restructuring Program”). The objectives of this program were to leverage our global scale, realign and lower our cost structure, and optimize
capacity. As part of the Restructuring Program, we:

•

incurred $3.1 billion in pre-tax charges reflecting asset disposals, severance and implementation costs;

•

announced the closure of 36 facilities and announced the elimination of approximately 19,000 positions;

•

will use cash to pay for $2.0 billion of the $3.1 billion in charges; and

•

anticipate reaching cumulative, annualized savings of $1.4 billion for the total program.

In 2008, we implemented a new operating structure built on three core elements: business units; shared services that leverage the scale of our global portfolio; and a
streamlined corporate staff. Within the new structure, business units now have full P&L accountability and are staffed accordingly. This also ensures that we are putting our resources closer to where we make decisions that affect our consumers
and customers. Our corporate and shared service functions continue to streamline their organizations and focus on core activities that can more efficiently support the goals of the business units. The intent is to simplify, streamline and increase
accountability, with the ultimate goal of generating reliable growth for Kraft. In total, we will eliminate approximately 1,500 positions as we streamline our headquarter functions.

We incurred charges under the Restructuring Program from continuing operations of $989 million in 2008 or $0.45 per diluted share; $447 million in 2007, or $0.19 per diluted share; and $670 million in 2006, or
$0.27 per diluted share. Since the inception of the Restructuring Program, we have paid cash for $1.5 billion of the $3.1 billion in charges. At December 31, 2008, we had $489 million accrued in Restructuring Program costs. As part of the
Restructuring Program, we announced the closure of six plants during 2008. In connection with our severance initiatives, as of December 31, 2008, we had eliminated approximately 15,200 positions, and we had announced our intent to eliminate an
additional 3,800 positions.

Under the Restructuring Program, we recorded asset impairment and exit costs from continuing operations of $884 million during
2008, $320 million during 2007 and $575 million during 2006. We recorded implementation costs from continuing operations of $105 million in 2008, $127 million in 2007 and $95 million in 2006. Implementation costs are directly attributable to exit
costs; however, they do not qualify for treatment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

. These costs primarily include the
discontinuance of certain product lines, incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities, the Electronic Data Systems (“EDS”) transition and the reorganization of our European operations discussed below. Management believes the
disclosure of implementation charges provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our Restructuring Program.


In addition, we made $498 million in capital expenditures to implement the Restructuring Program, including $111 million
spent in 2008. Incremental cost savings totaled approximately $283 million in 2008, resulting in cumulative annualized savings under the Restructuring Program of approximately $1,066 million by the end of 2008. Cumulative annualized cost savings
resulting from the Restructuring Program were approximately $783 million by the end of 2007. Refer to Note 6,

Asset

Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs

, for details of our Restructuring Program by segment.

Kraft Europe Reorganization

We are also in the process of
reorganizing our European operations to function on a pan-European centralized category management and value chain model. After the reorganization is complete, the European Principal Company (“EPC”) will manage the European categories
centrally and make decisions for all aspects of the value chain, except for sales and distribution. The European subsidiaries will execute sales and distribution locally, and the local production companies will act as toll manufacturers on behalf of
the EPC. The EPC legal entity has been incorporated as Kraft Foods Europe GmbH in Zurich, Switzerland. As part of the reorganization, we incurred $16 million of restructuring costs, $39 million of implementation costs and $11 million of
non-recurring costs during 2008; $21 million of restructuring costs, $24 million of implementation costs and $10 million of other non-recurring costs during 2007; and $7 million of restructuring costs during 2006. Restructuring and
implementation costs are recorded as part of our overall Restructuring Program. Other costs relating to our Kraft Europe Reorganization are recorded as marketing, administration and research costs. Management believes the disclosure of
implementation and other non-recurring charges provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our Kraft Europe Reorganization.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 28.2% in 2008, 29.8% in 2007 and 22.4% in 2006. Our
effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $242 million from discrete tax events in 2008. Of the total net tax benefits, $29 million related to a reconciliation of our inventory of deferred tax items that resulted in a write-down of our
net deferred tax liabilities in the third quarter, and $42 million related to fourth quarter corrections of state, federal and foreign tax liabilities. The remaining net tax benefits primarily related to the resolution of various tax audits and the
expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. Other discrete tax benefits included the impact from divestitures of a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and several operations in Spain and the tax benefit from impairment
charges taken in 2008. In addition, the 2008 tax rate benefited from foreign earnings taxed below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and from the expected tax benefit on 2008 restructuring expenses. These benefits were only partially
offset by state tax expense and certain foreign tax costs.

Our 2007 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $184 million, primarily
including the effects of dividend repatriation benefits, foreign joint venture earnings and the effect on foreign deferred taxes from lower foreign tax rates enacted in 2007. The 2007 tax rate also benefited from foreign earnings taxed below the
U.S. federal statutory tax rate, an increased domestic manufacturing deduction, and the divestiture of our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks. These benefits were partially offset by state tax expense, tax costs associated
with the divestiture of our hot cereal assets and trademarks and interest income from Altria related to the transfer of our federal tax contingencies.

During 2006, the IRS concluded its examination of Altria’s consolidated tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999. The IRS issued a final Revenue Agents Report on March 15, 2006. Consequently, Altria reimbursed us $337 million
for federal tax reserves that were no longer necessary and $46 million for interest ($29 million net of tax). We also recognized net state tax reversals of $39 million, for a total tax provision benefit of $376 million ($337 million federal plus $39
million state). The total benefit to net earnings that we recognized in 2006 due to the IRS settlement was $405 million, or $0.24 per diluted share. The 2006 tax rate also benefited from the resolution of various tax items in our foreign operations,
dividend repatriation benefits, joint venture earnings, and lower foreign tax rates enacted in 2006 (primarily Canada). These benefits were partially offset by state tax expense and by the tax costs associated with our 2006 divestitures.

As a result of our spin-off, Altria transferred our federal tax contingencies of $375 million to our balance sheet and related interest income of $77 million, or
$0.03 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2007. Following our spin-off from Altria, we are no longer a member of the Altria consolidated tax return group, and we now file our own federal consolidated income tax returns. Although we have taken
steps to mitigate the loss of tax benefits as a result of filing separately, we currently estimate the annual amount of lost tax benefits to be in the range of $50 million to $75 million.


Consolidated Results of Operations

The following discussion compares our consolidated results of operations for 2008 with 2007, and for 2007 with 2006.

Many
factors have an impact on the timing of sales to our customers. These factors include, among others, the timing of holidays and other annual or special events, seasonality, significant weather conditions, timing of our own or customer incentive
programs and pricing actions, customer inventory programs and general economic conditions. Our domestic operating subsidiaries report year-end results as of the Saturday closest to the end of each year, and our international operating subsidiaries
generally report year-end results two weeks prior to the Saturday closest to the end of each year.

2008 compared with 2007:

Net Revenues

– Net revenues increased $6,067 million (16.8%) to $42,201 million in 2008,
due to the following:

Our

LU

Biscuit acquisition was the largest increase to net revenues as no revenues were recorded from it in
the prior year. Furthermore, net revenues increased as we increased pricing to offset higher input costs and investments in our brands. Foreign currency increased net revenues by $725 million, due primarily to the strength of the euro, Brazilian
real, Polish zloty and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Higher base business shipments in our Canada & N.A. Foodservice, Developing Markets and U.S. Convenient Meals segments were more than offset by declines in our remaining
business segments. Total volume increased 3.9%, with 5.7 pp due to our

LU

Biscuit acquisition, net of divestitures.


Operating Income

– Operating income declined $149 million (3.8%) to $3,817 million in 2008, due
to the following (in millions):

Higher pricing outpaced our input cost increases during the year, as we recovered cumulative cost increases from
prior years. The increase in input costs was primarily related to higher raw material costs. The increase in unrealized losses on hedging activities primarily related to energy derivatives, including heating oil (used primarily to hedge
transportation costs) and natural gas contracts. Our

LU

Biscuit acquisition, net of integration costs, increased operating income by $360 million. Total marketing, administration and research costs, as recorded in the consolidated statement
of earnings, increased $1,386 million over the prior year and, excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency and charges for legal matters, increased $266 million over the prior year. The net impact of losses on divestitures
and asset impairments had an unfavorable impact of $127 million on operating income versus the prior year. The charges for legal matters related to certain of our U.S. and European operations, including U.S. coffee operations. Charges for legal
matters were recorded within marketing, administration and research costs. In addition, foreign currency increased operating income by $60 million, due primarily to the strength of the Brazilian real, euro, Polish zloty and Canadian dollar against
the U.S. dollar.

As a result of these changes, operating margin also decreased from 11.0% in 2007 to 9.0% in 2008.


Earnings per Share

– Net earnings of $2,901 million increased by $311 million (12.0%) in 2008.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.92, up 18.5% from $1.62 in 2007, due to the following:


Net Revenues

– Net revenues increased $2,878 million (8.7%) to $36,134 million in 2007, due to
the following:

Our input cost increases outpaced higher pricing. The increase in input costs primarily related to higher raw
material costs, net of $16 million from unrealized gains on hedging activities. Total marketing, administration and research costs, as recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings, increased $553 million over the prior year and, excluding the
impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, increased $333 million over the prior year. The net impact of gains on divestitures and asset impairments had a favorable impact of $202 million on operating income versus the prior year.
The absence of the prior year divestitures decreased operating income $101 million. In addition, foreign currency increased operating income by $121 million, due primarily to the strength of the euro and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar.

As a result of these changes, operating margin also decreased from 12.5% in 2006 to 11.0% in 2007.


Earnings per Share

– Net earnings of $2,590 million decreased by $470 million (15.4%) in 2007.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.62, down 12.4% from $1.85 in 2006, due to the following:

The decrease in operations includes a benefit of $0.05 per diluted share of foreign currency movements.

Results of Operations by Business Segment

We manage
and report operating results through two commercial units, Kraft North America and Kraft International. We manage Kraft North America’s operations by product category, and Kraft International’s operations by geographic location.

Kraft North America’s segments are U.S. Beverages, U.S. Cheese, U.S. Convenient Meals, U.S. Grocery, U.S. Snacks (formerly known as U.S.
Snacks & Cereals) and Canada & North America Foodservice. The two international segments are European Union and Developing Markets.

Effective August 4, 2008, we completed the split-off of the

Post

cereals business. The results of the

Post

cereals business were reflected as discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings and prior
period results were restated in a consistent manner.

In 2008, we implemented a new operating structure. As a result, we began reporting the results of
operations under this new structure in the first quarter of 2008 and restated results from prior periods in a consistent manner. The changes were:

•

U.S. Cheese was organized as a standalone operating segment in order to create a more self-contained and integrated business unit in support of faster growth.

•

Our macaroni and cheese category, as well as other dinner products, were moved from our U.S. Convenient Meals segment to our U.S. Grocery segment to take
advantage of operating synergies.

•

Canada and North America Foodservice were structured as a standalone reportable segment. This change allows us to deliver on the unique requirements of the Canadian
consumer and customer while maintaining strong North American linkages to innovation, new product development and new capabilities to drive our business. Furthermore, it allows us to manage strategic customer decisions and continue to capture
cross-border sales and marketing synergies within our Foodservice operations.


The following discussion compares our results of operations for each of our reportable segments for 2008 with 2007, and
for 2007 with 2006.

As discussed in Note 17,

Segment Reporting

, management uses segment operating income to evaluate segment
performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which
is a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles for all periods presented. In the second quarter of 2008, we began excluding unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities from segment operating income
in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Once realized, the gains and losses on hedging activities are recorded within segment operating results.

In 2008, unrealized losses on hedging activities increased $221 million, due primarily to energy derivatives, including heating oil (used primarily to hedge transportation costs) and natural gas contracts. In
addition, general corporate expenses (which is a component of marketing, administration and research costs) increased $107 million in 2008, primarily due to charges for legal matters related to certain of our U.S. and European operations, including
U.S. coffee operations.

We incurred asset impairment, exit and implementation costs of $1,129 million in 2008, $579 million in 2007 and $1,097 million in
2006. Refer to Note 6,

Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs

, for a breakout of charges by segment.


U.S. Beverages

2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $11 million (0.4%), due to higher net pricing (4.9 pp) and favorable mix (1.7 pp), partially offset by lower volume (3.8 pp) and the impact of divestitures (2.4 pp). Higher net pricing reflected
input cost-driven pricing in coffee and lower promotional spending in ready-to-drink beverages. Favorable mix reflected growth in

Tassimo

. Lower volume was driven by declines in ready-to-drink beverages, primarily

Capri Sun

, partially
offset by gains in powdered beverages, primarily

Country Time

and

Kool-Aid

, and

Maxwell House

mainstream coffee.

Segment operating
income increased $54 million (17.1%), due primarily to higher net pricing, a 2007 asset impairment charge related to our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks, favorable mix and the impact of divestitures, partially offset by
higher raw material costs, lower volume, higher Restructuring Program costs and higher marketing, administration and research costs.

2007 compared with
2006:

Net revenues increased $104 million (3.6%), due to favorable mix (2.5 pp), higher volume (1.8 pp) and higher net pricing (0.9 pp), partially
offset by the impact of divestitures (1.6 pp). Favorable mix from

Crystal Light On the Go

sticks and premium coffee contributed to higher net revenues. Higher volume was driven by ready-to-drink beverages, primarily

Capri Sun

,
partially offset by lower shipments of powdered beverages and

Maxwell House

mainstream coffee. Higher input cost-driven pricing in coffee was partially offset by increased promotional spending in ready-to-drink and powdered beverages.

Segment operating income increased $112 million (54.9%), due primarily to the 2006 loss on the divestiture of a U.S. coffee plant, the 2006 asset
impairment charge related to our

Tassimo

hot beverage system, favorable mix, lower marketing support costs, higher net pricing, higher volume, lower manufacturing costs and lower Restructuring Program costs. These favorable factors were
partially offset by an asset impairment charge related to our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks and higher raw material costs (primarily related to coffee and packaging).

U.S. Cheese


2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $262 million (7.0%), due to higher net pricing (14.1 pp), partially offset by lower volume (6.7 pp) and unfavorable mix (0.4 pp). Higher net pricing reflected input cost-driven pricing, partially offset by increased
promotional spending in our natural cheese category. Lower volume was driven by declines in all of our major cheese categories, partially offset by new product innovations, primarily

Kraft Bagel-fuls

.

Segment operating income increased $222 million (55.5%) due primarily to higher net pricing and lower Restructuring Program costs, partially offset by higher raw
material costs, lower volume, unfavorable mix, higher fixed manufacturing costs and higher marketing, administration and research costs.

2007 compared
with 2006:

Net revenues increased $201 million (5.7%), due to higher net pricing (4.7 pp), favorable mix (0.8) and higher volume (0.2 pp). Higher
net pricing reflected input cost-driven pricing, partially offset by increased promotional spending, primarily in our cultured, snacking cheese and cream cheese categories. Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by new product introductions such
as

Singles Select

cheese slices and

LiveActive

natural and cottage cheese.

Segment operating income decreased $260 million (39.4%), due
primarily to higher raw material costs, higher marketing support costs and higher marketing, administration and research costs. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs and lower
Restructuring Program costs.

U.S. Convenient Meals

2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $335 million (8.6%), due to higher net pricing (5.6 pp), favorable mix (2.2 pp) and higher volume (0.8 pp). Net revenues increased in meats due to higher net pricing, driven by input
cost-driven pricing in sandwich meats,

Lunchables

and hot dogs. Also contributing to meats net revenue growth was higher shipments of bacon, as well as new product introductions, including

Oscar Mayer Deli Creations

sandwiches
(Flatbreads) and

Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh

meats (Shaved Singles and Carved). In pizza, net revenues increased due to higher input cost-driven pricing, net of increased promotional spending, volume growth in

DiGiorno

and

California
Pizza Kitchen

premium brands and the launch of the

For One

product line of individual size pizzas.

Segment operating income increased $12
million (3.1%), due primarily to higher net pricing, favorable mix, higher volume and lower marketing support costs, partially offset by higher input costs (primarily higher raw material costs) and higher marketing, administration and research
costs.

2007 compared with 2006:

Net revenues
increased $208 million (5.6%), due to higher volume (3.4 pp), favorable mix (1.6 pp) and higher net pricing (0.6 pp). Net revenues increased in meat due to higher shipments of sandwich meat, new product introductions and higher input cost-driven
pricing, partially offset by lower shipments of chicken strips due to a first quarter recall. In pizza, net revenues increased due to the introduction of

DiGiorno Ultimate

and higher shipments of

California Pizza Kitchen

products.


Segment operating income decreased $25 million (6.1%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, higher fixed
manufacturing costs, higher marketing support costs and higher marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by lower Restructuring Program charges, higher volume and higher net pricing.

U.S. Grocery

2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $112 million (3.4%), due to higher net pricing (6.2 pp) and favorable mix (0.7 pp), partially offset by lower volume (3.5 pp). Net revenues increased due to higher input cost-driven pricing
across our key categories, primarily spoonable and pourable salad dressings and

Kraft

macaroni and cheese dinners. In addition, net revenues growth was impacted by lower shipments in spoonable and pourable salad dressings, ready-to-eat
desserts and barbecue sauce, which were partially offset by volume gains in

Kraft

macaroni and cheese dinners.

Segment operating income decreased
$10 million (1.0%), due to higher input costs (primarily higher raw material costs), lower volume and higher Restructuring Program costs partially offset by higher net pricing, favorable mix, lower fixed manufacturing costs and lower marketing
support costs.

2007 compared with 2006:

Net revenues
increased $52 million (1.6%), due to favorable mix (2.1 pp) and higher net pricing (2.0 pp), partially offset by the impact of divestitures (1.9 pp) and lower volume (0.6 pp). Favorable mix reflected higher

Kraft

macaroni and cheese dinners
base volume growth and the continued success of

Kraft Easy-Mac

cups. Higher net pricing was driven by input cost-driven pricing partially offset by increased promotional spending, primarily in spoonable salad dressings,

Kraft

macaroni
and cheese dinners and dry packaged desserts. In addition, net revenues growth was impacted by lower shipments in spoonable and pourable salad dressings, dry packaged desserts and barbecue sauce, which were partially offset by volume gains in

Kraft

macaroni and cheese dinners.

Segment operating income decreased $242 million (19.3%), due primarily to the 2006 gain on the divested rice
brand and assets, higher raw material costs, the impact of divestitures, lower volume and higher marketing support costs. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by higher pricing, lower manufacturing costs, lower Restructuring Program
costs and favorable mix.


U.S. Snacks

2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $146 million (3.0%), due to higher net pricing (8.4 pp) and the impact of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition (0.4 pp), partially offset by lower volume (3.1 pp), unfavorable mix (2.5 pp) and the
impact of divestitures (0.2 pp). Biscuits net revenues increased, driven by higher input cost-driven pricing and lower promotional spending, partially offset by unfavorable mix and lower volume. Biscuits unfavorable volume/mix was driven by base
business volume declines in

Wheat Thins, Cheese Nips

and

Chips Ahoy!

, partially offset by gains in

Oreo

cookies as well as new product introductions including

Kraft

macaroni and cheese crackers and

Nilla Cakesters

.
Snack bars net revenues decreased, driven by volume declines in breakfast bars, primarily due to product pruning. Snack nuts net revenues decreased, driven by lower volume, partially offset by higher net pricing.

Segment operating income decreased $77 million (12.7%), due to higher input costs (including higher raw material costs), unfavorable mix, lower volume, higher
Restructuring Program costs, higher marketing, administration and research costs, a 2007 gain on the divestiture of our hot cereal assets and trademarks and the impact of divestitures. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by higher net
pricing, lower fixed manufacturing costs and lower marketing support costs.

2007 compared with 2006:

Net revenues increased $45 million (0.9%), due primarily to favorable mix (2.0 pp) and higher volume (1.6 pp), partially offset by the impact of divestitures (2.6 pp).
Biscuits net revenues increased due to favorable mix and higher shipments in cookies, primarily

Chips Ahoy!

and the introduction of

Oreo Cakesters,

and crackers, primarily

Triscuits

,

Ritz

and

Wheat Thins

. Snack
bars net revenues increased due to new product introductions and continued success of

South Beach Living

bars. Snack nuts net revenues increased due to favorable mix and new product introductions.

Segment operating income increased $163 million (36.7%), due primarily to 2006 asset impairment charges related to the divested pet snacks and hot cereal assets and
trademarks, favorable mix, higher volume, lower input costs (net of higher raw material costs) and lower Restructuring Program costs. These favorable variances were partially offset by the impact of divestitures, higher marketing, administration and
research costs, higher marketing support costs and higher fixed manufacturing costs.

Canada & N.A. Foodservice


2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $214 million (5.2%), due primarily to higher net pricing (3.9 pp), favorable foreign currency (1.3 pp) and higher volume (1.2 pp), partially offset by unfavorable mix (0.9 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.4
pp). In Canada, net revenues growth was primarily driven by volume gains across all retail businesses, favorable foreign currency and higher net pricing. In N.A. Foodservice, net revenues increased, primarily driven by higher input cost-driven
pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix.

Segment operating income increased $34 million (8.4%), due primarily to higher net pricing, lower
manufacturing costs, lower marketing, administration and research costs, higher volume and favorable foreign currency. These favorable variances were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher Restructuring Program costs and higher
marketing support costs.

2007 compared with 2006:

Net
revenues increased $206 million (5.3%), due to higher net pricing (3.9 pp), favorable currency (3.0 pp) and favorable mix (0.3 pp), partially offset by the impact of divestitures (1.6 pp) and lower volume (0.3 pp). In Canada, net revenues
growth was primarily driven by volume gains, across all retail business except for Convenient Meals, higher net pricing and favorable foreign currency. In N.A. Foodservice, net revenues increased, primarily driven by higher input cost-driven pricing
and favorable foreign currency, partially offset by lower volume due to the discontinuation of lower margin product lines and unfavorable mix.

Segment
operating income decreased $22 million (5.2%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, higher marketing, administration and research costs, higher Restructuring Program costs and the impact of divestitures. These unfavorable variances were
partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, favorable foreign currency, favorable mix and a 2006 loss on the divestiture of industrial coconut assets.

European Union

2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $3,308 million (41.6%), due to the impact of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition (34.5 pp), favorable foreign currency (6.4 pp), higher net pricing (4.5 pp) and favorable mix (0.6 pp), partially
offset by the impact of divestitures (3.3 pp) and lower volume (1.1 pp). Higher input cost-driven pricing was partially offset by higher promotional spending. Lower volume was driven by declines in coffee and cheese, partially offset by gains in
chocolate.

Segment operating income decreased $157 million (27.6%), due primarily to higher input costs (primarily higher raw material costs), higher
Restructuring Program costs, the net loss on the divestitures of several operations in Spain, asset impairment charges related to certain international intangible assets and the divestiture of our Nordic and Baltic snacks operation, higher
marketing, administration and research costs, lower volume, higher fixed manufacturing costs and the impact of divestitures. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by higher net pricing, the impact of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition
(net of associated integration costs), favorable mix, lower marketing support costs and favorable foreign currency.


2007 compared with 2006:

Net revenues increased $1,282 million (19.2%), due to favorable currency (10.5 pp), the impact of the UB acquisition (3.5 pp), higher volume (3.5 pp), favorable mix (1.9 pp) and the impact of divestitures (1.4 pp), partially offset by
lower net pricing (1.6 pp). Volume related growth and favorable mix were driven by premium chocolate, due to new product introductions and promotional activities, and higher shipments in mainstream coffee and cheese. Lower net pricing reflects
higher promotional spending in chocolate, cheese and coffee (primarily in Germany).

Segment operating income increased $22 million (4.0%), due primarily
to higher volume, the 2006 asset impairment charge related to our

Tassimo

hot beverage system, lower manufacturing costs, lower Restructuring Program costs, favorable currency and the impact of the UB acquisition. These favorable variances
were partially offset by the 2006 gain on the redemption of our UB investment, higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, higher marketing, administration and research costs and higher marketing support costs.

Developing Markets

2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $1,679 million (31.6%), due to higher net pricing (11.8 pp), the impact of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition (10.1 pp), favorable mix (4.5 pp), favorable foreign currency (3.4 pp),
favorable resolution of a Brazilian value added tax claim (1.3 pp) and higher volume (0.5 pp). In Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa, net revenues increased, driven by higher net pricing across the region, volume growth in chocolate,
biscuits and coffee categories, our

LU

Biscuit acquisition and favorable foreign currency. In Latin America, net revenues increased, driven by favorable foreign currency, higher net pricing, favorable resolution of a value added tax claim and
favorable volume/mix in Brazil; higher net pricing and favorable mix in Argentina; and higher net pricing and favorable mix in Venezuela. In Asia Pacific, net revenues increased due primarily to our

LU

Biscuit acquisition, higher net pricing
across the region and favorable foreign currency.

Segment operating income increased $111 million (23.4%) due to higher net pricing, favorable mix,
favorable resolution of a Brazilian value added tax claim, favorable foreign currency, the impact of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition (net of associated integrations costs) and favorable volume. These favorable variances were partially offset by
higher input costs (including higher raw material costs), higher marketing, administration and research costs, higher Restructuring Program costs, higher marketing support costs, 2008 asset impairment charges related to certain international
intangible assets, a juice operation in Brazil and a cheese plant in Australia, higher fixed manufacturing costs and a 2007 gain on the divestiture of our sugar confectionery assets in Romania and related trademarks.

2007 compared with 2006:

Net revenues increased $780 million
(17.2%), due primarily to favorable currency (5.5 pp), higher net pricing (5.1 pp), higher volume (4.0 pp), and favorable mix (2.5 pp). In Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa, net revenues increased due to higher pricing and growth in
coffee and chocolate in Russia, Romania and Ukraine, and in refreshment beverages and snacks for the Middle East & Africa region. In Latin America, net revenues increased due to higher pricing and favorable volume/mix, particularly in
Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. In Asia Pacific, net revenues increased due to volume growth in China and Southeast Asia.

Segment operating income
increased $71 million (17.6%), due primarily to higher pricing, higher volume, lower Restructuring Program costs, favorable mix, favorable currency, a 2006 asset impairment charge related to intangible assets in Egypt and a 2007 gain on the
divestiture of our sugar confectionery assets in Romania and related trademarks. These favorable variances were partially offset by higher input costs (including higher raw material costs), higher marketing, administration and research costs, higher
marketing support costs and higher fixed manufacturing costs.


Critical Accounting Policies

Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial
statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies we
used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include Kraft, as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. Our domestic operating subsidiaries report year-end results as of the Saturday closest to the end of
each year, and our international operating subsidiaries generally report year-end results two weeks prior to the Saturday closest to the end of each year.

We account for investments in which we exercise significant influence (20% – 50% ownership interest) under the equity method of accounting. We account for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20% and do
not exercise significant influence by the cost method of accounting. All intercompany transactions were eliminated.

Use of Estimates:

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which require
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our financial statements. Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, pension and benefit plan assumptions, lives and valuation
assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, marketing programs and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the
revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method is used to cost a majority of domestic inventories. The cost of other inventories is principally determined by the average cost method.
We used the LIFO method to determine the cost of 35% of inventories at December 31, 2008 and 37% of inventories at December 31, 2007. The stated LIFO amounts of inventories were $152 million lower at December 31, 2008 and
$142 million lower at December 31, 2007 than the current cost of inventories. We also record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes.

Long-Lived Assets:

We review long-lived assets, including
amortizable intangible assets, for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing
assets held for use for impairment, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment
losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, requires us to test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets at least annually
for impairment. We have recognized goodwill in our reporting units, which are generally one level below our operating segments. We use a two step process to test goodwill at the reporting unit level. The first step involves a comparison of the
estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on planned growth rates, estimates of discount rates and residual values. If the carrying value
exceeds the fair value, the second step of the process is necessary. The second step measures the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. To test non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment, we compare the fair
value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. Fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets is determined using our planned revenue growth rates, estimates of discount rates and royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the
intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. Definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.


Effective October 1, 2007, we adopted a new accounting policy to perform our annual impairment review of goodwill
and non-amortizable intangible assets as of October 1 of each year. The change in our testing date was made to align it with the revised timing of our annual strategic planning process implemented in 2007. Prior to that change, we performed our
annual impairment reviews as of January 1 of each year.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed the annual review of goodwill and
non-amortizable intangible assets and recorded a $44 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands, France and Puerto Rico. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and
estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic conditions. During our 2008 impairment review, it was determined that our Kraft Biscuit Europe reporting unit was the most sensitive to near-term changes in our discounted cash flow
assumptions, as it contains a significant portion of the goodwill recorded upon our 2007 acquisition of

LU

Biscuit. In 2007, due to the change in our testing date, we completed two reviews of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets:
during the first quarter as of January 1 and during the fourth quarter as of October 1. We found no impairments during these reviews of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets. During the first quarter of 2006, we completed our
annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and recorded a $24 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in Egypt and our hot cereal intangible assets in the U.S. These charges were included within asset impairment
and exit costs.

Insurance and Self-Insurance:

We use
a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and our obligation for employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with
the risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions.

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods. Revenues are recorded net of consumer
incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers. Kraft’s shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. A provision for product returns and allowances for bad debts are
also recorded as a reduction to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized.

Marketing Costs:

We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store
display incentives and volume-based incentives. We expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on
amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer incentive expenses are
charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated volume and related expense for the full year. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year
incurred.

Environmental Costs:

We are subject to laws
and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are adjusted as new information
develops or circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. As of December 31, 2008, our subsidiaries were involved in 67 active Superfund
and other similar actions in the U.S. related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability.

Based on
information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results.
However, we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation actions.

Employee Benefit
Plans:

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

(“SFAS No. 158”). SFAS No. 158 required us to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date beginning in 2008. We previously measured our
non-U.S. pension plans (other than certain Canadian and French pension plans) at September 30 of each year. On December 31, 2008, we recorded an


after-tax decrease of $8 million to retained earnings using the 15-month approach to proportionally allocate the transition adjustment required upon adoption
of the measurement provision of SFAS No. 158. The plan assets and benefit obligations of our pension plans and the benefit obligations of our postretirement plans are now all measured at year-end.

We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees. These include pension plans, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits,
consisting primarily of severance. We record amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP. These calculations require the use of various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan
assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. As permitted by
U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize any effect of the modifications over future periods. We believe that the assumptions used in recording our plan obligations are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries. Refer to Note 11,

Benefit Plans

, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used.

We recorded the following amounts in earnings for
these employee benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006:


Our 2009 discount rate assumption remained unchanged at 6.10% for our U.S. postretirement plans and increased to 7.60%
from 5.80% for our Canadian plans. Our 2009 discount rate decreased to 6.10% from 6.30% for our U.S. pension plans. We model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected
future cash flows of the benefit obligations. Our 2009 discount rate assumption for our non-U.S. pension plans increased to 6.41% from 5.44%. We developed the discount rates for our non-U.S. plans from local bond indices that match local benefit
obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year.

Our 2009 expected
rate of return on plan assets remained unchanged at 8.00% for our U.S. pension plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and
estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. We attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments. We intend to rebalance our plan
portfolios by mid-2009 by making contributions and monthly benefit payments.

While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2009 assumptions for our
U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rate or a fifty-basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, (reduction) /
increase in cost, as of December 31, 2008:

Financial Instruments:

As Kraft operates globally, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk
management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain foreign currency and commodity price risk
management strategies that seek to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, principally through the use of derivative instruments.

Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at
inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions
and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each
forecasted transaction will occur. If we deem it probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, we recognize the gain or loss in earnings currently.

By using derivatives to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and commodity prices, Kraft has exposure on these derivatives to credit and market risk. We are exposed to credit risk that the counterparty might fail to fulfill its
performance obligations under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each
counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. In October 2008, one of our counterparties, Lehman Brothers Commercial Corporation, filed for bankruptcy. Consequently, we wrote off an insignificant asset related to
derivatives held with them. This did not have a significant impact on our foreign currency risk management program. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration greater than
one year be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity
prices, or interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that may be
undertaken by the use of derivative instruments.


We record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either current assets or
current liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period either in accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) or in earnings, depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a
hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. Gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) are reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods
in which operating results are affected by the hedged item. Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Income Taxes:

We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS
No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. Prior to our spin-off from Altria, we were included in Altria’s consolidated federal income tax return. We generally computed income taxes on a separate company basis; however, some of our
foreign tax credits, capital losses and other credits could not be used on a separate company basis. To the extent that Altria used our foreign tax credits and other tax benefits in its consolidated federal income tax return, we recognized the
benefit in the calculation of our provision for income taxes. This benefit was approximately $270 million in 2007 (both through the date of our spin-off as well as post-spin carryback claims to pre-spin periods) and $195 million in 2006. We
made payments to, or were reimbursed by, Altria for the tax effects resulting from being included in Altria’s tax return. As of March 31, 2007, we are no longer a member of the Altria consolidated tax return group and we now file our own
federal consolidated income tax returns.

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for the Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”). We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies when tax benefits should be recorded in the financial statements and provides
measurement criteria for valuing such benefits. In order for us to recognize benefits, our tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon audit. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater
than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Before the implementation of FIN 48, we established additional provisions for certain positions that were likely to be challenged even though we believe that those existing tax
positions were fully supportable. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in an increase to shareholders’ equity as of January 1, 2007 of $213 million.

We recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or
all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Commodity Trends

We are a major purchaser of dairy, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn products, soybean and vegetable oils, nuts, meat products, and sugar and other sweeteners. We also use significant quantities of plastic, glass and
cardboard to package our products, and natural gas for our factories and warehouses. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production.

We purchase our dairy raw material requirements, including milk and cheese, from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and
independent processors. The prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by market supply and demand, as well as by government programs. Dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007. Significant
cost items in our biscuit and grocery products are grains (wheat, corn and soybean oil). Grain costs have experienced significant increases as a result of burgeoning global demand for food, livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.
Grain costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007. The most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans, which are purchased on world markets. Green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply,
changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products. Green coffee bean costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007. A significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products
is cocoa, which is purchased on world markets, and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the British pound and the U.S. dollar relative to certain other currencies. Cocoa bean and cocoa
butter costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007.

During 2008, our aggregate commodity costs rose significantly as a result of higher dairy,
coffee, cocoa, wheat, nuts, meat products, soybean oil and packaging costs. For 2008, our commodity costs were approximately $1.8 billion higher than 2007, following an increase of approximately $1.3 billion in 2007 compared to 2006. Overall, we
expect commodity costs to moderately increase in 2009.


Liquidity

We
believe that our cash from operations, our existing $4.5 billion revolving credit facility (which supports our commercial paper program), and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs
(including the remaining cash requirements of the Restructuring Program), planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, authorized share repurchases, and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. Despite recent market
conditions, we continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines for daily funding requirements. We also use short-term intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility, which have been made
more feasible by recent, temporary U.S. tax law changes. Overall, we do not foresee any impact to funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:

Operating activities provided net cash of $4.1 billion in 2008,
$3.6 billion in 2007 and $3.7 billion in 2006. Operating cash flows increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to increased earnings and working capital improvements (mainly from lower income tax payments and lower inventory levels),
partially offset by increased interest paid. The increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by the $305 million tax transfer from Altria in 2007 for the federal tax contingencies held by them, less the impact of federal reserves reversed
due to the adoption of FIN 48. The transfer from Altria was reflected within other in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

The decrease in 2007
operating cash flows from 2006 was due primarily to the $405 million tax reimbursement from Altria in 2006 related to the closure of a tax audit and increased marketing, administration and research costs. This decrease in operating cash flows was
partially offset by the $305 million tax transfer from Altria discussed above and lower working capital of $225 million primarily due to lower income tax payments.

We anticipate making U.S. pension contributions of approximately $220 million in 2009 and non-U.S. pension contributions of approximately $170 million in 2009. We expect to fund these contributions from operations.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities:

One element of our growth
strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolios and / or expand our geographic reach through disciplined programs of selective acquisitions and divestitures. We are regularly reviewing potential acquisition candidates and from time to time sell
businesses to accelerate the shift in our portfolio toward businesses - whether global, regional or local - that offer us a sustainable competitive advantage. The impact of future acquisitions or divestitures could have a material impact on our
cash flows.

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.3 billion during 2008, $8.4 billion during 2007 and $116 million during 2006. The
decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2008 primarily related to lower payments for acquisitions, partially offset by lower proceeds from divestitures and higher capital expenditures. During 2008, we paid Groupe Danone S.A. $99 million to
refund excess cash received in the acquisition of

LU

Biscuit. Additionally, we received $153 million in net proceeds on divestitures, primarily related to a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and four operations in Spain, and we disbursed $56
million for transaction fees related to the split-off of the

Post

cereals business.

On November 30, 2007, we acquired

LU

Biscuit for
€5.1 billion (approximately $7.6 billion) in cash. Additionally, during 2007, we received proceeds of $216 million from the divestitures of our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks, our sugar confectionery assets in
Romania and related trademarks and our hot cereal assets and trademarks. During 2006, we received proceeds of $946 million from the divestitures of our rice brand and assets, pet snacks brand and assets, industrial coconut assets, certain Canadian
assets, a U.S. biscuit brand and a U.S. coffee plant.

Capital expenditures, which were funded by operating activities, were $1.4 billion in 2008 and $1.2
billion in 2007 and 2006. The 2008 capital expenditures were primarily used to modernize manufacturing facilities, implement the Restructuring Program, and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2009 capital expenditures to be
in line with 2008 expenditures, including capital expenditures required for systems investments. We expect to fund these expenditures from operations.

Net Cash (Used in) / Provided by Financing Activities:

Net cash used in financing activities was $2.1 billion during 2008 and $3.7 billion
during 2006, compared with $5.1 billion provided during 2007. The net cash used in financing activities in 2008 primarily related to $5.9 billion in payments made on the bridge facility used to fund our

LU

Biscuit acquisition, $1.7 billion in
dividends paid, $777 million in Common Stock share


repurchases and $795 million in long-term debt repayments, primarily related to debt that matured on October 1, 2008, partially offset by $6.9 billion
in proceeds from our long-term debt offerings. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 was primarily due to $6.4 billion in proceeds from long-term debt offerings and net outstanding borrowings of $5.5 billion under the bridge facility
used to fund our

LU

Biscuit acquisition, partially offset by $3.7 billion in Common Stock share repurchases, $1.6 billion in dividends paid and a $1.5 billion repayment of long-term debt that matured. The net cash used in financing activities
in 2006 primarily related to $1.6 billion in dividends paid, $1.3 billion in long-term debt repaid and $1.3 billion in Common Stock share repurchases.

In
November 2009, $750 million of our long-term debt matures. We expect to fund the repayment through the issuance of commercial paper or long-term debt.

Borrowing Arrangements:

We maintain a revolving credit facility that we have historically used for general corporate purposes and to
support our commercial paper issuances. The $4.5 billion, multi-year revolving credit facility expires in April 2010. No amounts have been drawn on this facility. In October 2008, one of the syndicate banks under our credit facility, Lehman
Commercial Paper, Inc., filed for bankruptcy protection. Lehman’s commitment under our credit facility is approximately $136 million. We do not expect to replace them, and our capacity under our credit facility will accordingly be reduced to
approximately $4.4 billion. We do not expect this to have a current or future effect on our liquidity.

We must maintain a net worth of at least
$20.0 billion under the terms of our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2008, our net worth was $22.2 billion. We expect to continue to meet this covenant. The revolving credit facility has no other financial covenants, credit
rating triggers or provisions that could require us to post collateral as security.

In addition to the above, some of our international subsidiaries
maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet short-term working capital needs. Collectively, these credit lines amounted to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2008. Borrowings on these lines amounted to $291 million at December 31,
2008 and $250 million at December 31, 2007.

At December 31, 2007, we had borrowed €3.8 billion (approximately $5.5 billion) under the
364-day bridge facility agreement we used to acquire

LU

Biscuit (“

LU

Biscuit Bridge Facility”). Under the terms of the credit agreement, we were required to repay borrowings with the net cash proceeds from debt offerings
having a maturity of greater than one year. As such, we repaid the €3.8 billion (approximately $5.9 billion at the time of repayments) with proceeds from our March 20, 2008 and May 22, 2008 debt issuances discussed below. Upon
repayment, this facility was terminated.

Debt:

Our
total debt was $20.3 billion at December 31, 2008 and $21.0 billion at December 31, 2007. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.48 at December 31, 2008 and 0.43 at December 31, 2007.

On December 19, 2008, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes; on May 22, 2008, we issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes; and on
March 20, 2008, we issued €2.85 billion (approximately $4.5 billion) of senior unsecured notes. We used the net proceeds from these issuances ($498 million in December, $1,967 million in May and approximately $4,470 million
in March) for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under our

LU

Biscuit Bridge Facility and other short-term borrowings.

On October 1, 2008, we repaid $700 million in notes. This repayment was primarily financed from commercial paper issuances.

In December
2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration on Form S-3 with the SEC. As a well-known seasoned issuer, we are able to register new debt securities in amounts authorized by our Board of Directors through December 2010. Our Board of Directors
authorized $5.0 billion in long-term financing, which was in addition to the €5.3 billion authorized for the

LU

Biscuit acquisition.

In
December 2007, we issued $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes under the shelf registration. We used the net proceeds from the offering ($2,966 million) for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper and a
portion of our

LU

Biscuit Bridge Facility.

In August 2007, we issued $3.5 billion of senior unsecured notes, which was the remainder of the
capacity under our former Form S-3 shelf registration statement on file with the SEC. We used the net proceeds from the offering ($3,462 million) for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper.


The notes from all issuances discussed above include covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt secured by liens
above a certain threshold. We are also required to offer to purchase these notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, if we experience both of the following:

(i)

a “change of control” triggering event, and

(ii)

a downgrade of these notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch, Inc. within
a specified period.

We expect to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to Note 7,

Debt and Borrowing
Arrangements

, for further details of these debt offerings.

We refinance long-term and short-term debt from time to time. The nature and amount of our
long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately $3.0 billion remaining in long-term financing
authority from our Board of Directors.

Credit Ratings:

At December 31, 2008, our debt ratings by major credit rating agencies were:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than the guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.

Guarantees:

As discussed in Note 13,

Commitments and
Contingencies

, we have third-party guarantees because of our acquisition, divestiture and construction activities. As part of those transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At
December 31, 2008, the maximum potential payments under our third-party guarantees were $43 million, of which $8 million have no specified expiration dates. Substantially all of the remainder expire at various times through 2018. The
carrying amounts of these guarantees were $38 million on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008.

In addition, at December 31, 2008,
we were contingently liable for $186 million of guarantees related to our own performance. These include letters of credit related to dairy commodity purchases and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes, and other letters of
credit.

Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.


Aggregate Contractual Obligations:

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2008:

(1)

Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include unamortized bond premiums or discounts.

(2)

Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using a LIBOR rate forward
curve analysis as of December 31, 2008. Interest calculated on our euro notes was forecasted using the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2008. An insignificant amount of interest expense was excluded from the table for a
portion of our foreign debt due to the complexities involved in forecasting expected interest payments.

(3)

Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our capital leases, including the expected cash payments of interest expense of approximately $22 million on our capital leases.

(4)

Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.

(5)

Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution)
are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are
considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a
significant penalty, and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.

(6)

Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2018 of $2,290 million. We
are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2018; as such, they are excluded from the above table. In addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above:
accrued pension costs, income taxes, minority interest, insurance accruals and other accruals. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments (or contributions beyond 2009, in the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. We
currently expect to make approximately $390 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2009. We also expect that our net pension cost will increase by approximately $200 million to approximately $440 million in 2009. As of
December 31, 2008, our total liability for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions and associated accrued interest and penalties, was $1,075 million. We expect to pay approximately $104 million in the next 12 months. While years 2000
through 2003 are currently under examination by the IRS, we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of this and other tax audit outcomes.


Equity and Dividends

Stock Repurchases:

Our Board of Directors authorized the following Common Stock repurchase programs. We are not obligated to repurchase any
of our Common Stock and may suspend our current program at our discretion. The total repurchases under these programs were 25.3 million shares for $777 million in 2008, 110.1 million shares for $3,640 million in 2007 and 38.7 million
shares for $1,250 million in 2006. We made these repurchases of our Common Stock in open market transactions.

As of December 31, 2008, we had $723 million remaining under our $5.0 billion share repurchase authority.
Given the present environment, we do not expect to make further share repurchases before the current program authority expires on March 30, 2009.

In
March 2007, we repurchased 1.4 million additional shares of our Common Stock from Altria at a cost of $46.5 million. We paid $32.085 per share, which was the average of the high and the low price of Kraft Common Stock as reported on the NYSE on
March 1, 2007. This repurchase was in accordance with our Altria spin-off agreement.

Stock Plans:

Beginning in 2008, we changed our annual and long-term incentive compensation programs to further align them with shareholder returns. Under the annual incentive program,
we now grant equity in the form of both restricted or deferred stock and stock options. The restricted or deferred stock will continue to vest 100% after three years, and the stock options will vest one-third each year beginning on the first
anniversary of the grant date. Additionally, we changed our long-term incentive plan from a cash-based program to a share-based program. These shares vest based on varying performance, market and service conditions.

In January 2008, we granted 1.4 million shares of stock in connection with our long-term incentive plan. The market value per share was $32.26 on the date of grant.
The unvested shares have no voting rights and do not pay dividends.

In February 2008, as part of our annual incentive program, we issued 3.4 million
shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The market value per restricted or deferred share was $29.49 on the date of grant. Also, as part of our annual incentive program, we granted 13.5 million stock
options to eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees at an exercise price of $29.49.

In addition, we also issued 0.2 million off-cycle shares of
restricted and deferred stock during 2008. The weighted-average market value per restricted or deferred share was $30.38 on the date of grant. In aggregate, we issued 5.0 million restricted and deferred shares during 2008, including those
issued as part of our long-term incentive plan. We also granted 0.1 million off-cycle stock options during 2008 at an exercise price of $30.78. In aggregate, we granted 13.6 million stock options during 2008.

At December 31, 2008, the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options, vesting of non-U.S. deferred shares and vesting of long-term
incentive plan shares was 44.5 million or 3.0% of total shares outstanding.


Our Board of Directors approved a stock option grant to our Chief Executive Officer on May 3, 2007, to recognize her
election as our Chairman. She received 300,000 stock options under the 2005 Performance Incentive Plan, which vest under varying market and service conditions and expire ten years after the grant date.

In January 2007, we issued 5.2 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees as part of our annual incentive program. The
market value per restricted or deferred share was $34.655 on the date of grant. Additionally, we issued 1.0 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2007. The weighted-average market value per restricted or deferred
share was $34.085 on the date of grant. The total number of restricted and deferred shares issued in 2007 was 9.2 million, including those issued as a result of our spin-off from Altria (discussed below).

Upon our spin-off, Altria stock awards were modified through the issuance of Kraft stock awards, and accordingly, the Altria stock awards were split into two
instruments. Holders of Altria stock options received: 1) a new Kraft option to acquire shares of Kraft Common Stock; and 2) an adjusted Altria stock option for the same number of shares of Altria common stock previously held, but with a
proportionally reduced exercise price. For each employee stock option outstanding, the aggregate intrinsic value immediately after our spin-off from Altria was not greater than the aggregate intrinsic value immediately prior to it. Holders of Altria
restricted stock or stock rights awarded before January 31, 2007, retained their existing awards and received restricted stock or stock rights in Kraft Common Stock. Recipients of Altria restricted stock or stock rights awarded on or after
January 31, 2007, did not receive Kraft restricted stock or stock rights because Altria had announced the spin-off at that time. We reimbursed Altria $179 million for net settlement of the employee stock awards. We determined the fair value of
the stock options using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, and adjusted the fair value of the restricted stock and stock rights by the value of projected forfeitures.

Based upon the number of Altria stock awards outstanding upon our spin-off, we granted stock options for 24.2 million shares of Common Stock at a weighted-average price of $15.75. The options expire between 2007
and 2012. In addition, we issued 3.0 million shares of restricted stock and stock rights. The market value per restricted share or right was $31.66 on the date of grant. Restrictions on the majority of these restricted stock and stock rights
lapse in either the first quarter of 2008 or 2009.

Dividends:

We paid dividends of $1,663 million in 2008 and $1,638 million in 2007. The 1.5% increase reflects a higher dividend rate in 2008, partially offset by a lower number of shares outstanding because of share repurchases and the split-off of
the

Post

cereals business. During the third quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors approved a 7.4% increase in the current quarterly dividend rate to $0.29 per share on our Common Stock. As a result, the present annualized dividend rate is
$1.16 per common share. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that
our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.

2009 Outlook

We now expect 2009 diluted EPS of $1.88 versus a previous expectation of at least $2.00. This change reflects a greater-than-anticipated negative impact from currency
and pension costs, significantly offset by improved business performance.

Our 2009 guidance reflects expectations of approximately $0.16 in negative
impact from currency versus the prior year, $0.08 in higher pension costs and $0.03 in year-over-year dilution from the exit of the

Post

cereals business. In addition, we expect a $0.09 impact from spending on cost savings initiatives in 2009
and a tax rate of approximately 31.5 percent, up from 2008, which benefited from several discrete items.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

As
Kraft operates globally, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program
focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain foreign currency and commodity price risk management
policies that principally use derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future
purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes. Refer to Note 1,

Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies,

and Note 12,

Financial Instruments

, to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our foreign currency and commodity price risk management policies and the types of derivative instruments
we use to hedge those exposures.

In October 2008, one of our counterparties, Lehman Brothers Commercial Corporation, filed for bankruptcy. Consequently,
we wrote off an insignificant asset related to derivatives held with them. This did not have a significant impact on our foreign currency risk management program.

Value at Risk:

We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our
interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our foreign currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. We included our debt; short-term investments; foreign
currency forwards, swaps and options; and commodity futures, forwards and options in our VAR computation. Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the
abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the computation.

We made the VAR estimates assuming normal market conditions, using a
95% confidence interval. We used a “variance / co-variance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate
and forward currency rate movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of
foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity, and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.

The estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, under normal market conditions and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our
foreign currency and commodity instruments under normal market conditions, as calculated in the VAR model, were (in millions):

This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss
from adverse movements in interest rates, foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by Kraft, nor does it consider the effect
of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that
future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies:

Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation:

Kraft Foods Inc. was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Kraft Foods Inc., through its subsidiaries (Kraft Foods Inc. and subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as “Kraft,”
“we,” “us” and “our”), manufactures and markets packaged foods and beverages in approximately 150 countries.

Prior to
June 13, 2001, Kraft was a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”). On June 13, 2001, we completed an initial public offering of 280,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock (“Common Stock”)
at a price of $31.00 per share.

In the first quarter of 2007, Altria spun off its remaining interest (89.0%) in Kraft on a pro rata basis to Altria
stockholders in a tax-free transaction. Effective as of the close of business on March 30, 2007, all Kraft shares owned by Altria were distributed to Altria’s stockholders, and our separation from Altria was completed.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements
include Kraft, as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. Our domestic operating subsidiaries report year-end results as of the Saturday closest to the end of each year, and our international operating subsidiaries generally report
year-end results two weeks prior to the Saturday closest to the end of each year.

We account for investments in which we exercise significant influence
(20%-50% ownership interest) under the equity method of accounting. We account for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20% and do not exercise significant influence by the cost method of accounting. Minority interest in
subsidiaries consists of the equity interest of minority investors in consolidated subsidiaries of Kraft. Kraft’s consolidated minority interest expense, net of taxes, was $9 million in 2008, $3 million in 2007 and $5 million in 2006. All
intercompany transactions were eliminated.

Use of Estimates:

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our financial statements.
Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, pension and benefit plan assumptions, lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, marketing programs and income taxes. We base our
estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known.
Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Foreign Currencies:

We translate the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries using average exchange rates
during each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of each period. We record currency translation adjustments as a component of shareholders’ equity. Transaction gains and losses are recorded in
earnings and were not significant for any of the periods presented.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
The last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method is used to cost a majority of domestic inventories. The cost of other inventories is principally determined by the average cost method. We also record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete
inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes.

Long-Lived Assets:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from
3 to 20 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 40 years.


We review long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment when conditions exist that indicate
the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing assets held for use for impairment, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest
level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be
received, less costs of disposal.

Software Costs:

We
capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, requires us to test goodwill and
non-amortizable intangible assets at least annually for impairment. We have recognized goodwill in our reporting units, which are generally one level below our operating segments. We use a two step process to test goodwill at the reporting unit
level. The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on planned growth rates, estimates of discount
rates and residual values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the second step of the process is necessary. The second step measures the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. To test non-amortizable
intangible assets for impairment, we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. Fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets is determined using our planned revenue growth rates, estimates of discount rates and
royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. Definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

Effective October 1, 2007, we adopted a new accounting policy to perform our annual impairment review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets as of
October 1 of each year. The change in our testing date was made to align it with the revised timing of our annual strategic planning process implemented in 2007. Prior to that change, we performed our annual impairment reviews as of
January 1 of each year.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed the annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and
recorded a $44 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands, France and Puerto Rico. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans,
industry and economic conditions. During our 2008 impairment review, it was determined that our Kraft Biscuit Europe reporting unit was the most sensitive to near-term changes in our discounted cash flow assumptions, as it contains a significant
portion of the goodwill recorded upon our 2007 acquisition of the global

LU

biscuit business of Groupe Danone S.A. (“

LU

Biscuit”). In 2007, due to the change in our testing date, we completed two reviews of goodwill and
non-amortizable intangible assets: during the first quarter as of January 1 and during the fourth quarter as of October 1. We found no impairments during these reviews of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets. During the first
quarter of 2006, we completed our annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and recorded a $24 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in Egypt and our hot cereal intangible assets in the U.S. These charges were
included within asset impairment and exit costs.

Insurance and Self-Insurance:

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and our obligation for employee healthcare
benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions.

Revenue
Recognition:

We recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods. Revenues
are recorded net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers. Kraft’s shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. A provision for product returns and
allowances for bad debts are also recorded as a reduction to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized.


Marketing, Administration and Research Costs:

Marketing

– We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and
volume-based incentives. We expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as
being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as
a percentage of volume, based on estimated volume and related expense for the full year. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Advertising expense
was $1,639 million in 2008, $1,471 million in 2007 and $1,308 million in 2006.

Research

– We expense costs as incurred for product research
and development. Research and development expense was $499 million in 2008, $442 million in 2007 and $414 million in 2006.

Environmental Costs:

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an
undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when
their receipt is deemed probable. As of December 31, 2008, our subsidiaries were involved in 67 active Superfund and other similar actions in the U.S. related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we
retain liability.

Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our
compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results. However, we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation
actions.

Employee Benefit Plans:

In
September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

(“SFAS No. 158”). SFAS
No. 158 requires us to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date beginning in 2008. We previously measured our non-U.S. pension plans (other than certain Canadian and French pension plans) at September 30 of
each year. On December 31, 2008, we recorded an after-tax decrease of $8 million to retained earnings using the 15-month approach to proportionally allocate the transition adjustment required upon adoption of the measurement provision of SFAS
No. 158. The plan assets and benefit obligations of our pension plans and the benefit obligations of our postretirement plans are now all measured at year-end.

We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees. These include pension plans, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits, consisting primarily of severance. We provide
pension coverage for certain employees of our non-U.S. subsidiaries through separate plans. Local statutory requirements govern many of these plans. For certain employees hired in the U.S. after January 1, 2009, we have discontinued benefits
under our U.S. pension plans, and we have replaced it with an enhanced company contribution to our employee savings plan. Our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries provide health care and other benefits to most retired employees. Local government plans
generally cover health care benefits for retirees outside the U.S. and Canada. Our postemployment benefit plans cover most salaried and certain hourly employees. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered
employees.

Financial Instruments:

As Kraft operates
globally, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain foreign currency and commodity price risk management strategies that seek
to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, principally through the use of derivative instruments.

Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at
inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for


undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant
characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur. If we deem it probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, we
recognize the gain or loss in earnings currently.

By using derivatives to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and commodity prices, Kraft has
exposure on these derivatives to credit and market risk. We are exposed to credit risk that the counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize our credit risk by entering into
transactions with high quality counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. In October 2008, one of our
counterparties, Lehman Brothers Commercial Corporation, filed for bankruptcy. Consequently, we wrote off an insignificant asset related to derivatives held with them. This did not have a significant impact on our foreign currency risk management
program. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration greater than one year be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk is
the risk that the value of the financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk
management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that may be undertaken by the use of derivative instruments.

We record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either current assets or current liabilities. Cash flows from hedging
instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Commodity cash flow hedges

– We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. Accordingly, we use commodity forward contracts as cash flow hedges, primarily for meat, coffee, dairy, sugar, cocoa
and wheat. Commodity forward contracts generally qualify for the normal purchase exception under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, (“SFAS No. 133”) and are, therefore, not subject
to its provisions. We use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including dairy, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn products, soybean oils, meat products, sugar, natural gas and heating oil. Some of these derivative
instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure.
We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.

For those derivative instruments
that are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133, we defer the effective portion of unrealized gains and losses on commodity futures and option contracts as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
earnings / (losses). We recognize the deferred portion as a component of cost of sales when the related inventory is sold. Ineffectiveness is directly recorded as a component of cost of sales. For the derivative instruments that we considered
economic hedges but did not designate for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133, we recognize gains and losses directly as a component of cost of sales.

Foreign currency cash flow hedges

– We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. These
instruments include forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro,
Swiss franc, British pound and Canadian dollar.

For those derivative instruments that are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment
under SFAS No. 133, we defer the effective portion of unrealized gains and losses associated with forward, swap and option contracts as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) until the underlying hedged transactions
are reported in earnings. We recognize the deferred portion as a component of cost of sales when the related inventory is sold or as foreign currency translation gain or loss for our hedges of intercompany loans when the payments are made. For those
derivative instruments that we consider economic hedges but do not designate for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133, we recognize gains and losses directly as a component of cost of sales or foreign currency translation loss,
depending on the nature of the underlying transaction.


Hedges of net investments in foreign operations

– We have numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries. The
net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We use foreign-currency-denominated debt to hedge our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. We designated our
euro denominated borrowings as a net investment hedge of a portion of our overall European operations. The gains and losses in our net investment in these designated European operations are economically offset by losses and gains in our euro
denominated borrowings. The change in the debt’s fair value is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses).

Guarantees:

We account for guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

, (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 requires us to disclose certain guarantees and to recognize a liability for the fair value of the
obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 13,

Commitments and Contingencies

for a further discussion of guarantees.

Income
Taxes:

We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. Prior to our spin-off from Altria, we were
included in Altria’s consolidated federal income tax return. We generally computed income taxes on a separate company basis; however, some of our foreign tax credits, capital losses and other credits could not be used on a separate company
basis. To the extent that Altria used our foreign tax credits and other tax benefits in its consolidated federal income tax return, we recognized the benefit in the calculation of our provision for income taxes. This benefit was approximately $270
million in 2007 (both through the date of our spin-off from Altria as well as post-spin carryback claims to pre-spin periods) and $195 million in 2006. We made payments to, or were reimbursed by, Altria for the tax effects resulting from being
included in Altria’s tax return. As of March 31, 2007, we are no longer a member of the Altria consolidated tax return group, and we now file our own federal consolidated income tax returns. Altria also previously carried our federal tax
contingencies on its balance sheet and reported them in its financial statements. As a result of the spin-off, Altria transferred our federal tax contingencies of $375 million to our balance sheet and related interest income of $77 million in 2007.
Additionally, during 2007, Altria paid us $305 million for the federal tax contingencies held by them, less the impact of federal reserves reversed due to the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48. This amount is reflected as a component of
other within the net cash provided by operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows.

In July 2006, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for the Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”). We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies
when tax benefits should be recorded in the financial statements and provides measurement criteria for valuing such benefits. In order for us to recognize benefits, our tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon audit. The amount
we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Before the implementation of FIN 48, we established additional provisions for certain positions that
were likely to be challenged even though we believe that those existing tax positions were fully supportable. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in an increase to shareholders’ equity as of January 1, 2007 of $213 million and
resulted from:

•

a $265 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, comprised of $247 million in tax and $18 million in interest;

•

a reduction in goodwill of $85 million; and

•

an increase to federal and state deferred tax assets of $33 million.

We recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not
that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Reclassification:

We reclassified dividends payable and income taxes in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007 from separate line items into other current liabilities to
conform with the current year’s presentation. We also reclassified income taxes and other working capital items in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 from separate line items into other
current assets and other current liabilities to conform with the current year’s presentation. In addition, we reclassified stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2007
and 2006 from other operating activities to a separate line item to conform with the current year’s presentation.


New Accounting Pronouncements:

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, (“SFAS No. 157”) as amended in February 2008 by FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS 157-2,

Effective Date
of FASB Statement No. 157

, (“FSP FAS 157-2”). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FSP FAS 157-2 defers the effective date of
SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those items recognized or disclosed at fair value on an annual or more frequently recurring basis, until January 1, 2009. As such, we partially adopted the provisions of SFAS
No. 157 effective January 1, 2008. The partial adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial statements. We expect to adopt the remaining provisions of SFAS No. 157 beginning in 2009. We expect this
adoption to impact the way in which we calculate fair value for our annual impairment review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, and when conditions exist that require us to calculate the fair value of long-lived assets; however, we
do not expect this adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business
Combinations

. The provisions, which change the way companies account for business combinations, are effective for Kraft as of January 1, 2009. This statement requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose all information needed by investors
to understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51

, the provisions of which
are effective for Kraft as of January 1, 2009. This statement requires an entity to classify noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries as a separate component of equity. Additionally, transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests
are required to be treated as equity transactions. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

The provisions are effective for Kraft as of January 1, 2009. This statement requires enhanced disclosures about
(i) how and why we use derivative instruments, (ii) how we account for derivative instruments and related hedged items under SFAS No. 133, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect our financial
results. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging
Issues Task Force (“EITF”) 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities

, (“FSP EITF 03-6-1”). The provisions are effective for Kraft as of January 1,
2009. FSP EITF 03-6-1 considers unvested share-based payment awards with the right to receive nonforfeitable dividends or their equivalents participating securities that should be included in the calculation of EPS under the two-class method. As
such, following the adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1, our restricted and deferred stock awards will be considered participating units in our calculation of EPS. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial
statements.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 132(R)-1,

Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

,
(“FSP FAS No. 132(R)-1”). The provisions are effective for Kraft as of January 1, 2009. FSP FAS No. 132(R)-1 provides guidance on an employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other
postretirement plan. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial statements.

Note 2.
Acquisitions and Divestitures:

LU Biscuit Acquisition:

On November 30, 2007, we acquired

LU

Biscuit for €5.1 billion (approximately $7.6 billion) in cash. The acquisition included 32 manufacturing facilities and approximately 14,000 employees. We acquired net assets
consisting primarily of goodwill of $4,052 million (which will not be deductible for statutory tax purposes), intangible assets of $3,546 million (substantially all of which are indefinite-lived), receivables of $757 million,
property, plant and equipment of $1,054 million and inventories of $204 million, and assumed liabilities of $1,063 million consisting primarily of accounts payable and accruals. These purchase price allocations were based upon appraisals that
were finalized in the third quarter of 2008. During the second quarter of 2008, we also repaid Groupe Danone S.A. for excess cash received upon the acquisition of

LU

Biscuit.

LU

Biscuit contributed net


revenues of $3.2 billion during 2008, and $2.8 billion on a proforma basis during 2007.

LU

Biscuit reported results from operations on a one month lag
in 2007; as such, there was no impact on our operating results. On a proforma basis,

LU

Biscuit’s net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007 would have been insignificant to Kraft.

United Biscuits Acquisition:

In September 2006, we acquired the
Spanish and Portuguese operations of United Biscuits (“UB”) for approximately $1.1 billion. The non-cash acquisition was financed by our assumption of $541 million of debt issued by the acquired business immediately prior to the
acquisition, as well as $530 million of value for the redemption of our outstanding investment in UB, primarily deep-discount securities. The redemption of our investment in UB resulted in a $251 million gain.

Post Cereals Split-off:

On August 4, 2008, we completed the
split-off of the

Post

cereals business into Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. (“Ralcorp”), after an exchange with our shareholders. The exchange is expected to be tax-free to participating shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

In this split-off transaction, approximately 46.1 million shares of Kraft Common Stock were tendered for $1,644 million. Our shareholders had the
option to exchange some or all of their shares of Kraft Common Stock and receive shares of common stock of Cable Holdco, Inc. (“Cable Holdco”). Cable Holdco was our wholly owned subsidiary that owned certain assets and liabilities of the

Post

cereals business. In exchange for the contribution of the

Post

cereals business, Cable Holdco issued approximately $665 million in debt securities, issued shares of its common stock and assumed a $300 million credit facility. Upon
closing, we used the cash equivalent net proceeds, approximately $960 million, to repay debt.

On June 25, 2008, Cable Holdco filed a registration
statement on Form S-1/S-4/A with the SEC that announced the start of the exchange offer. Approximately 30.5 million shares of Cable Holdco were offered in exchange for Kraft Common Stock at an exchange ratio of 0.6606. The exchange ratio was
calculated using the daily volume-weighted average prices of Kraft Common Stock and Ralcorp common stock on the NYSE on the last three trading days of the offer, which expired on August 4, 2008. The exchange offer was over-subscribed and as a
result, the number of shares of Kraft Common Stock accepted for exchange in the offer was prorated. Following the merger of Cable Holdco and a Ralcorp subsidiary, the Cable Holdco common stock was exchanged for shares of Ralcorp common stock on a
one-for-one basis.

The

Post

cereals business included such cereals as

Honey Bunches of Oats

,

Pebbles

,

Shredded Wheat

,

Selects

,

Grape-Nuts

and

Honeycomb

. Under Kraft, the brands in this transaction were distributed primarily in North America. In addition to the

Post

brands, the transaction included four manufacturing facilities, certain
manufacturing equipment and approximately 1,230 employees who joined Ralcorp as part of the transaction.

The results of the

Post

cereals business
were reflected as discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings and prior period results were restated in a consistent manner. Pursuant to the

Post

cereals business Transition Services Agreement, we agreed to provide
certain sales, co-manufacturing, distribution, information technology, and accounting and finance services to Ralcorp for up to 12 months, with Ralcorp’s option to extend it for an additional 6 months.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we increased our gain on discontinued operations by $77 million to correct for a deferred tax liability that should have been
written-off upon the split-off of the

Post

cereals business. As such, our gain from the split-off of the

Post

cereals business was $937 million.

Summary results of operations for the

Post

cereals business through August 4, 2008, were as follows:


The following assets of the

Post

cereals business were included in the

Post

split-off (in millions):

Other Divestitures:

In February 2009, we reached an agreement to divest a juice operation in Brazil. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and we expect it to close by mid-2009.

In 2008, we received $153 million in net proceeds, and recorded pre-tax losses of $92 million on divestitures, primarily related to a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation
and four operations in Spain. We recorded after-tax losses of $64 million on these divestitures.

Included in those divestitures were the following, which
were a condition of the EU Commission’s approval of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition:

•

We divested an operation in Spain. From this divestiture, we received $86 million in proceeds and recorded pre-tax losses of $74 million.

•

We divested a biscuit operation in Spain and a trademark in Hungary that we had previously acquired as part of the

LU

Biscuit acquisition. As such, the
impacts of these divestitures were reflected as adjustments to the purchase price allocations.

In 2007, we received $216 million in
proceeds and recorded pre-tax gains of $15 million on the divestitures of our hot cereal assets and trademarks, our sugar confectionery assets in Romania and related trademarks and our flavored water and juice brand assets and related
trademarks, including

Veryfine

and

Fruit2O

. We recorded an after-tax loss of $3 million on these divestitures to reflect the differing book and tax bases of our hot cereal assets and trademarks divestiture.

In 2006, we received $946 million in proceeds and recorded pre-tax gains of $117 million on the divestitures of our pet snacks brand and assets, rice brand and
assets, certain Canadian assets, our industrial coconut assets, a U.S. biscuit brand and a U.S. coffee plant. We recorded after-tax gains of $31 million on these divestitures, which reflects the tax expense of $57 million related to the differing
book and tax bases on our pet snacks brand and assets divestiture.

These gains and losses on divestitures do not reflect the related asset impairment
charges discussed in Note 6,

Asset Impairment

,

Exit and Implementation Costs

.

The aggregate operating results of the divestitures
discussed above, other than the divestiture of the

Post

cereals business, were not material to our financial statements in any of the periods presented. Refer to Note 17,

Segment Reporting

, for details of all (losses) / gains on
divestitures by segment.

Note 3. Inventories:

Inventories at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were:


We used the LIFO method to determine the cost of 35% of inventories at December 31, 2008 and 37% of inventories at
December 31, 2007.

Note 4. Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were:

Non-amortizable intangible assets consist substantially of brand names purchased through our acquisitions of
Nabisco Holdings Corp.,

LU

Biscuit and certain operations of UB (see Note 2,

Acquisitions and Divestitures

, for further details). Amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of trademark licenses, customer-related intangibles and
non-compete agreements.


The movements in goodwill and intangible assets were:

Significant changes to goodwill and intangible assets during 2008 were:

•

Acquisitions – We decreased goodwill by $1,187 million and increased intangible assets by $1,356 million primarily due to refinements of preliminary
allocations of purchase price for our acquisition of

LU

Biscuit. The allocations were based upon appraisals that were finalized in the third quarter of 2008.

•

Divestitures – We reduced goodwill by $1,234 million due to the split-off of our

Post

cereals business, and we reduced goodwill by $38 million and
intangible assets by $37 million due to the divestiture of an operation in Spain.

•

Asset impairments – We recorded asset impairment charges of $34 million to goodwill and $1 million to intangible assets in connection with the divestiture of a
Nordic and Baltic snacks operation. We also recorded asset impairment charges of $1 million to goodwill and $8 million to intangible assets in connection with the anticipated divestiture of a juice operation in Brazil. In addition, during the fourth
quarter of 2008, we completed our annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, and recorded a $44 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands, France and Puerto Rico.

•

Other – We reduced goodwill by $56 million primarily related to a reconciliation of our inventory of deferred tax items that also resulted in a write-down of
our net deferred tax liabilities.

Significant changes to goodwill and intangible assets during 2007 were:

•

Acquisitions – We increased goodwill by $5,239 million and intangible assets by $2,196 million related to preliminary allocations of purchase price for our
acquisition of

LU

Biscuit. The allocations were later finalized in 2008.

•

Divestitures – We reduced goodwill by $45 million and intangible assets by $134 million primarily due to the divestiture of our hot cereal assets and
trademarks.

•

Asset Impairments – We recorded an asset impairment charge of $70 million to intangible assets in conjunction with the divestiture of our flavored water and
juice brand assets and related trademarks.

•

Other – We reduced goodwill by $87 million primarily due to the adoption of FIN 48 (see Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

, for further
details), and reduced intangible assets by $17 million primarily due to the removal of a fully amortized intangible asset.

Amortization
expense for intangible assets was $23 million in 2008, $13 million in 2007 and $7 million in 2006. We currently estimate amortization expense for each of the next five years to be approximately $20 million or less.

Note 6. Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs:

Restructuring Program

In 2008, we completed our five-year restructuring program (the “Restructuring Program”). The objectives of
this program were to leverage our global scale, realign and lower our cost structure, and optimize capacity. As part of the Restructuring Program, we:

•

incurred $3.1 billion in pre-tax charges reflecting asset disposals, severance and implementation costs;

•

announced the closure of 36 facilities and announced the elimination of approximately 19,000 positions; and

•

will use cash to pay for $2.0 billion of the $3.1 billion in charges.


We incurred charges under the Restructuring Program of $989 million in 2008, $459 million in 2007 and
$673 million in 2006. Since the inception of the Restructuring Program, we have paid cash for $1.5 billion of the $3.1 billion in charges. At December 31, 2008, we had $489 million accrued in Restructuring Program costs.

In 2008, we implemented a new operating structure built on three core elements: business units; shared services that leverage the scale of our global portfolio; and a
streamlined corporate staff. Within the new structure, business units now have full P&L accountability and are staffed accordingly. This also ensures that we are putting our resources closer to where we make decisions that affect our consumers
and customers. Our corporate and shared service functions continue to streamline their organizations and focus on core activities that can more efficiently support the goals of the business units. The intent is to simplify, streamline and increase
accountability, with the ultimate goal of generating reliable growth for Kraft. In total, we will eliminate approximately 1,500 positions as we streamline our headquarter functions.

We are also in the process of reorganizing our European operations to function on a pan-European centralized category management and value chain model. After the reorganization is complete, the European Principal
Company (“EPC”) will manage the European categories centrally and make decisions for all aspects of the value chain, except for sales and distribution. The European subsidiaries will execute sales and distribution locally, and the local
production companies will act as toll manufacturers on behalf of the EPC. The EPC legal entity has been incorporated as Kraft Foods Europe GmbH in Zurich, Switzerland. As part of the reorganization, we incurred $16 million of restructuring costs,
$39 million of implementation costs and $11 million of non-recurring costs during 2008; $21 million of restructuring costs, $24 million of implementation costs and $10 million of non-recurring costs during 2007; and $7 million of restructuring
costs during 2006. Restructuring and implementation costs are included in the total Restructuring Program charges. Other costs relating to our Kraft Europe Reorganization are recorded as marketing, administration and research costs. Management
believes the disclosure of implementation and other non-recurring charges provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our Kraft Europe Reorganization.

During the second quarter of 2006, we entered into a seven-year, $1.7 billion agreement to receive information technology services from Electronic Data Systems
(“EDS”). On June 1, 2006, we began using EDS’s data centers, and EDS started providing us with web hosting, telecommunications and IT workplace services. In 2008, we incurred restructuring costs of $2 million and
implementation costs of $14 million related to the EDS transition. In 2007, we reversed $6 million in restructuring costs because our severance costs were lower than originally anticipated, and we incurred implementation costs of $47 million.
In 2006, we incurred restructuring costs of $51 million and implementation costs of $56 million. These amounts are included in the total Restructuring Program charges.

Restructuring Costs:

Under the Restructuring Program, we recorded asset impairment and exit costs of $884 million
during 2008, $332 million during 2007 and $578 million during 2006. We will pay cash for $659 million of the charges that we incurred during 2008. As part of the program, we announced the closure of six plants during 2008.

Restructuring liability activity for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was:


Severance charges include the cost of benefits received by terminated employees. As of December 31, 2008, we had
eliminated approximately 15,200 positions, and we had announced our intent to eliminate an additional 3,800 positions. Severance charges against assets primarily relate to incremental pension costs, which reduce prepaid pension assets. Asset
impairment write-downs were caused by plant closings and related activity. Cash received on asset write-downs reflects the net cash proceeds from the sales of assets previously written-down under the Restructuring Program. We incurred other costs
related primarily to the renegotiation of supplier contract costs, workforce reductions associated with facility closings and the termination of leasing agreements.

Implementation Costs:

Implementation costs are directly attributable to exit costs; however, they do not qualify for
treatment under SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

. These costs primarily include the discontinuance of certain product lines, incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities, the EDS
transition and the reorganization of our European operations discussed above. Management believes the disclosure of implementation charges provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our Restructuring
Program. Substantially all implementation costs incurred in 2008 will require cash payments.

Implementation costs associated with the Restructuring
Program were:

Asset Impairment Charges

During our 2008 review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $44 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands, France and Puerto Rico. In addition, in
December 2008, we reached a preliminary agreement to divest a juice operation in Brazil and reached an agreement to sell a cheese plant in Australia. In anticipation of divesting the juice operation in Brazil, we recorded an asset impairment
charge of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The charge primarily included the write-off of associated intangible assets of $8 million and property, plant and equipment of $4 million. In anticipation of selling the cheese plant in Australia,
we recorded an asset impairment charge of $28 million to property, plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of 2008. Additionally, in 2008, we divested a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and incurred an asset impairment charge of $55 million in
connection with the divestiture. This charge primarily included the write-off of associated goodwill of $34 million and property, plant and equipment of $16 million. We recorded the aggregate asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit
costs.

In 2007, we divested our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks. In recognition of the divestiture, we recorded a $120
million asset impairment charge for these assets. The charge primarily included the write-off of associated intangible assets of $70 million and property, plant and equipment of $47 million and was recorded within asset impairment and exit costs.

During our 2006 annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $24 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets
in Egypt and our hot cereal intangible assets in the U.S. Additionally, during 2006, we re-evaluated the business model for our

Tassimo

hot beverage system, the revenues of which lagged our projections. This evaluation resulted in a
$245 million asset impairment charge related to lower utilization of existing manufacturing capacity. We also incurred an asset impairment charge of $86 million during 2006 in recognition of our pet snacks brand and assets divestiture. The
charge primarily included the write-off of a portion of the associated goodwill of $25 million and intangible assets of $55 million. In addition, in January 2007, we announced the divestiture of our hot cereal assets and trademarks. We recorded
an asset impairment charge of $69 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 in connection with the anticipated divestiture. The charge primarily included the write-off of a portion of the associated goodwill of $15 million and intangible assets of $52
million. The transaction closed in 2007 and no further impairment charges were incurred for this divestiture. We recorded the aggregate asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs.


Total – Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs

We included the asset impairment, exit and implementation costs discussed above, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 in segment operating income as
follows:


The fair values of our short-term borrowings at December 31, 2008 and 2007, based upon current market
interest rates, approximate the amounts disclosed above.

Borrowing Arrangements:

We maintain a revolving credit facility that we have historically used for general corporate purposes and to support our commercial paper issuances. The $4.5 billion, multi-year revolving credit facility expires
in April 2010. No amounts have been drawn on this facility. In October 2008, one of the syndicate banks under our credit facility, Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc., filed for bankruptcy protection. Lehman’s commitment under our credit
facility is approximately $136 million. We do not expect to replace them, and our capacity under our credit facility will accordingly be reduced to approximately $4.4 billion.

We must maintain a net worth of at least $20.0 billion under the terms of our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2008, our net worth was $22.2 billion. We expect to continue to meet this covenant.
The revolving credit facility has no other financial covenants, credit rating triggers or provisions that could require us to post collateral as security.

In addition to the above, some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet short-term working capital needs. Collectively, these credit lines amounted to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2008.
Borrowings on these lines amounted to $291 million at December 31, 2008 and $250 million at December 31, 2007.

At December 31, 2007,
we had borrowed €3.8 billion (approximately $5.5 billion) under the 364-day bridge facility agreement we used to acquire

LU

Biscuit (“

LU

Biscuit Bridge Facility”). Under the terms of the credit agreement, we were
required to repay borrowings with the net cash proceeds from debt offerings having a maturity of greater than one year. As such, we repaid the €3.8 billion (approximately $5.9 billion at the time of repayments) with proceeds from our
March 20, 2008 and May 22, 2008 debt issuances discussed below. Upon repayment, this facility was terminated.


Long-Term Debt:

On
December 19, 2008, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds ($498 million) for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. The general terms of the $500 million notes
are: $500 million total principal notes due February 19, 2014 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 6.750%. Interest is payable semiannually, and began on February 19, 2009.

On May 22, 2008, we issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds ($1,967 million) for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under our

LU

Biscuit
Bridge Facility and other short-term borrowings. The general terms of the $2.0 billion notes are:

•

$1,250 million total principal notes due August 23, 2018 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 6.125%. Interest is payable semiannually beginning
February 23, 2009.

•

$750 million total principal notes due January 26, 2039 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 6.875%. Interest is payable semiannually, and began on
January 26, 2009.

On March 20, 2008, we issued €2.85 billion (approximately $4.5 billion) of senior unsecured notes and
used the net proceeds (approximately $4,470 million) to repay a portion of our

LU

Biscuit Bridge Facility. The general terms of the €2.85 billion notes are:

•

€2.0 billion (approximately $3.2 billion) total principal notes due March 20, 2012 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 5.750%. Interest is payable

On December 12, 2007, we issued $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes and used the net
proceeds ($2,966 million) for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper and a portion of our

LU

Biscuit Bridge Facility. The general terms of the $3.0 billion notes are:

December 31, 2008 was 2.735%. Interest on the floating rate notes is payable quarterly, and began on November 13, 2007.

The
notes from all issuances discussed above include covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt secured by liens above a certain threshold. We are also required to offer to purchase these notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, if we experience both of the following:

(i)

a “change of control” triggering event, and

(ii)

a downgrade of these notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch, Inc. within
a specified period.

We expect to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants.


At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our long-term debt consisted of (interest rates were as of December 31, 2008):


Note 8. Capital Stock:

Our articles of incorporation authorize 3.0 billion shares of Class A common stock, 2.0 billion shares of Class B common stock and 500 million shares of preferred stock. Shares of Class A
common stock issued, repurchased and outstanding were:

In March 2007, we repurchased 1.4 million additional shares of our Common Stock from Altria at a cost of
$46.5 million. We paid $32.085 per share, which was the average of the high and the low price of Kraft Common Stock as reported on the NYSE on March 1, 2007. This repurchase was in accordance with our Altria spin-off agreement.


Note 9. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses:

The components of accumulated other comprehensive losses were:

Note 10. Stock Plans:

Beginning in 2008, we changed our annual and long-term incentive compensation programs to further align them with shareholder returns. Under the annual incentive program, we now grant equity in the form of both
restricted or deferred stock and stock options. The restricted or deferred stock will continue to vest 100% after three years, and the stock options will vest one-third each year beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Additionally, we
changed our long-term incentive plan from a cash-based program to a share-based program. These shares vest based on varying performance, market and service conditions.

Under the Kraft 2005 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”), we may grant to eligible employees awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted and deferred stock
units, and other awards based on our Common Stock, as well as performance-based annual and long-term incentive awards. We are authorized to issue a maximum of 150 million shares of our Common Stock under the 2005 Plan, of which no more than
45 million shares may be awarded as


restricted or deferred stock. In addition, under the Kraft 2006 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “2006 Directors Plan”), we
may grant up to 500,000 shares of Common Stock to members of the Board of Directors who are not our full-time employees. At December 31, 2008, there were 95,075,163 shares available to be granted under the 2005 Plan and 412,996 shares available
to be granted under the 2006 Directors Plan. Restricted or deferred shares available for grant under the 2005 Plan at December 31, 2008, were 27,229,592.

All stock awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. We have no specific policy to repurchase Common Stock to mitigate the dilutive impact of options; however, we have historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on
cash availability, market trends and other factors, to satisfy stock option exercise activity.

On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123
(Revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

, (“SFAS No. 123(R)”) under the modified prospective method. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) had an insignificant impact on earnings in 2006. The gross cumulative effect was recorded in
marketing, administration and research costs.

Stock Option Plan:

Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the grant date, generally become exercisable one-third each year beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date
and have a maximum term of ten years. Prior to 2008, we had not granted stock options through a broad-based program since 2002.

We account for our
employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a modified Black-Scholes methodology to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. The fair value of the stock options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over
the vesting period. We recorded compensation expense related to stock options of $18 million in 2008. The deferred tax benefit recorded related to this compensation expense was $6 million in 2008. The unamortized compensation expense related to our
stock options was $40 million at December 31, 2008 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions were as follows:

In February 2008, as part of our annual incentive program, we granted 13.5 million stock options to eligible
U.S. and non-U.S. employees at an exercise price of $29.49. We also granted 0.1 million off-cycle stock options during 2008 at an exercise price of $30.78.

On May 3, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a stock option grant to our CEO to recognize her election as our Chairman. She received 300,000 stock options under the 2005 Plan, which vest under varying market and service conditions
and expire ten years after the grant date. The grant had an insignificant impact on earnings in 2007.


Prior to our IPO, certain Kraft employees participated in Altria’s stock compensation plans. After the IPO, Altria
did not issue stock awards to our employees, other than reloads of previously issued options and stock awards issued as a result of our spin-off from Altria. No reloads were issued during 2008 and 2007. Compensation expense for Altria stock option
awards for reloads totaled $3 million in 2006, and the related tax benefit totaled $1 million. The fair value of the awards was determined using a modified Black-Scholes methodology using the following weighted-average assumptions for Altria common
stock.

In January 2008, we granted 1.4 million shares of stock in connection with our long-term incentive plan, and
the market value per share was $32.26 on the date of grant. In February 2008, as part of our annual incentive program, we issued 3.4 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees, and the market value
per restricted or deferred share was $29.49 on the date of grant. We also issued 0.2 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2008, and the weighted-average market value per restricted or deferred share was $30.38 on the
date of grant.

In January 2007, we issued 5.2 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees as part of our
annual incentive program. The market value per restricted or deferred share was $34.655 on the date of grant. Additionally, we issued 1.0 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2007. The weighted-average market value
per restricted or deferred share was $34.085 on the date of grant. The total number of restricted and deferred shares issued in 2007 was 9.2 million, including those issued as a result of our spin-off from Altria (discussed below).


The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted and deferred stock granted was $151 million, or $30.38 per
restricted or deferred share, in 2008, $310 million, or $33.63 per restricted or deferred share, in 2007 and $200 million, or $29.16 per restricted or deferred share, in 2006. The vesting date fair value of restricted and deferred stock was
$196 million in 2008, $153 million in 2007, and $123 million in 2006.

Bifurcation of Stock Awards Upon Spin-Off from Altria:

Upon our spin-off, Altria stock awards were modified through the issuance of Kraft stock awards, and accordingly, the Altria stock awards were split into two instruments.
Holders of Altria stock options received: 1) a new Kraft option to acquire shares of Kraft Common Stock; and 2) an adjusted Altria stock option for the same number of shares of Altria common stock previously held, but with a proportionally reduced
exercise price. For each employee stock option outstanding, the aggregate intrinsic value immediately after our spin-off from Altria was not greater than the aggregate intrinsic value immediately prior to it. Holders of Altria restricted stock or
stock rights awarded before January 31, 2007 retained their existing awards and received restricted stock or stock rights in Kraft Common Stock. Recipients of Altria restricted stock or stock rights awarded on or after January 31, 2007 did
not receive Kraft restricted stock or stock rights because Altria had announced the spin-off at that time. We reimbursed Altria $179 million for net settlement of the employee stock awards. We determined the fair value of the stock options using the
Black-Scholes option valuation model, and adjusted the fair value of the restricted stock and stock rights by the value of projected forfeitures.

Based
upon the number of Altria stock awards outstanding upon our spin-off, we granted stock options for 24.2 million shares of Kraft Common Stock at a weighted-average price of $15.75. The options expire between 2007 and 2012. In addition, we issued
3.0 million shares of restricted stock and stock rights. The market value per restricted share or right was $31.66 on the date of grant. Restrictions on the majority of these restricted stock and stock rights lapse in the first quarter of
either 2008 or 2009.

Note 11. Benefit Plans:

Pension Plans

Obligations and Funded Status:

The projected benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of our pension plans at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were:


The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to the measurement date, was $5,464 million at
December 31, 2008 and $5,349 million at December 31, 2007 for the U.S. pension plans. The accumulated benefit obligation for the non-U.S. pension plans was $3,024 million at December 31, 2008 and $3,979 million at
December 31, 2007.

The combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans resulted in a net pension liability of $2,340 million at December 31, 2008
and a net prepaid pension asset of $820 million at December 31, 2007. We recognized these amounts in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2008 and 2007 as follows:


Retired employees elected lump-sum payments, resulting in settlement losses for the U.S. plans of $55 million in 2008,
$47 million in 2007 and $49 million in 2006. Additionally, as previously discussed in Note 6,

Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs,

we announced several workforce reduction initiatives as part of the Restructuring
Program. Employees left Kraft under these initiatives, resulting in settlement losses for the U.S. plans of $19 million in 2008, $21 million in 2007 and $17 million in 2006. Non-U.S. plant closures and early retirement benefits resulted in
curtailment and settlement losses of $16 million in 2008, $4 million in 2007 and $13 million in 2006. These costs are included in other expense above.

For the U.S. plans, we determine the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost using a calculated market return value that recognizes the cost over a four year period. For our non-U.S. plans, we utilize a similar
approach with varying cost recognition periods for some plans, and with others, we determine the expected return on plan assets based on asset fair values as of the measurement date.

For the combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, we expect to amortize from accumulated other comprehensive losses into net periodic pension cost during 2009:

•

an estimated $180 million of net loss from experience differences; and

•

an estimated $11 million of prior service cost.

We
used the following weighted-average assumptions to determine our net pension cost for the years ended December 31:

Our investment strategy is based on our expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over
the long term. Accordingly, the composition of our U.S. plan assets is broadly characterized as a 70% / 30% allocation between equity and debt securities. The strategy uses indexed U.S. equity securities, actively managed international equity
securities and actively managed investment grade debt securities (which constitute 80% or more of debt securities) with lesser allocations to high yield and international debt securities.

For the plans outside the U.S., the investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset / liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. These
specific circumstances result in a level of equity exposure that is typically less than the U.S. plans. In aggregate, the asset allocation targets of our non-U.S. plans are broadly characterized as a mix of 50% equity securities, 40% debt securities
and 10% real estate / other.

We attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes as we make
contributions and monthly benefit payments. We intend to rebalance our plan portfolios by mid-2009 by making contributions and monthly benefit payments.


We make contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, primarily, to the extent that they are tax deductible and
do not generate an excise tax liability. Based on current tax law, we plan to make contributions of approximately $220 million to our U.S. plans and approximately $170 million to our non-U.S. plans in 2009. However, our actual
contributions may be different due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, pension asset performance that differs significantly from the expected performance, or significant changes in interest rates.

Future Benefit Payments:

The estimated future benefit payments from
our pension plans at December 31, 2008 were:

The current portion of our accrued postretirement health care costs of $221 million at December 31, 2008 and
$217 million at December 31, 2007 is included in other accrued liabilities.


We used the following weighted-average assumptions to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at
December 31:


Future Benefit Payments:

Our estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans at December 31, 2008 were:

The postemployment benefit plan cost of workforce reduction initiatives announced under the Restructuring Program
was $560 million in 2008, $132 million in 2007 and $247 million in 2006. These costs are included in other expense above.

The estimated net gain
for the postemployment benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive losses into net postemployment costs during 2009 is insignificant.


Note 12. Financial Instruments:

Commodity Cash Flow Hedges:

For derivative instruments that are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting
under SFAS No. 133, we expect to transfer unrealized losses of $108 million (net of taxes) to earnings during the next 12 months, and recognized an insignificant amount during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. We recorded
an insignificant amount of ineffectiveness in earnings during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

For the derivative instruments that
we considered economic hedges but did not designate for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133, we recognized net gains of $56 million in 2007. The impact to earnings was insignificant in 2008 and 2006.

As of December 31, 2008, we had hedged forecasted commodity transactions for periods not exceeding the next 15 months.

Foreign Currency Cash Flow Hedges:

For derivative instruments that
are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133, we expect to transfer unrealized gains of $77 million (net of taxes) to earnings during the next 12 months, and recognized an insignificant amount during the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. We recorded no ineffectiveness in our foreign currency cash flow hedges in earnings during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. In October 2008, one of our counterparties, Lehman
Brothers Commercial Corporation, filed for bankruptcy. Consequently, we wrote off an insignificant asset related to derivatives held with them. This did not have a significant impact on our foreign currency risk management program.

For the derivative instruments that we consider economic hedges but did not designate for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133, we recognized net losses in
earnings of $50 million in 2008, $231 million in 2007 and $124 million in 2006. The majority of these losses were attributable to hedges of intercompany loans and were economically offset with foreign currency gains from the intercompany receivable.

As of December 31, 2008, we had hedged forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods not exceeding the next 36 months. Excluding intercompany
loans, we had hedged forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods not exceeding the next 12 months.

Impact on Other Comprehensive Losses:

Derivatives accounted for as hedges affected accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of taxes, during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, as follows:


Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations:

We designated the euro denominated borrowings used to finance the

LU

Biscuit acquisition as a net investment hedge of a portion of our overall European operations. Our cumulative translation adjustment, which
is net of taxes, included gains of $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to the euro denominated borrowings.

Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies:

Legal
Proceedings:

We are defendants in a variety of legal proceedings. Plaintiffs in a few of those cases seek substantial damages. We cannot predict with
certainty the results of these proceedings. However, we believe that the final outcome of these proceedings will not materially affect our financial results.

In 2008, we recorded charges of $72 million for legal matters related to certain of our U.S. and European operations, including U.S. coffee operations.

Third-Party Guarantees:

We have third-party guarantees because of our acquisition, divestiture and construction activities. As part of
those transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2008, the maximum potential payments under our third-party guarantees were $43 million, of which approximately
$8 million have no specified expiration dates. Substantially all of the remainder expire at various times through 2018. The carrying amounts of these guarantees were $38 million on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008.

Leases:

Rental expenses were $505 million in 2008,
$433 million in 2007 and $416 million in 2006. Minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases in effect at December 31, 2008 were (in millions):


Note 14. Income Taxes:

Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006:

Additionally, the 2008 earnings and gain from discontinued operations from the split-off of the

Post

cereals business included a net tax benefit of $104 million.

As of January 1, 2008, our unrecognized tax benefits were $850 million. If we had
recognized all of these benefits, the net impact on our income tax provision would have been $666 million. Our unrecognized tax benefits were $807 million at December 31, 2008, and if we had recognized all of these benefits, the net impact on
our income tax provision would have been $612 million. We expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease approximately $70 million to $75 million during the next 12 months due to various audit resolutions and the expirations of statutes of
limitations. We include accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. We had accrued interest and penalties of $232 million as of January 1, 2008 and $239 million as of December 31, 2008. Our 2008
provision for income taxes included $17 million for interest and penalties, and we paid $6 million during 2008. Furthermore, in 2008, we decreased our interest and penalties accrual by $4 million due to refinements of preliminary allocations of
purchase price for our acquisition of

LU

Biscuit.


The changes in our unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were (in millions):

Our 2008 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $242 million from discrete tax events. Of the total
net tax benefits, $29 million related to a reconciliation of our inventory of deferred tax items that resulted in a write-down of our net deferred tax liabilities in the third quarter, and $42 million related to fourth quarter corrections of state,
federal and foreign tax liabilities. The remaining net tax benefits primarily related to the resolution of various tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. Other discrete tax benefits included the
impact from divestitures of a Nordic and Baltic


snacks operation and several operations in Spain and the tax benefit from impairment charges taken in 2008. In addition, the 2008 tax rate benefited
from foreign earnings taxed below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and from the expected tax benefit on 2008 restructuring expenses. These benefits were only partially offset by state tax expense and certain foreign costs.

Our 2007 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $184 million, primarily including the effects of dividend repatriation benefits, foreign joint venture earnings,
and the effect on foreign deferred taxes from lower foreign tax rates enacted in 2007. The 2007 tax rate also benefited from foreign earnings taxed below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, an increased domestic manufacturing deduction and the
divestiture of our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks. These benefits were partially offset by state tax expense, tax costs associated with the divestiture of our hot cereal assets and trademarks and interest income from
Altria related to the transfer of our federal tax contingencies discussed in Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

.

During 2006, the
IRS concluded its examination of Altria’s consolidated tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999. The IRS issued a final Revenue Agents Report on March 15, 2006. Consequently, Altria reimbursed us $337 million for federal tax reserves
that were no longer necessary and $46 million for interest ($29 million net of tax). We also recognized net state tax reversals of $39 million, for a total tax provision benefit of $376 million ($337 million federal plus $39 million state). The
total benefit to net earnings that we recognized in the first quarter of 2006 due to the IRS settlement was $405 million. The 2006 tax rate also benefited from the resolution of various tax items in our foreign operations, dividend repatriation
benefits, joint venture earnings, and lower foreign tax rates enacted in 2006 (primarily Canada). These benefits were partially offset by state tax expense and by the tax costs associated with our 2006 divestitures.

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following at December 31, 2008 and 2007:


Note 15. Earnings Per Share:

Basic and diluted EPS from continuing and discontinued operations were calculated using the following:

For the year ended December 31, 2008, we excluded 11.3 million Kraft stock options from the calculation
of weighted-average shares for diluted EPS because they were antidilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we excluded an insignificant number of Kraft stock options from the calculation of weighted-average shares for diluted
EPS because they were antidilutive.

Note 16. Transactions with Altria Group, Inc.:

On March 30, 2007, we entered into a post-spin Transition Services Agreement with Altria’s subsidiary, Altria Corporate Services, Inc. (“ALCS”).
Under the agreement, ALCS provided information technology services to Kraft during the EDS transition. Before our spin-off from Altria, ALCS provided pre-spin administrative services to us under a separate Corporate Services agreement that expired
on March 30, 2007. These services included planning, legal, treasury, auditing, insurance, human resources, office of the secretary, corporate affairs, information technology, aviation and tax services. Billings for these services were $29
million in 2007 and $178 million in 2006. As of January 1, 2008, ALCS no longer provided services to Kraft.

On March 30, 2007, we also
entered into Employee Matters and Tax Sharing Agreements with Altria. The Employee Matters Agreement set out each company’s obligations for employee transfers, equity compensation and other employee benefits matters for individuals moving,
or who previously moved between companies. The Tax Sharing Agreement identified Altria’s and Kraft’s rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to our income taxes following our spin-off from Altria. It also placed certain
restrictions on us, including a 2-year limit on share repurchases of no more than 20% of our Common Stock outstanding at the time of our spin-off from Altria.

Also, see Note 14,

Income Taxes

, for information on how the closure of an IRS review of Altria’s consolidated federal income tax return in 2006 impacted us.


Note 17. Segment Reporting:

Kraft manufactures and markets packaged food products, including snacks, beverages, cheese, convenient meals and various packaged grocery products. We manage and report operating results through two commercial units,
Kraft North America and Kraft International. We manage Kraft North America’s operations by product category, and its reportable segments are U.S. Beverages, U.S. Cheese, U.S. Convenient Meals, U.S. Grocery, U.S. Snacks (formerly known as
U.S. Snacks & Cereals) and Canada & North America Foodservice. We manage Kraft International’s operations by geographic location, and its reportable segments are European Union and Developing Markets.

Effective August 4, 2008, we completed the split-off of the

Post

cereals business. The results of the

Post

cereals business were reflected as
discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings and prior period results were restated in a consistent manner.

In 2008, we implemented a
new operating structure. As a result, we began reporting the results of operations under this new structure in the first quarter of 2008 and restated results from prior periods in a consistent manner. The changes were:

•

U.S. Cheese was organized as a standalone operating segment in order to create a more self-contained and integrated business unit in support of faster growth.

•

Our macaroni and cheese category, as well as other dinner products, were moved from our U.S. Convenient Meals segment to our U.S. Grocery segment to take
advantage of operating synergies.

•

Canada and North America Foodservice were structured as a standalone reportable segment. This change allows us to deliver on the unique requirements of the Canadian
consumer and customer while maintaining strong North American linkages to innovation, new product development and new capabilities to drive our business. Furthermore, it allows us to manage strategic customer decisions and continue to capture
cross-border sales and marketing synergies within our Foodservice operations.

Management uses segment operating income to evaluate
segment performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities
(which is a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles for all periods presented. In the second quarter of 2008, we began excluding unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities from segment operating
income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Once realized, the gains and losses on hedging activities are recorded within segment operating results. We centrally manage interest and other expense and the
provision for income taxes. Accordingly, we do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews. We use the same accounting policies for the segments as those described in
Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.


Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2008. In
2008, we began implementing “Catalyst,” a business initiative to simplify and harmonize our systems processes. This multi-year program includes the delivery of SAP enterprise software applications and business solution. During the quarter
ended December 31, 2008, we transitioned some of our processes and procedures into the SAP control environment. As we migrate to the SAP environment, our management ensures that our key controls are mapped to applicable SAP controls, tests
transition controls prior to the migration date of those controls, and as appropriate, maintains and evaluates controls over the flow of information to and from SAP. We expect the transition period to be completed in 2011. We determined that there
were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2008, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America;

•

provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on
the consolidated financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and
internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

Management reviewed the results of our assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on this assessment, management determined
that, as of December 31, 2008, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered
public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements included in this report, has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Kraft Foods Inc.:

In our
opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of shareholders’ equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kraft Foods Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control
– Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in 2006 and 2008 and the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions and the timing of its annual goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests in 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
