PART I

Item 1.  Business.

General

Kraft Foods is the world’s second largest food company, with revenues of $40.4 billion and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of $4.3
billion in 2009. Kraft Foods was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. We have approximately 97,000 employees worldwide, and we manufacture and market packaged food products, including snacks, beverages, cheese, convenient meals and
various packaged grocery products. We sell our products to consumers in approximately 160 countries. At December 31, 2009, we had operations in more than 70 countries and made our products at 159 manufacturing and processing facilities
worldwide. At December 31, 2009, we had net assets of $25.9 billion and gross assets of $66.7 billion. We are a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Standard & Poor’s 500, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the Ethibel
Sustainability Index.

At December 31, 2009, our portfolio included nine brands with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion each:

Kraft

cheeses, dinners and dressings;

Oscar Mayer

meats;

Philadelphia

cream cheese;

Maxwell House

and

Jacobs

coffee;

Nabisco

cookies and crackers and its

Oreo

cookie brand;

Milka

chocolates; and

LU

biscuits. Our portfolio included approximately 50 brands which each generate annual revenues of more than $100 million.

Prior to June 13, 2001,
Kraft Foods was a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”). On June 13, 2001, we completed an initial public offering of 280,000,000 shares of our Common Stock. In the first quarter of 2007, Altria spun off its
remaining interest (89.0%) in Kraft Foods on a pro rata basis to Altria stockholders in a tax-free transaction. Effective as of the close of business on March 30, 2007, all Kraft Foods shares owned by Altria were distributed to
Altria’s stockholders, and our separation from Altria was completed.

Because Kraft Foods Inc. is a holding company, our principal source of funds
is from our subsidiaries. Our wholly owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock.

Reportable Segments

We manage and report operating results
through three geographic units: Kraft Foods North America, Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets. We manage the operations of Kraft Foods North America and Kraft Foods Europe by product category, and we manage the operations of Kraft
Foods Developing Markets by location. Our reportable segments are U.S. Beverages, U.S. Cheese, U.S. Convenient Meals, U.S. Grocery, U.S. Snacks, Canada & North America Foodservice, Kraft Foods Europe (formerly known as European Union)
and Kraft Foods Developing Markets.

In January 2009, we began implementing changes to our operating structure based on our

Organizing For Growth

initiative and the Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization. In line with our strategies, we are reorganizing our European operations to function on a pan-European centralized category management and value chain model, and we changed how we work in Europe
in two key ways:

•

We transitioned our European Biscuit, Chocolate, Coffee and Cheese categories to fully integrated business units, further strengthening our focus on these core
categories. To ensure decisions are made faster and closer to our customers and consumers, each category is fully accountable for its financial results, including marketing, manufacturing and R&D. Category leadership, based in Zurich,
Switzerland, reports to the Kraft Foods Europe President. These business units now comprise the Kraft Foods Europe segment.

•

We aligned the reporting of our Central Europe operations into our Kraft Foods Developing Markets segment to help build critical scale in these countries. We
operate a country-led model in these markets.

Note 16,

Segment Reporting

, to our consolidated financial statements includes a
breakout of net revenues, segment operating income, total assets, depreciation expense and capital expenditures by reportable segment, as well as a breakout of net revenues, long-lived assets and total assets by geographic region. Management uses
segment


operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment
operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), certain components of our U.S. pension plan cost (which is a component of cost of sales and marketing, administration and research
costs), general corporate expenses (which are a component of marketing, administration and research costs) and amortization of intangibles.

The
relative percentages of total segment operating income attributable to each reportable segment were:

Our U.S. subsidiaries export
coffee products, refreshment beverage products, grocery products, cheese, biscuits and processed meats. In 2009, these U.S. exports amounted to $522 million.


Products or similar products contributing 10% or more to Kraft Foods’ consolidated net revenues for the years
ended December 31, were:

Our major brands within each reportable segment and consumer sector at December 31, 2009 were:


Significant Acquisitions and
Divestitures

Cadbury Acquisition:

On
January 19, 2010, we announced the terms of our final offer for each outstanding ordinary share of Cadbury plc (“Cadbury”), including each ordinary share represented by an American Depositary Share (“Cadbury ADS”), and the
Cadbury board of directors recommended that Cadbury shareholders accept the terms of the final offer. Under the terms of the offer, we agreed to pay Cadbury shareholders 500 pence in cash and 0.1874 shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock per Cadbury
ordinary share validly tendered and 2,000 pence in cash and 0.7496 shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock per Cadbury ADS validly tendered. This valued each Cadbury ordinary share at 840 pence and each Cadbury ADS at £33.60 (based on the closing
price of $29.58 for a share of Kraft Foods Common Stock on January 15, 2010 and an exchange rate of $1.63 per £1.00) and valued the entire issued share capital of Cadbury at £11.9 billion (approximately $19.4 billion) on
January 15, 2010, the last trading day before the publication of our final offer. The combination of Kraft Foods and Cadbury will create a global powerhouse in snacks, confectionery and quick meals with a rich portfolio of iconic brands.

On February 2, 2010, all of the conditions to the offer were satisfied or validly waived, the initial offer period expired and a subsequent offer
period immediately began. At that point, we had received acceptances of 71.73% of the outstanding Cadbury ordinary shares, including those represented by Cadbury ADSs. The subsequent offer period remains open until further notice and at
least 14 days of notice will be given if Kraft Foods decides to close the offer. As of February 15, 2010, we had received acceptances of 1,262,356,520 shares representing 91.02% of the outstanding Cadbury ordinary shares, including those
represented by Cadbury ADSs. As we have received


acceptances of over 90% of Cadbury shares, we are in the process of acquiring the remaining Cadbury ordinary shares that are not tendered in the offer, including those represented by Cadbury
ADSs, through a compulsory acquisition procedure under the United Kingdom Companies Act of 2006, as amended. Additionally, as a condition of the EU Commission’s approval of the Cadbury acquisition, we are required to divest confectionary
operations in Poland and Romania. As part of our acquisition of Cadbury, we expensed approximately $40 million in transaction related fees in 2009 as we incurred them, and we also incurred $40 million in financing fees in 2009 related to the
acquisition.

Pizza Divestiture

:

On
January 4, 2010, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets of our North American frozen pizza business (“Frozen Pizza”) to Nestlé USA, Inc. (“Nestlé”) for total consideration of $3.7 billion. Our Frozen
Pizza business is a component of our U.S. Convenient Meals and Canada & N.A. Foodservice segments. The sale, which is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory clearances, includes the

DiGiorno

,

Tombstone

and

Jack’s

brands in the U.S., the

Delissio

brand in Canada and the

California Pizza Kitchen

trademark license. It also includes two Wisconsin manufacturing facilities (Medford and Little Chute) and the leases for the pizza
depots and delivery trucks. It is estimated that approximately 3,400 of our employees will transfer with the business to Nestlé. We anticipate that the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2010.

Post Cereals Split-off:

On August 4, 2008, we completed
the split-off of the

Post

cereals business into Ralcorp Holdings, Inc., after an exchange with our shareholders. Accordingly, the

Post

cereals business prior period results were reflected as discontinued operations on the consolidated
statement of earnings. The exchange was expected to be tax-free to participating shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

In this split-off
transaction, approximately 46.1 million shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock were tendered for $1,644 million. Our shareholders had the option to exchange some or all of their shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock and receive shares of common stock
of Cable Holdco, Inc. (“Cable Holdco”). Cable Holdco was our wholly owned subsidiary that owned certain assets and liabilities of the

Post

cereals business. In exchange for the contribution of the

Post

cereals business, Cable
Holdco issued approximately $665 million in debt securities, issued shares of its common stock and assumed a $300 million credit facility. Upon closing, we used the cash equivalent net proceeds, approximately $960 million, to repay debt. As a result
of the split-off, we recorded a gain on discontinued operations of $926 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in 2008.

LU Biscuit Acquisition:

On November 30, 2007, we acquired the Groupe Danone S.A. global

LU

biscuit business (“

LU

Biscuit”) for

€

5.1 billion (approximately $7.6 billion) in cash. The acquisition included 32 manufacturing facilities and approximately 14,000 employees.

LU

Biscuit reports results from operations on a one month lag; accordingly, there was no effect on our 2007 operating results. On a proforma basis,

LU

Biscuit would have contributed net revenues of $2.8 billion during 2007, and

LU

Biscuit’s contribution to net earnings would have been insignificant to Kraft Foods.

See Note 2,

Acquisitions and Divestitures

,
to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these transactions.

Customers

Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 27% of our net revenues in 2009 compared with 27% in 2008 and 29% in 2007. Our ten largest customers accounted
for approximately 36% of our net revenues in 2009 compared with 36% in 2008 and 40% in 2007. One of our customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 16% of our net revenues in 2009 compared with 16% in 2008 and 15% in 2007.

Seasonality

Demand for some of our products
may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other annual events. However, overall sales of our products are generally evenly balanced throughout the year due to the offsetting nature of demands for our diversified product portfolio.


Competition

We face competition in all aspects of our business. Competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies. Some competitors have different profit objectives and some international
competitors are less susceptible to currency exchange rates. We also compete with generic products and retailer brands, wholesalers and cooperatives. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service,
marketing, advertising and price. Moreover, improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures.

Distribution and Marketing

Our products are generally sold to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters,
club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, convenience stores, gasoline stations, drug stores, value stores and other retail food outlets. In general, the retail trade for food products is consolidating. Food products are distributed through
distribution centers, satellite warehouses, company-operated and public cold-storage facilities, depots and other facilities. We currently distribute most products in North America through a combination of direct store delivery and warehouse
delivery. Outside of North America, our products are distributed through warehouse delivery and through the services of independent sales offices and agents.

Our marketing efforts are conducted through three principal sets of activities: (i) consumer marketing in broadcast, print, outdoor and on-line media; (ii) consumer incentives such as coupons and contests; and (iii) trade
promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers.

Raw Materials and Packaging

We are a major purchaser of dairy, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn products, soybean and vegetable oils, nuts, meat products, and sugar and other sweeteners. We also
use significant quantities of plastic, glass and cardboard to package our products, and natural gas for our factories and warehouses. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain
ingredients and packaging needed for production.

We purchase our dairy raw material requirements, including milk and cheese, from independent third
parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. The prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by market supply and demand, as well as by government programs. Dairy commodity costs on average
were lower in 2009 than in 2008. Significant cost items in our biscuit and grocery products are grains (wheat, corn and soybean oil). Grain costs have experienced significant volatility as a result of burgeoning global demand for food, livestock
feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Grain costs on average were relatively flat from 2008 to 2009. The most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans, which are purchased on world markets. Green coffee bean prices
are affected by the quality and availability of supply, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products. Green coffee bean costs on average were lower in 2009 than in 2008. A
significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa, which is purchased on world markets, and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the British pound and the U.S. dollar
relative to certain other currencies. Cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs on average were higher in 2009 than in 2008.

During 2009, our aggregate
commodity costs decreased primarily as a result of lower dairy costs. For 2009, our commodity costs were approximately $150 million lower than 2008, following an increase of approximately $2.0 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. Overall, we
expect commodity costs to continue to be volatile in 2010.

The prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products generally
reflect external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a
result of these factors, we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of price fluctuations in our principal raw
materials. However, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and these strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs.


Intellectual Property

We consider our trademarks, in the aggregate, to be material to our business. We protect our trademarks by registration or otherwise in the U.S. and in other markets where we sell our products. Trademark protection
continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered. Registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. From time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or
more of our trademarks in particular locations. Similarly, we sell some of our products under brands we license from third parties, including at December 31, 2009:

•

Starbucks

coffee,

Seattle’s Best

coffee and

Tazo

teas for sale in U.S. grocery stores and other distribution channels;

•

Starbucks

and

Seattle’s Best

coffee T-Discs and

Tazo

teas T-Discs for use in our

Tassimo

hot beverage system;

•

Capri Sun

packaged juice drinks for sale in the U.S. and Canada;

•

Taco Bell Home Originals

Mexican style food products for sale in U.S. grocery stores; and

•

California Pizza Kitchen

frozen pizzas for sale in U.S. grocery stores.

Additionally, we own numerous patents worldwide. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not
have a material adverse effect on our business. We have either been issued patents or have patent applications pending that relate to a number of current and potential products, including products licensed to others. Patents, issued or applied
for, cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant
and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined
by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We consider that in the aggregate our patent applications, patents and licenses under patents owned by third parties are of material importance to
our operations.

We also have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and related intellectual property rights that are not
registered.

Research and Development

We pursue
four objectives in research and development: product safety and quality; growth through new products; superior consumer satisfaction; and reduced costs. We have approximately 2,300 food scientists, chemists and engineers working primarily in six key
technology centers: East Hanover, New Jersey; Glenview, Illinois; Tarrytown, New York; Banbury, United Kingdom; Paris, France; and Munich, Germany. These technology centers are equipped with pilot plants and state-of-the-art instruments. Research
and development expense was $477 million in 2009, $498 million in 2008 and $442 million in 2007.

Regulation

Our U.S. food products and packaging materials are primarily regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or, for products containing meat and
poultry, the U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These agencies enact and enforce regulations relating to the manufacturing, distribution and labeling of food products.

In addition, various states regulate our U.S. operations by licensing plants, enforcing federal and state standards for selected food products, grading food
products, inspecting plants and warehouses, regulating trade practices related to the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products.

Many of the food commodities we use in our U.S. operations are subject to governmental agricultural programs. These programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to
periodic U.S. Congressional and administrative review.


All of our non-U.S. based operations are subject to local and national regulations, some of which are
similar to those applicable to our U.S. operations. For example, in the European Union, we must comply with requirements that apply to labeling, packaging, food content, pricing, marketing and advertising and related areas.

Environmental Regulation

We are subject to
various federal, state and local laws in the U.S. and laws and regulations outside of the U.S. relating to the protection of the environment. We accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and
can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when recovery of those costs is deemed probable. In
the U.S., the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act 1990, the Clean Water Act 1972, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 1976 and Superfund (the environmental program established to address abandoned hazardous waste sites), which
imposes joint and severable liability on each responsible party. At December 31, 2009, our subsidiaries were involved in 71 active actions in the U.S. under Superfund legislation (and other similar actions) related to current operations
and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability.

Outside the U.S., we are subject to applicable multi-national, national and
local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. Outside the U.S., we have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements.

Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with
environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results. However, we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation actions.

Employees

At December 31, 2009, we employed
approximately 97,000 people worldwide. Labor unions represent approximately 26% of our 40,000 U.S. employees. Most of the unionized workers at our U.S. locations are represented under contracts with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and
Grain Millers International Union; the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union; and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. These contracts expire at various times throughout the next several years. Outside the U.S., labor unions
or workers’ councils represent approximately 60% of our 57,000 employees. Our business units are subject to various laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. These laws and regulations are specific to the
location of each business unit. In addition, in accordance with European Union requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We believe that our relationships with employees
and their representative organizations are good.

In 2008, we completed our five-year restructuring program. As part of the program, we announced the
elimination of approximately 18,600 positions. As of December 31, 2009, we had eliminated approximately 17,300 of those positions.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.

You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant
that may adversely affect our business, performance or financial condition in the future.

We operate in a highly competitive industry, which may
affect our profitability.

The food industry is highly competitive. We compete based on price, product innovation, product quality, brand
recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences.

From time to
time, we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain our market share. Competition and customer pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in


response to commodity and other input cost increases. Our results of operations will suffer if profit margins decrease as a result of a reduction in prices, increased input costs or other
factors, and if we are unable to increase sales volumes to offset those profit margin decreases.

Retailers are increasingly offering retailer
brands that compete with some of our products. It is important that our products provide higher value and / or quality to our consumers than less expensive alternatives. If the difference in value or quality between our products
and those of retailer brands narrows, or if the perceived difference in quality narrows, then consumers may not buy our products. Furthermore, during periods of economic uncertainty, such as we continue to experience,
consumers tend to purchase more retailer brands or other economy brands, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or shift our product mix to our lower margin offerings. If we are not able to maintain or
improve our brand image or value proposition, it could have a material effect on our market share and our profitability.

We may also
need to increase spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation to protect existing market share or increase market share. The success of our investments is subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and
consumer acceptance. As a result, our increased expenditures may not maintain or enhance market share and could result in lower profitability.

The consolidation of retail customers, the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could affect our operating margins, our profitability, our net revenues and our results of
operations.

Retail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors in the U.S., the European Union and our other
major markets, continue to consolidate. These consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power. These larger retailers, capable of operating with reduced inventories, can resist price increases
and demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products. In addition, they may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own retailer brands. The consolidation of retail customers
also increases the risk that a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. Also, our retail customers may be affected by recent economic conditions. For example, they may not have
access to funds or financing and that could cause them to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products, or to not pay us or to delay paying us for previous purchases.

During 2009, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 27% of our net revenues with our largest customer Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounting for approximately 16% of our net revenues. There can
be no assurance that all significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities that they have in the past. The loss of any one of our significant customers or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer
could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and results of operations.

Increased price volatility for commodities we purchase may
affect our profitability.

We are a major purchaser of commodities, including dairy, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn products, soybean and vegetable
oils, nuts, meat products, and sugar and other sweeteners. In addition, we use significant quantities of plastic, glass and cardboard to package our products, and natural gas for our factories and warehouses. Price volatility for
commodities we purchase has increased due to conditions outside of our control, including recent economic conditions, currency fluctuations, availability of supply, weather, consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural
programs. Although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program, continued volatility in the prices of commodities we purchase could increase the costs of our products and services, and
our profitability could suffer.

Our product sales depend on our ability to predict, identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and
demand, and our ability to develop and offer new products rapidly enough to meet those changes.

Consumer preferences for food
products change continually. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences.

If we do not succeed in offering products that appeal to consumers, our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer. We
must be able to distinguish among short-term fads, mid-term trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new
and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales could decline. In addition, because of our varied consumer base, we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we
fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product


categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories, demand for our products will decrease and our profitability could suffer.

Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products
and marketing programs. For example, recently, consumers have been increasingly focused on health and wellness, including weight management and sodium consumption. Although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, we may
not be successful in these efforts. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could decrease demand for our products and adversely affect our profitability.

As a multinational corporation, our operations are subject to additional risks.

We generated approximately 48% of our 2009 net revenues, 49% of our 2008 net revenues and 43% of our 2007 net revenues outside the U.S. The percentage of the combined company’s sales generated outside of the
U.S. will increase in 2010, due to the acquisition of Cadbury and with the anticipated sale of our Frozen Pizza business. With operations in over 70 countries, our operations are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations, including:

•

fluctuations in currency values,

•

unpredictability of foreign currency exchange controls,

•

discriminatory fiscal policies,

•

compliance with a variety of local regulations and laws,

•

changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws,

•

difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions, and

•

greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles.

In addition, certain jurisdictions could impose tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and other similar restrictions on our sales. Moreover, our business operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by
economic changes, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, and other economic or political uncertainties. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of
which could adversely affect our profitability.

If we are unable to expand our operations in certain emerging markets, our growth rate could be
negatively affected.

In 2007, we unveiled our strategies to grow our operations with increased focus on emerging markets, especially Brazil, Russia,
China and other regions of Southeast Asia. The success of our operations depends in part on our ability to grow our business in these and other emerging markets. In some cases, emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility and
greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions. In addition, emerging markets are becoming more competitive as other companies grow globally and local low cost manufacturers expand their production capacities. If we are unable to
increase our business in emerging markets, our market share and profitability could be adversely affected.

We may not be able to consummate proposed
acquisitions or divestitures successfully or integrate acquired businesses successfully.

From time to time, we may evaluate acquisition
candidates that would strategically fit our business objectives. If we are unable to complete acquisitions, or integrate successfully and develop these businesses to realize revenue growth and cost savings, including
recently acquired Cadbury, our financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, from time to time, we divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives, or do not meet our growth or profitability
targets. Our profitability may be affected by either gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses. Also, we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms
favorable to us. Moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures which may reduce our profitability. Finally, our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial,
managerial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, adverse effects on existing business relationships with
suppliers and customers, inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings, potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired
businesses, and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers. Any of these activities could affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.


Business process improvement initiatives to harmonize our systems and processes may fail to operate as designed and
intended.

We regularly implement business process improvement initiatives to harmonize our systems and processes and to optimize our performance.
Our current business process initiatives include, but are not limited to, our reorganization of our European operations, the delivery of a SAP enterprise resource planning application, and the outsourcing of certain administrative functions. If our
business process improvement initiatives fail, our ability to improve existing operations, achieve anticipated cost savings and support future growth could be delayed.

Changes in our debt ratings and the effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit market could adversely affect our borrowing costs and liquidity.

Our debt ratings depend generally on the amount of our debt and our ability to service our debt. A downgrade in our debt ratings, including as a result of incurring
additional debt, would, and disruptions in the commercial paper market or the effects of other volatile economic conditions on the credit market could, reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue. In addition, any of these risks could
raise our borrowing costs for both short-term and long-term debt offerings.

Legal claims, product recalls or other regulatory enforcement actions
could affect our sales, reputation and profitability.

As a large food company that operates in a highly regulated, highly competitive environment
with growing retailer power and a constantly evolving legal and regulatory framework around the world, we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions. Legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising
out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our sales, reputation and profitability.

Further, selling products for human consumption involves inherent risks. We could be required to recall products due to product contamination, spoilage or other adulteration, product misbranding or product tampering.

We may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, or if our products cause injury, illness or death. In addition, our
marketing could be the target of claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us, or a widespread product recall, may
adversely affect our profitability. Moreover, even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful, has no merit or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could adversely affect
our sales, reputation and profitability.

Increased regulation could increase our costs and affect our profitability.

Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign agencies. New regulations and changes to existing regulations are
issued regularly. Increased governmental regulation of the food industry, such as proposed requirements designed to enhance food safety or to regulate imported ingredients, could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability.

Volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and have a negative impact on our operating
results and profitability.

At the end of 2009, the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was $10.6 billion
and assets were $8.9 billion. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements
of those plans. Among other factors, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can (i) affect the level of plan funding; (ii) cause volatility in the net
periodic pension cost; and (iii) increase our future funding requirements. In addition, if we divest certain businesses, we may be required to increase future contributions to the benefit plans and the related net periodic
pension cost could increase.

We expect to make approximately $240 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2010, which is approximately $380
million less than we made in 2009. We also expect that our net pension cost will increase by approximately $50 million to approximately $440 million in 2010. As this disclosure was made as of December 31, 2009, it does not reflect the impacts
of our recent acquisition and divestiture activity. Additionally, volatile economic conditions increase the risk that we may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension
cost beyond 2010.


Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments.

We have received no written comments regarding our quarterly, annual or current reports from the staff of the SEC that remain unresolved.

Item 2.  Properties.

We have 159 manufacturing and processing facilities worldwide. In North America, we have 54 facilities, and outside of North America, we have 105 facilities located in 44 countries. These manufacturing and processing facilities are located
throughout the following territories:

We own 152 and lease 7 of these manufacturing and processing facilities. It is our practice to maintain all of our plants
and properties in good condition, and we believe they are suitable and adequate for our present needs.

We have publicly announced, but not yet
completed, the sale or closure of two facilities in Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, one facility in Latin America and two facilities in Asia Pacific. The numbers above include these facilities.

We also have 313 distribution centers and depots worldwide. We own 38 of these distribution centers and 3 of these depots, and we lease 124 of these distribution
centers and 148 of these depots. In North America, we have 298 distribution centers and depots, more than 75% of which support our direct store delivery systems. Outside North America, we have 15 distribution centers in 10 countries.

These facilities are in good condition, and we believe they have sufficient capacity to meet our distribution needs in the near future. As this disclosure was made as
of December 31, 2009, it does not reflect the impacts of our recent acquisition and divestiture activity.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

We routinely are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and
governmental inspections or investigations (“Legal Matters”) arising in the ordinary course of our business.

Competition authorities in the
European Union have opened various investigations into possible anticompetitive activity in the fast moving consumer goods (“FMCG”) sector, which includes products such as chocolate and coffee. In Germany, the Federal Cartel Office
(“FCO”) is investigating a number of FMCG companies, including Kraft Foods. We are cooperating and in contact with the FCO. At this time, we cannot predict with certainty the course or the outcome of these investigations.

Currently, we do not believe that the ultimate costs to resolve any of the Legal Matters will have a material effect on our financial results.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2009.

Description of the Company

We manufacture and market packaged food products, including snacks, beverages, cheese, convenient meals and various packaged grocery products,
in approximately 160 countries.

Executive Summary

The following executive summary is intended to provide significant highlights of the discussion and analysis that follows.

•

Net revenues in 2009 decreased 3.7% to $40.4 billion. Net revenues in 2008 increased 16.9% to $41.9 billion.

•

Diluted EPS attributable to Kraft Foods increased 6.8% to $2.03 in 2009 and increased 11.8% to $1.90 in 2008. Diluted EPS attributable to Kraft Foods from
continuing operations increased 67.8% to $2.03 in 2009 and decreased 22.4% to $1.21 in 2008.

•

Four priorities will shape our long-term strategy: focusing on growth categories; expanding our footprint in developing markets; expanding our presence in
instant consumption channels; and enhancing margins.

•

On February 2, 2010, we had received acceptances to our offer of 71.73% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Cadbury plc. The combination of
Kraft Foods and Cadbury will create a global powerhouse in snacks, confectionery and quick meals with a rich portfolio of iconic brands. As of February 15, 2010, we had received acceptances of 1,262,356,520 shares representing 91.02%
of the outstanding Cadbury ordinary shares.

•

On February 8, 2010, we issued $9.5 billion of senior unsecured notes at a weighted-average effective rate of 5.364% and are primarily using the net
proceeds ($9,379 million) to finance the Cadbury acquisition.

•

On January 4, 2010, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets of our North American frozen pizza business to Nestlé USA, Inc. for total
consideration of $3.7 billion. The sale, which is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory clearances, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2010.

•

On November 30, 2009, we entered into a revolving credit agreement for a $4.5 billion three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The agreement
replaced our former revolving credit agreement, which was terminated upon the signing of the new agreement.

•

Our $5.0 billion share repurchase authority expired on March 30, 2009. Prior to the expiration, we repurchased 130.9 million shares for $4.3 billion
under the program. We did not repurchase any shares in 2009.

•

In 2008, we completed our $3.0 billion, five-year Restructuring Program. We reversed $85 million in Restructuring Program charges during 2009, and we recorded
charges of $989 million during 2008 and $459 million during 2007.

•

On August 4, 2008, we completed the split-off of the

Post

cereals business. Accordingly, the

Post

cereals business prior period results were
reflected as discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings.

•

On November 30, 2007, we acquired the Groupe Danone S.A. global

LU

biscuit business for

€

5.1 billion (approximately $7.6 billion) in cash.


Discussion and Analysis

Strategy

Our strategy is centered on marketing and developing
leading consumer brands and pursuing growth opportunities consistent with consumer trends in order to deliver shareholder value. Our increasing investment in snacks and quick meals and our portfolio of iconic brands aligns with growing consumer
interest in convenience products and premium brands. Our focus on snacks and confectionery products fits well within our strategy of growth in instant consumption channels. Four priorities will shape our long-term strategy:

•

focusing on growth categories to further transform into a leading snack, confectionery and quick meals company. This is being achieved through exiting lower
growth and / or lower margin businesses and reinvigorating high cash flow businesses to fund growth;

•

expanding our footprint in developing markets to benefit from population growth trends, trading up by consumers and achieving the scale to establish
cost-efficient infrastructure in key geographies;

•

expanding our presence in instant consumption channels in order to gain share versus grocery channels in the U.S. and European Union; and

•

enhancing margins by improving our portfolio mix and reducing costs while investing in quality.

Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Cadbury Acquisition:

On January 19, 2010, we announced the terms of our final offer for each outstanding ordinary share of Cadbury plc (“Cadbury”), including each ordinary share represented by an American Depositary
Share (“Cadbury ADS”), and the Cadbury board of directors recommended that Cadbury shareholders accept the terms of the final offer. Under the terms of the offer, we agreed to pay Cadbury shareholders 500 pence in cash and 0.1874 shares of
Kraft Foods Common Stock per Cadbury ordinary share validly tendered and 2,000 pence in cash and 0.7496 shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock per Cadbury ADS validly tendered. This valued each Cadbury ordinary share at 840 pence and each Cadbury ADS at
£33.60 (based on the closing price of $29.58 for a share of Kraft Foods Common Stock on January 15, 2010 and an exchange rate of $1.63 per £1.00) and valued the entire issued share capital of Cadbury at £11.9 billion
(approximately $19.4 billion) on January 15, 2010, the last trading day before the publication of our final offer. The combination of Kraft Foods and Cadbury will create a global powerhouse in snacks, confectionery and quick meals with a rich
portfolio of iconic brands.

On February 2, 2010, all of the conditions to the offer were satisfied or validly waived, the initial offer period
expired and a subsequent offer period immediately began. At that point, we had received acceptances of 71.73% of the outstanding Cadbury ordinary shares, including those represented by Cadbury ADSs. The subsequent offer period remains open
until further notice and at least 14 days of notice will be given if Kraft Foods decides to close the offer. As of February 15, 2010, we had received acceptances of 1,262,356,520 shares representing 91.02% of the outstanding Cadbury ordinary
shares, including those represented by Cadbury ADSs. As we have received acceptances of over 90% of Cadbury shares, we are in the process of acquiring the remaining Cadbury ordinary shares that are not tendered in the offer, including those
represented by Cadbury ADSs, through a compulsory acquisition procedure under the United Kingdom Companies Act of 2006, as amended. Additionally, as a condition of the EU Commission’s approval of the Cadbury acquisition, we are required to
divest confectionary operations in Poland and Romania. As part of our acquisition of Cadbury, we expensed approximately $40 million in transaction related fees in 2009 as we incurred them, and we also incurred $40 million in financing fees in 2009
related to the acquisition.

Pizza Divestiture

:

On January 4, 2010, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets of our North American frozen pizza business (“Frozen Pizza”) to Nestlé USA, Inc. (“Nestlé”) for total consideration of $3.7 billion.
Our Frozen Pizza business is a component of our U.S. Convenient Meals and Canada & North America Foodservice segments. The sale, which is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory clearances, includes the

DiGiorno

,

Tombstone

and

Jack’s

brands in the U.S., the

Delissio

brand in Canada and the

California Pizza Kitchen

trademark license. It also includes two Wisconsin manufacturing facilities (Medford and Little Chute) and the
leases for the pizza depots and delivery


trucks. It is estimated that approximately 3,400 of our employees will transfer with the business to Nestlé. We anticipate that the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2010.

At December 31, 2009, the Frozen Pizza business did not meet the criteria to be considered held-for-sale. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010,
the results of the Frozen Pizza business will be presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements and prior periods will be restated in a consistent manner. The following reflects the summary results for the Frozen
Pizza business that will be treated as a discontinued operation going forward:


The following assets of the

Post

cereals business were included in the split-off (in millions):

LU Biscuit Acquisition:

On November 30, 2007, we acquired the Groupe Danone S.A. global

LU

biscuit business (“

LU

Biscuit”) for

€

5.1 billion (approximately $7.6 billion) in cash. The acquisition included 32 manufacturing facilities and approximately 14,000 employees. We used borrowings of

€

5.1 billion to finance this acquisition. Interest incurred on these borrowings was the primary driver of the $533 million increase in interest expense from 2007 to 2008.

LU

Biscuit reports results
from operations on a one month lag; accordingly, there was no effect on our 2007 operating results. On a proforma basis,

LU

Biscuit would have contributed net revenues of $2.8 billion during 2007, and

LU

Biscuit’s contribution to
net earnings would have been insignificant to Kraft Foods.

Other Divestitures:

In 2009, we received $41 million in net proceeds and recorded pre-tax losses of $6 million on the divestitures of our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S., a juice operation in Brazil and a plant in Spain. We
recorded after-tax gains of $58 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, on these divestitures, primarily due to the differing book and tax bases of our

Balance

bar operations.

In 2008, we received $153 million in net proceeds, and recorded pre-tax losses of $92 million on divestitures, primarily related to a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and four operations in Spain. We recorded
after-tax losses of $64 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, on these divestitures.

Included in the 2008 divestitures were the following, which were a
condition of the EU Commission’s approval of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition:

•

We divested a biscuit operation in Spain. From this divestiture, we received $86 million in net proceeds and recorded pre-tax losses of $74 million.

•

We divested another biscuit operation in Spain and a trademark in Hungary that we had previously acquired as part of the

LU

Biscuit acquisition. As such,
the impacts of these divestitures were reflected as adjustments to the purchase price allocations.

In 2007, we received $216 million
in net proceeds and recorded pre-tax gains of $14 million on the divestitures of our hot cereal assets and trademarks, our sugar confectionery assets in Romania and related trademarks and our flavored water and juice brand assets and related
trademarks, including

Veryfine

and

Fruit2O

. We recorded an after-tax loss of $5 million on these divestitures to reflect the differing book and tax bases of our hot cereal assets and trademarks divestiture.

The aggregate operating results of the divestitures discussed above, other than the divestiture of the

Post

cereals business, were not material to our
financial statements in any of the periods presented. Refer to Note 16,

Segment Reporting

, for details of the gains and losses on divestitures by segment. The net impacts to segment operating income from gains and losses on divestitures,
along with resulting asset impairment charges, are summarized in the table with the Asset Impairment Charges section below.

Asset Impairment
Charges

In 2009, we recorded aggregate asset impairment charges of $21 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. During our 2009 review of goodwill
and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $12 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands. In addition, during 2009, we recorded a $9 million asset impairment charge to write off an investment in Norway. We
recorded the aggregate asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs.


In 2008, we recorded aggregate asset impairment charges of $140 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. During our 2008
review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $44 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands, France and Puerto Rico. In addition, in December 2008, we reached a preliminary agreement to
divest a juice operation in Brazil and reached an agreement to sell a cheese plant in Australia. In anticipation of divesting the juice operation in Brazil, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The
charge primarily included the write-off of associated intangible assets of $8 million and property, plant and equipment of $4 million. In anticipation of selling the cheese plant in Australia, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $28 million to
property, plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of 2008. Additionally, in 2008, we divested a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation, and incurred an asset impairment charge of $55 million in connection with the divestiture. This charge
primarily included the write-off of associated goodwill of $34 million and property, plant and equipment of $16 million. We recorded the aggregate asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs.

No impairments resulted from our 2007 annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets. Additionally, in 2007, we divested our flavored water and juice
brand assets and related trademarks and incurred an asset impairment charge of $120 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in recognition of the divestiture. The charge primarily included the write-off of associated intangible assets of $70 million
and property, plant and equipment of $47 million and was recorded within asset impairment and exit costs.

The net impacts to segment operating income
from gains and losses on divestitures and the related asset impairment charges recorded when these divestitures were considered held-for-sale are summarized in the table below.

Cost Savings Initiatives

We incurred costs associated with our Cost Savings Initiatives of $318 million in 2009. These charges were recorded in operations, primarily
within the segment operating income of Kraft Foods Europe with the remainder spread across all other segments. The Kraft Foods Europe charges were largely a result of the reorganization of our European operations. Cost Savings Initiatives include
exit, disposal and implementation costs. Even though implementation costs were directly attributable to exit and disposal costs, they did not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. In 2009, our Cost Savings
Initiatives primarily included severance charges for benefits received by terminated employees, associated benefit plan costs and other related activities.

2004-2008 Restructuring Program

In 2008, we completed our five-year restructuring program (the “Restructuring
Program”). The objectives of this program were to leverage our global scale, realign and lower our cost structure, and optimize capacity. As part of the Restructuring Program, we:

•

incurred $3.0 billion in pre-tax charges reflecting asset disposals, severance and implementation costs;

•

announced the closure of 35 facilities and announced the elimination of approximately 18,600 positions;


•

will use cash to pay for $2.0 billion of the $3.0 billion in charges; and

•

anticipate reaching cumulative annualized savings of $1.4 billion for the total program.

In 2009, we reversed $85 million of previously accrued Restructuring Program charges (resulting in a favorable impact to diluted EPS of $0.04). Those reversals
related to the following:

•

We sold a plant in Spain that we previously announced we would close under our Restructuring Program. Accordingly, we reversed $35 million in Restructuring
Program charges, primarily related to severance, and recorded a $17 million loss on the divestiture of the plant in 2009. The reversal occurred in our Kraft Foods Europe segment.

•

We also reversed $50 million in Restructuring Program charges, primarily due to planned position eliminations that did not occur. These were primarily the result
of redeployment and natural attrition. The majority of these reversals occurred in our Kraft Foods Europe segment, with the remainder spread across all other segments.

We incurred charges from continuing operations under the Restructuring Program of $989 million in 2008, or $0.45 per diluted share, and $447 million in 2007, or $0.19 per diluted share. Since the inception of the
Restructuring Program, we have paid cash of $1.7 billion of the $2.0 billion in expected cash payments, including $176 million paid in 2009. At December 31, 2009, we had an accrual of $270 million, and we had eliminated approximately 17,300
positions under the Restructuring Program.

In 2008, we implemented a new operating structure built on three core elements: business units, shared
services that leverage the scale of our global portfolio, and a streamlined corporate staff. Within the new structure, business units now have full P&L accountability and are staffed accordingly. This also ensures that we are putting our
resources closer to where we make decisions that affect our consumers and customers. Our corporate and shared service functions streamlined their organizations to focus on core activities that can more efficiently support the goals of the business
units. The intent was to simplify, streamline and increase accountability, with the ultimate goal of generating reliable growth for Kraft Foods. In total, we eliminated approximately 1,400 positions as we streamlined our headquarter functions.

Under the Restructuring Program, we recorded asset impairment and exit costs from continuing operations of $884 million in 2008 and $320 million in
2007. We recorded implementation costs from continuing operations of $105 million in 2008 and $127 million in 2007. Implementation costs are directly attributable to exit and disposal costs; however, they do not qualify for treatment as exit or
disposal costs under guidance related to accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. These costs primarily include the discontinuance of certain product lines, incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities and the
reorganization of our European operations discussed below. Management believes the disclosure of implementation charges provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our Restructuring Program. Refer to Note
6,

Restructuring Costs

, for details of our Restructuring Program by segment.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 29.4% in 2009, 29.0% in 2008 and 30.2% in 2007. Our 2009 effective tax included net tax benefits of $225 million, primarily due to an
agreement we reached with the IRS on specific matters related to years 2000 through 2003, settlements with various foreign and state tax authorities, the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and the divestiture of our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S.

Our 2008 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $222 million from discrete tax events. Of the
total net tax benefits, approximately $50 million related to fourth quarter corrections of state, federal and foreign tax liabilities and a third quarter reconciliation of our inventory of deferred tax items that resulted in a write-down of our net
deferred tax liabilities. The remaining net tax benefits primarily related to the resolution of various tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. Other discrete tax benefits included the impact from
divestitures of a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and several operations in Spain and the tax benefit from impairment charges taken in 2008. In addition, the 2008 tax rate benefited from foreign earnings taxed below the U.S. federal statutory tax
rate and from the expected tax benefit of 2008 restructuring expenses. These benefits were only partially offset by state tax expense and certain foreign tax costs.


Our 2007 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $184 million, primarily including the effects of dividend
repatriation benefits, foreign joint venture earnings and the effect on foreign deferred taxes from lower foreign tax rates enacted in 2007. The 2007 tax rate also benefited from foreign earnings taxed below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, an
increased domestic manufacturing deduction, and the divestiture of our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks. These benefits were partially offset by state tax expense, tax costs associated with the divestiture of our hot
cereal assets and trademarks and interest income from Altria related to the transfer of our federal tax contingencies.

As a result of our spin-off from
Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”), Altria transferred our federal tax contingencies to our balance sheet and related interest income of $77 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in 2007. Following our spin-off from Altria, we no longer are a
member of the Altria consolidated tax return group, and we file our own federal consolidated income tax returns.

Consolidated Results of Operations

The following discussion compares our consolidated results of operations for 2009 with 2008, and for 2008 with 2007.

Many factors have an impact on the timing of sales to our customers. These factors include, among others, the timing of holidays and other annual or special events,
seasonality, significant weather conditions, timing of our own or customer incentive programs and pricing actions, customer inventory programs and general economic conditions. Our domestic operating subsidiaries report year-end results as of the
last Saturday of the year, and our international operating subsidiaries generally report year-end results two weeks prior to the last Saturday of the year.

2009 compared with 2008


The decrease in net revenues was partially offset by higher input cost-driven pricing. The unfavorable volume/mix
impact on net revenues was driven by volume declines across all reportable segments, except U.S. Beverages and U.S. Convenient Meals, in part due to the discontinuation of less profitable product lines. Unfavorable foreign currency decreased net
revenues by $1,897 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Russian ruble, Canadian dollar, Ukrainian hryvnia, British pound, Brazilian real and Polish zloty. The absence of the 2008 favorable resolution of a
Brazilian value added tax claim and the impact of divestitures also had an unfavorable impact on net revenues.

Operating Income

- Operating
income increased $1,681 million (43.7%) to $5,524 million in 2009, due to the following (in millions):

Higher pricing reflected the carryover impact of 2008 pricing actions, as we recovered some of our cumulative cost increases
from prior years. The favorable volume/mix was driven by strong contributions from Kraft Foods Developing Markets and U.S. Convenient Meals. The decrease in input costs was driven by lower raw material costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing
costs. During 2009, we reversed $85 million in Restructuring Program charges recorded in the prior year, versus the $989 million in Restructuring Program charges recognized in 2008. We recognized gains of $203 million on the change in unrealized
hedging positions in 2009, versus losses of $205 million in 2008. We recorded $6 million of net losses on divestitures in 2009, versus $92 million of net losses on divestitures in 2008. We recorded asset impairment charges of $21 million related to
intangible assets in the Netherlands and to write off an investment in Norway in 2009, versus asset impairment charges of $140 million related to certain international intangible assets, the divestiture of our Nordic and Baltic snacks operation, a
juice operation in Brazil and a cheese plant in Australia that were recorded in 2008. We had $22 million of lower charges from certain legal matters. During 2009, we recorded an additional $50 million of charges for legal matters related to certain
of our European operations (see Part I Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a description of these matters). In 2008, we recorded $72 million in charges for legal matters related to certain of our U.S. and European operations, including U.S. coffee
operations. Total marketing, administration and research costs, as recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings, increased $246 million from 2008. Excluding the impacts of divestitures, foreign currency, charges for certain legal matters and
prior year Restructuring Program costs it increased $694 million over 2008, primarily due to further investments in our brands, including spending on Cost Savings Initiatives, and higher marketing support costs. In addition, unfavorable foreign
currency decreased operating income by $322 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the British pound, euro, Canadian dollar, Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnia, Korean won, Brazilian real, and Polish zloty.

As a result of these changes, operating margin also increased from 9.2% in 2008 to 13.7% in 2009.


Net Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Kraft Foods

- Net earnings attributable to Kraft Foods of
$3,021 million increased by $137 million (4.8%) in 2009. Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Kraft Foods were $2.03 in 2009, up 67.8% from $1.21 in 2008. Diluted EPS attributable to Kraft Foods were $2.03 in 2009, up 6.8%
from $1.90 in 2008, due to the following:


Net Revenues

- Net revenues increased $6,074 million (16.9%) to $41,932 million in 2008, and organic net
revenues increased $2,394 million (6.8%) to $37,818 million as follows. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this Item.

Higher pricing outpaced our input cost increases during the year, as we recovered cumulative cost increases from prior
years. The increase in input costs was primarily related to higher raw material costs. The unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines across most segments within Kraft Foods North America, partially offset by volume/mix gains in Kraft Foods
Developing Markets and Kraft Foods Europe. The increase in unrealized losses on hedging activities primarily related to energy derivatives, including heating oil (used primarily to hedge transportation costs) and natural gas contracts. Our

LU

Biscuit acquisition, net of integration costs, increased operating income by $360 million. Total marketing, administration and research costs, as recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings, increased $1,275 million over the prior year.
Excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency and


charges for legal matters it increased $280 million over the prior year. The net impact of losses on divestitures and asset impairments had an unfavorable impact of $126 million on operating
income versus the prior year. The charges for legal matters related to certain of our U.S. and European operations, including U.S. coffee operations. Charges for legal matters were recorded within marketing, administration and research costs. In
addition, foreign currency increased operating income by $61 million, due primarily to the strength of the Brazilian real, euro, Polish zloty and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar.

As a result of these changes, operating margin also decreased from 11.6% in 2007 to 9.2% in 2008.

Net Earnings
and Earnings per Share Attributable to Kraft Foods

- Net earnings attributable to Kraft Foods of $2,884 million increased by $163 million (6.0%) in 2008. Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Kraft Foods were $1.21 in 2008,
down 22.4% from $1.56 in 2007. Diluted EPS attributable to Kraft Foods were $1.90, up 11.8% from $1.70 in 2007, due to the following:

Results of Operations by Business Segment

We manage and report operating results through three geographic units, Kraft Foods North America, Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets. We manage the operations of Kraft Foods North America and
Kraft Foods Europe by product category, and we manage the operations of Kraft Foods Developing Markets by location. Our reportable segments are U.S. Beverages, U.S. Cheese, U.S. Convenient Meals, U.S. Grocery, U.S. Snacks, Canada & N.A.
Foodservice, Kraft Foods Europe (formerly known as European Union) and Kraft Foods Developing Markets.

Effective January 2009, we began implementing
changes to our operating structure based on our

Organizing For Growth

initiative and the Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization. In line with our strategies, we are reorganizing our European operations to function on a pan-European centralized
category management and value chain model, and we changed how we work in Europe in two key ways:

•

We transitioned our European Biscuit, Chocolate, Coffee and Cheese categories to fully integrated business units, further strengthening our focus on these core
categories. To ensure decisions are made


faster and closer to our customers and consumers, each category is fully accountable for its financial results, including marketing, manufacturing and R&D. Category leadership, based in
Zurich, Switzerland, reports to the Kraft Foods Europe President. These business units now comprise the Kraft Foods Europe segment.

•

We aligned the reporting of our Central Europe operations into our Kraft Foods Developing Markets segment to help build critical scale in these countries. We
operate a country-led model in these markets.

The following discussion compares our results of operations for each of our reportable
segments for 2009 with 2008, and for 2008 with 2007.

As discussed in Note 16,

Segment Reporting

, management uses segment operating income to evaluate segment performance
and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of
cost of sales), certain components of our U.S. pension plan cost (which is a component of cost of sales and marketing, administration and research costs), general corporate expenses (which are a component of marketing, administration and research
costs) and amortization of intangibles for all periods presented. In 2009, we began excluding certain components of our U.S. pension plan cost from segment operating income because we centrally manage pension plan funding decisions and the
determination of discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions. Therefore, we allocate only the service cost component of our U.S. pension plan expense to segment operating income. We exclude the unrealized
gains and losses on hedging activities from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Once realized, the gains and losses on hedging activities are recorded within segment operating results.


In 2009, unrealized gains on hedging activities of $203 million primarily resulted from the 2008 unrealized losses on
energy derivatives becoming realized in 2009. In 2008, unrealized losses on hedging activities of $205 million were primarily related to energy derivatives, including heating oil (used primarily to hedge transportation costs) and natural gas
contracts. In 2009, general corporate expenses included $50 million of charges for legal matters related to certain of our European operations (see Part I Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a description of these matters). In 2008, we recorded $72
million in charges for legal matters related to certain of our U.S. and European operations, including U.S. coffee operations and represented the primary reason general corporate expenses increased $101 million in 2008.

We incurred costs associated with our Cost Savings Initiatives of $318 million in 2009. These charges were recorded in operations, primarily within the segment
operating income of Kraft Foods Europe with the remainder spread across all other segments. In 2009, we also reversed $85 million of Restructuring Program costs, with the majority relating to our Kraft Foods Europe segment while the remainder was
spread across all other segments. We incurred Restructuring Program costs of $989 million in 2008 and $459 million in 2007. Refer to Note 6,

Restructuring Costs

, for a breakout of the 2008 and 2007 charges by segment. We also
incurred asset impairment charges of $21 million in 2009 related to our Kraft Foods Europe segment, $140 million in 2008 related to our Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets segments, and $120 million in 2007 related to our U.S.
Beverages segment. Refer to Note 5,

Goodwill and Intangible

Assets

, for further details of these charges.

U.S. Beverages

2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues increased $56 million (1.9%), due to favorable volume/mix (1.3 pp) and higher net pricing (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven by higher shipments in ready-to-drink and powdered beverages.
Ready-to-drink beverages grew from successful quality and marketing investments in

Capri Sun,

partially offset by the discontinuation of less profitable ready-to-drink product lines. Powdered beverages volume increased primarily due to strong
gains in

Kool-Aid

and

Tang.

Coffee volume declined as gains in

Maxwell House, Starbucks

and

Tassimo

were more than offset by declines in

Gevalia.

These favorable factors were partially offset by unfavorable mix
driven by the higher ready-to-drink volume. Higher net pricing was primarily related to ready-to-drink beverages, partially offset by lower input cost-driven pricing in coffee.

Segment operating income increased $130 million (34.1%), due primarily to lower costs due to the completion of the Restructuring Program, lower raw material costs, higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix (higher
shipments, net of unfavorable product mix), lower manufacturing costs and lower marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by higher marketing support costs.

2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $11 million (0.4%), due to higher net pricing (4.9 pp),
partially offset by the impact of divestitures (2.4 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (2.1 pp). Higher net pricing reflected input cost-driven pricing in coffee and lower promotional spending in ready-to-drink beverages. Unfavorable
volume/mix was driven by lower shipments, partially offset by improved product mix due to growth in

Tassimo

. Lower shipments were driven by declines in ready-to-drink beverages, primarily

Capri Sun

, partially offset by gains in
powdered beverages, primarily

Country Time

and

Kool-Aid

, and

Maxwell House

mainstream coffee.


Segment operating income increased $35 million (10.1%), due primarily to higher net pricing, a 2007 asset impairment
charge related to our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks, the impact of divestitures and lower manufacturing costs. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher Restructuring Program
costs, unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs.

U.S. Cheese


2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues increased $256 million (6.0%), due to favorable volume/mix (4.6 pp) and higher net pricing (1.4 pp). Net revenues increased in meats, primarily due to higher net pricing (increased input
cost-driven pricing, net of increased promotional spending). Also, volume increased due to higher shipments in bacon, cold cuts and hot dogs, partially offset by the discontinuation of less profitable product lines. In pizza, net revenues increased
due to the volume growth in our

DiGiorno

and

California Pizza

Kitchen

premium brands, as well as growth in our

Jack’s

and

Tombstone

pizza

brands, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the
discontinuation of less profitable product lines. This was partially offset by lower net pricing driven by increased promotional spending.

Segment
operating income increased $171 million (50.4%), due primarily to favorable volume/mix (higher shipments and improved product mix), higher net pricing, lower raw material costs, lower costs due to the completion of the Restructuring Program and
lower manufacturing costs. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher marketing support costs and higher marketing, administration and research costs.

Frozen Pizza Divestiture -

On January 4, 2010, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets of our Frozen Pizza business to Nestlé for total consideration of $3.7 billion. The sale, which is
subject to customary conditions, including regulatory clearances, includes the

DiGiorno

,

Tombstone

and

Jack’s

brands in the U.S., the

Delissio

brand in Canada and the

California Pizza Kitchen

trademark
license.

U.S. pizza net revenues increased $174 million (13.5%) to $1,467 million in 2009, due to favorable volume/mix (15.4 pp), partially offset
by lower net pricing (1.9 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven by volume gains in

DiGiorno

and

California Pizza Kitchen

premium brands, as well as growth in our

Jack’s

and

Tombstone

pizza brands. This was
partially offset by lower net pricing driven by increased promotional spending. Canada pizza net revenues were $165 million in 2009.

U.S. pizza segment
operating income increased $62 million (29.0%) to $276 million in 2009, due primarily to favorable volume/mix (higher shipments and improved product mix), lower raw material costs and lower manufacturing costs. These favorable factors were
partially offset by higher marketing support costs, higher marketing, administration and research costs and lower net pricing. Canada pizza segment operating income was $65 million in 2009.

The combined segment operating income for Frozen Pizza as presented excludes stranded overheads of $108.

2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $335 million
(8.6%), due to higher net pricing (5.6 pp) and favorable volume/mix (3.0 pp). Net revenues increased in meats due to higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing in sandwich meats,

Lunchables

and hot dogs. Also contributing to
meats net revenue growth was higher shipments of bacon, as well as new product introductions, including

Oscar Mayer Deli Creations

sandwiches (flatbreads) and

Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh

meats (shaved singles and carved). In pizza, net
revenues increased due to higher input cost-driven pricing, net of increased promotional spending, volume growth in

DiGiorno

and

California Pizza Kitchen

premium brands and the launch of the

For One

product line of individual
size pizzas.

Segment operating income increased $20 million (6.3%), due primarily to higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix and lower marketing
support costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher marketing, administration and research costs, higher manufacturing costs and higher Restructuring Program costs.


U.S. Grocery


2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues decreased $61 million (1.2%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (1.7 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (0.7 pp). Biscuits net revenues increased,
driven by higher input cost-driven pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix (unfavorable product mix, net of higher shipments). Biscuits volume gain was due to higher shipments primarily in

Ritz

crackers,

Oreo

cookies,

Triscuit

crackers and

Chips Ahoy!

cookies. Snack bars net revenues decreased, primarily due to volume declines in breakfast bars. Snack nuts net revenues decreased, primarily driven by lower net pricing, due to higher promotional
spending, and unfavorable volume/mix reflecting lower volume due primarily to the recall of certain products containing pistachios in March 2009.

Segment operating income increased $85 million (13.3%), due primarily to lower costs due to the completion of the Restructuring Program, lower marketing support costs, lower manufacturing costs, higher net pricing, the gain on the
divestiture of our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S. and lower marketing, administration and research costs. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher raw material costs and unfavorable volume/mix (unfavorable product mix and
lower shipments, including the recall of certain products containing pistachios).

2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $146 million (3.0%), due to higher net pricing (8.4 pp) and the impact of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition (0.4 pp), partially offset by
unfavorable volume/mix (5.6 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.2 pp). Biscuits net revenues increased, driven by higher input cost-driven pricing and lower promotional spending, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Biscuits unfavorable
volume/mix was driven by base business volume declines in

Wheat Thins

crackers

, Cheese Nips

crackers and

Chips Ahoy!

cookies, partially offset by gains in

Oreo

cookies as well as new product introductions including

Kraft

macaroni and cheese crackers and

Nilla Cakesters

snack cakes. Snack bars net revenues decreased, driven by volume declines in breakfast bars, primarily due to product pruning. Snack nuts net revenues decreased, driven by lower
volume, partially offset by higher net pricing.

Segment operating income decreased $78 million (10.9%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (lower shipments
and unfavorable mix), higher raw material costs, higher manufacturing costs, higher Restructuring Program costs, higher marketing, administration and research costs, a 2007 gain on the divestiture of our hot cereal assets and trademarks and the
impact of divestitures. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by higher net pricing and lower marketing support costs.

Canada & N.A. Foodservice

2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues decreased $207 million (4.8%), due to the significant impact of unfavorable foreign currency (4.6 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.2 pp). In Canada, net revenues increased, driven by volume gains across all retail
businesses and higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency. In N.A. Foodservice, net revenues decreased, driven by lower volume, due to industry-wide declines in restaurant traffic and the discontinuation of less profitable
product lines, lower input cost-driven pricing and unfavorable foreign currency.

Segment operating income increased $79 million (17.6%), due primarily
to lower costs due to the completion of the Restructuring Program and lower raw material costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency, higher manufacturing costs and higher marketing support costs.


2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $214 million (5.2%), due primarily to higher net pricing (3.9 pp), favorable foreign currency (1.3 pp) and favorable volume/mix (0.3 pp), partially offset by the impact of divestitures
(0.4 pp). In Canada, net revenues growth was primarily driven by volume gains across all retail businesses, favorable foreign currency and higher net pricing. In N.A. Foodservice, net revenues increased, primarily driven by higher input cost-driven
pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix.

Segment operating income increased $5 million (1.1%), due primarily to higher net pricing, lower
manufacturing costs, lower marketing, administration and research costs, favorable volume/mix (higher shipments, net of unfavorable mix) and favorable foreign currency. These favorable variances were partially offset by higher raw material costs,
higher Restructuring Program costs and higher marketing support costs.

Kraft Foods Europe

2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues decreased $960 million (9.9%), due to the significant impact of unfavorable foreign currency (6.7 pp), unfavorable volume/mix (2.8 pp) and the impact of divestitures (2.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing
(1.8 pp). Unfavorable foreign currency primarily reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and British pound. In addition, volume declines in coffee, biscuits, chocolate and cheese and the discontinuation of less profitable product
lines drove net revenues lower. These unfavorable revenue drivers were partially offset by higher net pricing, primarily in chocolate, coffee and biscuits.

Segment operating income increased $603 million (100+%), due to lower costs due to the completion of the Restructuring Program (including the reversal of prior year costs), higher net pricing, the 2008 net loss on the divestitures of
several operations in Spain, 2008 asset impairment charges related to certain international intangible assets and the divestiture of our Nordic and Baltic snacks operation, lower manufacturing costs and lower raw material costs. These favorable
variances were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency, higher marketing support costs, higher non-recurring costs associated with the Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization, higher marketing, administration and research costs (primarily
spending on Cost Savings Initiatives), asset impairment charges related to certain intangible assets in the Netherlands and to write off an investment in Norway, the net loss on the divestiture of a plant in Spain, unfavorable volume/mix (lower
shipments, net of improved product mix) and the impact of divestitures.

2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $2,721 million (38.8%), due to the impact of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition (33.1 pp), favorable foreign currency (5.5 pp) and higher net
pricing (4.7 pp), partially offset by the impact of divestitures (3.5 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (1.0 pp). Higher input cost-driven pricing was partially offset by higher promotional spending. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in
coffee and cheese shipments, partially offset by gains in chocolate.

Segment operating income decreased $273 million (60.0%), due primarily to higher
raw material costs, higher Restructuring Program costs, the net loss on the divestitures of several operations in Spain, asset impairment charges related to certain international intangible assets and the divestiture of our Nordic and Baltic snacks
operation, higher marketing, administration and research costs and the impact of divestitures. These unfavorable


variances were partially offset by higher net pricing, the impact of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition (net of associated integration costs), lower manufacturing costs, lower marketing support
costs and favorable volume/mix (improved mix, net of lower shipments).

Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization -

The reorganization of our European
operations to function on a pan-European centralized category management and value chain model was completed in 2009 for our Chocolate, Coffee and Cheese categories. Significant progress was made in 2009 related to the integration of our Europe
Biscuits business, and we expect the integration to be completed by mid-2010. The European Principal Company (“EPC”) will manage the European categories centrally and make decisions for all aspects of the value chain, except for sales and
distribution. The European subsidiaries will execute sales and distribution locally, and the local production companies will act as toll manufacturers on behalf of the EPC. The EPC legal entity has been incorporated as Kraft Foods Europe GmbH in
Zurich, Switzerland. As part of the reorganization, we incurred $32 million of severance costs, $25 million of implementation costs and $56 million of other non-recurring costs during 2009; we incurred $16 million of restructuring costs, $39 million
of implementation costs and $11 million of other non-recurring costs during 2008; and we incurred $21 million of restructuring costs, $24 million of implementation costs and $10 million of other non-recurring costs during 2007. Through 2009, we have
incurred charges of $241 million related to our Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization, including the above mentioned costs. We expect to incur approximately $40 million in additional charges in 2010 to complete the integration of the Europe Biscuits
business. In 2009, these charges were recorded within cost of sales and marketing, administration and research costs. The 2008 and 2007 restructuring and implementation costs were recorded as part of our overall Restructuring Program. Other
non-recurring costs relating to our Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization were recorded as marketing, administration and research costs. Management believes the disclosure of implementation and other non-recurring charges provides readers of our
financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization.

Kraft Foods Developing Markets

2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues decreased $292 million (3.5%), due to the significant impact of unfavorable foreign currency (12.9 pp), the absence of the 2008 favorable resolution of a Brazilian value added tax claim (0.8 pp) and the impact of divestitures
(0.5 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (8.9 pp) and favorable volume/mix (1.8 pp). In Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, net revenues decreased, driven primarily by unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by higher
net pricing across most of the region and favorable volume/mix (improved product mix, net of lower shipments). In Latin America, net revenues increased, primarily driven by higher net pricing across the region and favorable volume/mix (lower
shipments, net of improved product mix), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency and the absence of the 2008 favorable resolution of a Brazilian value added tax claim. In Asia Pacific, net revenues increased, due to higher net pricing
across most of the region and favorable volume/mix (improved product mix, net of lower shipments), primarily in China, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency.

Segment operating income increased $121 million (14.8%), due primarily to higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix (improved product mix, net of lower shipments), lower costs due to the completion of the
Restructuring Program (including the reversal of prior year costs) and 2008 asset impairment charges related to certain international intangible assets, a juice operation in Brazil and a cheese plant in Australia. These favorable variances were
partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher manufacturing costs, unfavorable foreign currency, higher marketing, administration and research costs, higher marketing support costs and the absence of the 2008 favorable resolution of a
Brazilian value added tax claim.


Venezuela -

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Venezuelan economy was classified as highly inflationary under
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Effective January 1, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiary is being accounted for under highly inflationary accounting rules, which principally means
all transactions are recorded in U.S. dollars. Venezuela has three exchange rates: the official rate, the consumer staples rate and the secondary (or parallel) rate. We have historically used and will continue to use the official rate to translate
our Venezuelan operations. However, prior to this change in accounting, cash that we had exchanged into U.S. dollars using the secondary market was carried at that rate. Upon the change to highly inflationary accounting, we were required to
translate our U.S. dollars on hand using the official rate. Additionally, on January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency. Accordingly, we were required to revalue our net assets in Venezuela and we recorded an insignificant
loss, which will be reflected in our first quarter 2010 results. We expect our 2010 operating results to be negatively impacted by $75 million to $100 million as a result of the aforementioned devaluation. This disclosure does not reflect the
impacts of our recent acquisition activity.

2008 compared with 2007:

Net revenues increased $2,273 million (38.0%), due primarily to the impact of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition (15.9 pp), higher net pricing (11.0 pp), favorable volume/mix (5.4 pp), favorable foreign currency
(4.7 pp) and the favorable resolution of a Brazilian value added tax claim (1.1 pp). In Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa, net revenues increased, driven by higher net pricing across the region, volume growth in
chocolate, biscuits and coffee categories, our

LU

Biscuit acquisition and favorable foreign currency. In Latin America, net revenues increased, driven by favorable foreign currency, higher net pricing, the favorable resolution of a value
added tax claim and favorable volume/mix in Brazil; higher net pricing and improved product mix in Argentina; and higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix in Venezuela. In Asia Pacific, net revenues increased due primarily to our

LU

Biscuit acquisition, higher net pricing across the region and favorable foreign currency.

Segment operating income increased $227 million
(38.6%) due to higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix, the impact of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition (net of associated integration costs), the favorable resolution of a Brazilian value added tax claim, and favorable foreign currency. These
favorable variances were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher manufacturing costs, higher marketing, administration and research costs, higher Restructuring Program costs, higher marketing support costs, 2008 asset impairment
charges related to certain international intangible assets, a juice operation in Brazil and a cheese plant in Australia and a 2007 gain on the divestiture of our sugar confectionery assets in Romania and related trademarks.

Critical Accounting Policies

Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed
the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our
consolidated financial statements.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include Kraft Foods, as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. Our domestic operating subsidiaries report year-end results as of the last Saturday of the
year, and our international operating subsidiaries generally report year-end results two weeks prior to the last Saturday of the year.

We account for
investments in which we exercise significant influence (20% - 50% ownership interest) under the equity method of accounting. We use the cost method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20% and in
which we do not exercise significant influence. Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries consists of the equity interest of noncontrolling investors in consolidated subsidiaries of Kraft Foods. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.

Use of Estimates:

We prepare our financial
statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our financial statements. Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others,
pension and benefit plan assumptions, lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, marketing programs and income taxes. We base our estimates on


historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the
period in which we know the actual amounts. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market. We record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes. Effective January 1, 2009, we changed our method of valuing our U.S. inventories to the average cost method. In prior
years, principally all U.S. inventories were valued using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. We believe that the average cost method of accounting for U.S. inventories is preferable and will improve financial reporting by better
matching revenues and expenses to current costs, by better aligning our external reporting with our competitors, and by aligning our external reporting with our tax basis of accounting. The financial statements for all periods presented were
conformed to the change in accounting policy. With this change, we value all of our inventories using the average cost method.

Refer to Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

, to the consolidated financial statements for further details of this change in accounting policy.

Long-Lived Assets:

We review long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment when conditions exist that
indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing assets held for use for impairment, we group assets and liabilities at
the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated
proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets at least annually for impairment. We have recognized goodwill in our reporting units, which are generally one level below our operating segments. We use a two
step process to test goodwill at the reporting unit level. The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows of the reporting unit
based on planned growth rates, and estimates of discount rates and residual values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the second step of the process is necessary. The second step measures the difference between the carrying value and
implied fair value of goodwill. To test non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment, we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. Fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets is determined using our planned
growth rates, and estimates of discount rates and royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated
useful lives.

We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets as of October 1 each year. The basis of
our valuation methodology for estimating the fair value of our 20 reporting units is a 20-year projection of discounted cash flows that is based on our annual strategic planning process. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units
requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic conditions. For our reporting units within our Kraft Foods North America and Kraft Foods Europe geographic units, we used a market-participant,
weighted-average cost of capital of 7.5% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our reporting units within our Kraft Foods Developing Markets geographic unit, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 10.5%.


As a result of our 2009 annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $12 million
charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands. During our 2009 impairment review, we also noted that the following three reporting units were the most sensitive to near-term changes in our discounted cash flow assumptions:

Each of our reporting units passed the first step of our 2009 annual impairment review with an estimated fair value greater
than 110% of its carrying value. Looking past 2009, there are uncertainties within the three identified reporting units that could potentially require further analysis in the future in order for us to determine if a goodwill impairment exists within
any of the individual reporting units. Significant uncertainties are:

•

Continued economic uncertainty may lead customers to purchase more retailer brands or other economy brands, which could reduce sales volumes of
our products or shift our product mix to our lower margin offerings. If we are not able to maintain or improve our brand image or value proposition, it could have a material effect on our market share and our
profitability. As we primarily use a forecasted discounted cash flow model based on segment operating income, a material decrease in profitability would adversely affect our estimated fair value of any of these reporting units.

•

Our U.S. Salty Snacks business has experienced volume declines over the past year. If this trend were to continue or worsen, it would adversely affect the
estimated fair value of U.S. Salty Snacks reporting unit.

•

Our N.A. Foodservice business is heavily dependent on the restaurant industry, which has been negatively impacted by the recent recession. Continued
industry-wide declines in restaurant traffic would adversely affect the estimated fair value of the N.A. Foodservice reporting unit.

•

Our Europe Biscuits business is primarily made up of the western European part of our 2007

LU

Biscuit acquisition. Shortly after our acquisition, the
economic environment in Europe deteriorated and ultimately lead to a recessionary period. If general economic conditions continue to worsen, it would adversely affect the estimated fair value of our Europe Biscuits reporting unit.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed the annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and recorded a
$44 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands, France and Puerto Rico. During our 2008 impairment review, we determined that our Europe Biscuits reporting unit was the most sensitive to near-term changes in our
discounted cash flow assumptions, as it contains a significant portion of the goodwill recorded upon our 2007 acquisition of

LU

Biscuit.

Insurance and Self-Insurance:

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’
compensation, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and our obligation for employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience and other actuarial
assumptions.

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize
revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods. Revenues are recorded net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to
customers. Kraft Foods’ shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. A provision for product returns and allowances for bad debts are also recorded as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is
recognized.

Marketing Costs:

We promote our
products with advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. We expense advertising costs either in the
period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Consumer incentive


and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates
principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated volume and related expense for the full
year. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.

Environmental Costs:

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We accrue for environmental
remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third
parties are recorded as assets when recovery of those costs is deemed probable. At December 31, 2009, our subsidiaries were involved in 71 active actions in the U.S. under Superfund legislation (and other similar actions) related to
current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability.

Based on information currently available, we believe that
the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results. However, we cannot quantify with certainty the
potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation actions.

Employee Benefit Plans:

In September 2006, new guidance was issued surrounding employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The new guidance
required us to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date beginning in 2008. We previously measured our non-U.S. pension plans (other than certain Canadian and French pension plans) at September 30 of each year. On
December 31, 2008, we recorded an after-tax decrease of $8 million to retained earnings using the 15-month approach to proportionally allocate the transition adjustment required upon adoption of the measurement provision of the new guidance.
The plan assets and benefit obligations of our pension plans and the benefit obligations of our postretirement plans are now all measured at year-end.

We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits, consisting primarily of severance. We record amounts relating to these
plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP. These calculations require the use of various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost
trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize any effect of the modifications over
future periods. We believe that the assumptions used in recording our plan obligations are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries. Refer to Note 11,

Benefit Plans

, to the consolidated financial statements for a
discussion of the assumptions used.

We recorded the following amounts in earnings for these employee benefit plans during the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:


The 2009 net expense for employee benefit plans of $912 million decreased by $308 million over the 2008
amount. The cost decrease primarily related to lower postemployment benefit plan costs as we completed our five-year Restructuring Program in 2008, partially offset by higher pension plan costs, including a lower expected return on plan assets and
higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences. The 2008 net expense for employee benefit plans of $1,220 million increased by $343 million over the 2007 amount. The cost increase primarily related to higher postemployment
benefit plan costs related to the Restructuring Program, partially offset by lower pension plan costs, including lower amortization of the net loss from experience differences.

We plan to make contributions of approximately $40 million to our U.S. pension plans and approximately $200 million to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2010. Our estimated pension contributions do not
include anticipated contributions for our newly acquired Cadbury business. We will update this figure in future filings to reflect these anticipated contributions. Our actual contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many
factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates. For our U.S. qualified pension plans, we are not currently required to make any U.S.
pension plan contributions under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 in 2010.

We expect our 2010 net expense for employee benefit plans to increase by
approximately $40 million. The increase is primarily due to higher forecasted non-U.S. pension plan costs due to plan assumption changes, partially offset by lower forecasted postemployment benefit plan costs. Our non-U.S. pension plan costs will be
higher primarily due to a weighted-average decrease of 120 basis points in our discount rate assumption. As this disclosure was made as of December 31, 2009, it does not reflect the impacts of our recent acquisition and divestiture activity.

We will be freezing our U.S. pension plans for current salaried and non-union hourly employees effective December 31, 2019. Pension accruals for
all salaried and non-union employees who are currently earning pension benefits will end on December 31, 2019, and continuing pay and service will be used to calculate the pension benefits through December 31, 2019. Our projected benefit
obligation decreased $168 million in 2009, and we incurred a $5 million curtailment charge in 2009 related to the freeze. We expect the freeze to lower our annual U.S. pension plan costs by approximately $40 million beginning in 2010. Additionally,
for salaried and non-union hourly employees hired in the U.S. after January 1, 2009, we discontinued benefits under our U.S. pension plans, and we replaced them with an enhanced company contribution to our employee savings plan. We do not
expect this to have a significant impact on our 2010 pension plan cost.

Our 2010 health care cost trend rate assumption remained unchanged at 7.00% for
our U.S. postretirement plans and remained unchanged at 9.00% for our Canadian postretirement plans. We established these rates based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward. We anticipate
that our health care cost trend rate assumption will be 5.00% for U.S. plans by 2014 and 6.00% for Canadian plans by 2016. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A
one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects as of December 31, 2009:

Our 2010 discount rate assumption decreased to 5.70% from 6.10% for our U.S. postretirement plans and decreased
to 5.25% from 7.60% for our Canadian postretirement plans. Our 2010 discount rate decreased to 5.93% from 6.10% for our U.S. pension plans. We model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations
that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations. Our 2010 discount rate assumption for our non-U.S. pension plans decreased to 5.21% from 6.41%. We developed the discount rates for our non-U.S. plans from local bond indices that
match local benefit obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year.

Our 2010 expected rate of return on plan assets remained unchanged at 8.00% for our U.S. pension plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current
asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. We attempt to


maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments. We intend to rebalance our plan portfolios by
mid-2010 by making contributions and monthly benefit payments.

While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2010 assumptions for our U.S. and
non-U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rate or a fifty-basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase /
(decrease) in cost, as of December 31, 2009:

Financial Instruments:

As we operate globally, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our
risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain foreign currency, commodity price
and interest rate risk management strategies that seek to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates, principally through the use of
derivative instruments.

Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging
instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies
for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically
identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur. If we deem it probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, we recognize the gain or loss in earnings currently.

By using derivatives to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and commodity prices, we have exposure on these derivatives to credit and market risk. We are
exposed to credit risk that the counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with investment
grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. In October 2008, one of our counterparties, Lehman Brothers Commercial Corporation, filed for
bankruptcy. Consequently, we wrote off an insignificant asset related to derivatives held with them. This did not have a significant impact on our foreign currency risk management program. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant,
non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration greater than one year be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument might be adversely
affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments and
derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that may be undertaken by the use of derivative instruments.

We record derivative financial
instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either current assets or current liabilities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is
effective, are recorded each period either in accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) or in earnings. Gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in


accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) are reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods in which operating results are affected by the hedged item.
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a fair value hedge, along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current
period earnings. Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Income Taxes:

Prior to our spin-off from Altria, we were included in Altria’s consolidated federal income tax return. We generally
computed income taxes on a separate company basis; however, some of our foreign tax credits, capital losses and other credits could not be used on a separate company basis. To the extent that Altria used our foreign tax credits and other tax
benefits in its consolidated federal income tax return, we recognized the benefit in the calculation of our provision for income taxes. This benefit was approximately $270 million in 2007. We made payments to, or were reimbursed by, Altria for the
tax effects resulting from being included in Altria’s tax return. As of March 31, 2007, we were no longer a member of the Altria consolidated tax return group. We file our own federal consolidated income tax returns.

In July 2006, new guidance was issued which addressed accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2007. The
guidance clarified when tax benefits should be recorded in the financial statements and provided measurement criteria for valuing such benefits. In order for us to recognize benefits, our tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained
upon audit. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Before the implementation of this guidance, we established additional provisions
for certain positions that were likely to be challenged even though we believe that those existing tax positions were fully supportable. The adoption of this guidance resulted in an increase to equity as of January 1, 2007 of
$213 million.

We recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Commodity Trends

We are a major purchaser of dairy, coffee, cocoa, wheat,
corn products, soybean and vegetable oils, nuts, meat products, and sugar and other sweeteners. We also use significant quantities of plastic, glass and cardboard to package our products, and natural gas for our factories and warehouses. We
continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production.

We purchase our dairy raw material requirements, including milk and cheese, from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. The prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially
influenced by market supply and demand, as well as by government programs. Dairy commodity costs on average were lower in 2009 than in 2008. Significant cost items in our biscuit and grocery products are grains (wheat, corn and soybean oil). Grain
costs have experienced significant volatility as a result of burgeoning global demand for food, livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Grain costs on average were relatively flat from 2008 to 2009. The most significant cost item
in coffee products is green coffee beans, which are purchased on world markets. Green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to certain other currencies and
consumer demand for coffee products. Green coffee bean costs on average were lower in 2009 than in 2008. A significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa, which is purchased on world markets, and the price of which is affected by
the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the British pound and the U.S. dollar relative to certain other currencies. Cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs on average were higher in 2009 than in 2008.

During 2009, our aggregate commodity costs decreased primarily as a result of lower dairy costs. For 2009, our commodity costs were approximately $150 million lower
than 2008, following an increase of approximately $2.0 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. Overall, we expect commodity costs to continue to be volatile in 2010.


Liquidity

We believe that our cash from operations, our existing $4.5 billion revolving credit facility (which supports our commercial paper program) and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity
to meet our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. We continue to utilize our commercial paper program and primarily uncommitted international credit
lines for daily funding requirements. We also use short-term intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on
our liquidity.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:

Operating activities provided net cash of $5.1 billion in 2009, $4.1 billion in 2008 and $3.6 billion in 2007. The increase in operating cash flows in 2009 primarily related to working capital improvements
over the prior year (primarily due to improved inventory positions, partially offset by higher interest payments, principally due to the first annual payment on our euro notes) and higher earnings. The increase in operating cash flows was partially
offset by higher pension contributions, driven by total voluntary contributions of $400 million that we made to our U.S. pension plans in May and December 2009.

Operating cash flows increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to increased earnings and working capital improvements (mainly from lower income tax payments and lower inventory levels), partially offset by increased interest paid. The
increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by a $305 million tax transfer from Altria in 2007 for the federal tax contingencies held by them, less the impact of federal reserves reversed due to the adoption of new guidance which addressed
accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes. The transfer from Altria was reflected as a component of the change in other current assets within the net cash provided by operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows.

We anticipate making U.S. pension contributions of approximately $40 million in 2010 and non-U.S. pension contributions of approximately $200
million in 2010. We expect to fund these contributions from operations. Our estimated pension contributions do not include anticipated contributions for our newly acquired Cadbury business. We will update this figure in future filings to reflect
these anticipated contributions.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities:

One element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolios and / or expand our geographic reach through disciplined programs of selective acquisitions and divestitures. We are regularly reviewing
potential acquisition candidates and from time to time sell businesses to accelerate the shift in our portfolio toward businesses—whether global, regional or local - that offer us a sustainable competitive advantage. The impact of future
acquisitions or divestitures could have a material impact on our cash flows.

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion in 2009, $1.3
billion in 2008 and $8.4 billion in 2007. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2009 primarily related to a $99 million payment made to Groupe Danone S.A. in 2008 to refund excess cash received in the acquisition of

LU

Biscuit and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by lower proceeds from divestitures. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2008 primarily related to lower payments for acquisitions, partially offset by lower proceeds from
divestitures and higher capital expenditures.

During 2009, we divested our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S., a juice operation in Brazil and a
plant in Spain and received $41 million in net proceeds. During 2008, we received $153 million in net proceeds on divestitures, primarily related to a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and four operations in Spain, and we disbursed $56 million for
transaction fees related to the split-off of the

Post

cereals business. Additionally, we paid Groupe Danone S.A. the aforementioned refund in 2008. During 2007, we received net proceeds of $216 million from the divestitures of our flavored
water and juice brand assets and related trademarks, our sugar confectionery assets in Romania and related trademarks and our hot cereal assets and trademarks. Additionally, we acquired

LU

Biscuit for

€

5.1 billion (approximately $7.6 billion) in cash in 2007.

Capital
expenditures, which were funded by operating activities, were $1.3 billion in 2009, $1.4 billion in 2008 and $1.2 billion in 2007. The 2009 capital expenditures were primarily used to modernize manufacturing facilities and


support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2010 capital expenditures to be in line with 2009 expenditures, including capital expenditures required for systems’ investments.
We expect to fund these expenditures from operations. As this disclosure was made as of December 31, 2009, it does not reflect the impacts of our recent acquisition and divestiture activity.

Net Cash (Used in) / Provided by Financing Activities:

Net
cash used in financing activities was $3.1 billion in 2009 and $2.1 billion during 2008, compared with $5.1 billion provided during 2007. The net cash used in financing activities in 2009 primarily related to $1.7 billion in dividend payments, $950
million in repayments of long-term debt securities and $344 million in net commercial paper repayments. Additionally, other cash used in financing activities in 2009 included $69 million in costs related to our bridge facility agreement dated
November 9, 2009 (the “Cadbury Bridge Facility”). The net cash used in financing activities in 2008 primarily related to $5.9 billion in payments made on the bridge facility used to fund our

LU

Biscuit acquisition, $1.7 billion
in dividend payments, $777 million in Common Stock share repurchases and $795 million in repayments of long-term debt securities, primarily related to debt that matured on October 1, 2008, partially offset by $6.9 billion in proceeds from our
long-term debt offerings. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 was primarily due to $6.4 billion in proceeds from long-term debt offerings and net outstanding borrowings of $5.5 billion under the bridge facility used to fund our

LU

Biscuit acquisition, partially offset by $3.7 billion in Common Stock share repurchases, $1.6 billion in dividend payments and $1.4 billion in repayments of long-term debt securities that matured.

In August 2010, $500 million of our long-term debt matures. We expect to fund the repayment with cash from operations or short-term borrowings. As this disclosure was
made as of December 31, 2009, it does not reflect the impacts of our recent acquisition and divestiture activity.

Borrowing Arrangements:

On November 30, 2009, we entered into a revolving credit agreement for a $4.5 billion three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The
agreement replaced our former revolving credit agreement, which was terminated upon the signing of the new agreement. We intend to use the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, including for working capital purposes, and to
support our commercial paper issuances. No amounts have been drawn on the facility.

The revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum
total shareholders’ equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses), of at least $23.0 billion. Upon the completion of the Cadbury acquisition this covenant will increase by 75% of any increase in our total
shareholders’ equity as a direct result of a) our issuance of certain types of equity securities to finance the acquisition; or b) our refinancing certain indebtedness. At December 31, 2009, our total shareholders’ equity, excluding
accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses), was $29.8 billion. We expect to continue to meet this covenant. The revolving credit agreement also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. However, the revolving
credit facility has no other financial covenants, credit rating triggers or provisions that could require us to post collateral as security.

In
addition to the above, some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet short-term working capital needs. Collectively, these credit lines amounted to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2009. Borrowings
on these lines amounted to $191 million at December 31, 2009 and $291 million at December 31, 2008.

The Cadbury Bridge Facility is a
£5.5 billion (approximately $8.9 billion) 364-day senior unsecured facility. On January 18, 2010, we amended the agreement to increase the Cadbury Bridge Facility to an aggregate of £7.1 billion. On February 11, 2010,
after the issuance of $9.5 billion of senior unsecured notes, we amended the agreement again to decrease the Cadbury Bridge Facility to an aggregate of £1.3 billion. We expect to use borrowings under the Cadbury Bridge Facility and
proceeds from other financing sources to finance the Cadbury acquisition and to refinance certain indebtedness of Cadbury and its subsidiaries. With certain restrictions, borrowings under the Cadbury Bridge Facility are also available for our
general corporate purposes.

The Cadbury Bridge Facility agreement includes the same minimum shareholders’ equity requirement as in our $4.5
billion revolving credit agreement. In addition, in the event that our long-term senior unsecured indebtedness is rated below investment grade by either Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, the Cadbury Bridge Facility agreement requires
us to maintain a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.25 to 1.00. At December 31, 2009, we continued


to maintain our investment grade debt rating, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.64. The Cadbury Bridge Facility agreement also contains customary representations, covenants and
events of default and requires the prepayment of advances and / or the permanent reduction of commitments under the facility with the net cash proceeds received from certain disposals, debt issuances and equity capital markets transactions. No
amounts were drawn on the facility at December 31, 2009.

Subject to market conditions, we expect to refinance or reduce advances under the Cadbury
Bridge Facility from proceeds of alternative financing sources.

Debt:

Our total debt was $19.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and $20.3 billion at December 31, 2008. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.42 at December 31, 2009 and 0.48 at December 31, 2008. At
December 31, 2009, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 8.4 years.

On February 8, 2010, we issued $9.5 billion of
senior unsecured notes at a weighted-average effective rate of 5.364% and are using the net proceeds ($9,379 million) to finance the Cadbury acquisition and for general corporate purposes. After the issuance of the $9.5 billion of senior unsecured
notes, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 10.5 years.

On September 3, 2009, we redeemed our November 2011, 7% $200
million debenture at par value. Upon redemption, we recorded a loss of $14 million within interest and other expense, net which represented the write-off of the remaining discount. On November 12, 2009, we repaid $750 million in
notes, and on October 1, 2008, we repaid $700 million in notes. These repayments were primarily financed from commercial paper issuances.

On
December 19, 2008, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes; on May 22, 2008, we issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes; and on March 20, 2008, we issued

€

2.85 billion (approximately $4.5 billion) of senior unsecured notes. We used the net proceeds from these issuances ($498 million in December, $1,967 million in May and
approximately $4,470 million in March) for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under the bridge facility used to fund our

LU

Biscuit acquisition and other short-term borrowings.

The notes from all above issuances include covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt secured by liens above a certain threshold. We are also required to offer
to purchase these notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, if we experience both of the following:

(i)

a “change of control” triggering event, and

(ii)

a downgrade of these notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch within a specified period.

We expect to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to Note 7,

Debt and Borrowing Arrangements

, for further
details of these debt offerings.

From time to time we refinance long-term and short-term debt. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term
debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. We have an automatic shelf registration on Form S-3 on file with the SEC. As a well-known seasoned issuer, we are
able to register new debt securities in amounts authorized by our Board of Directors through December 2010. On October 4, 2007 our Board of Directors authorized $5.0 billion in general long-term financing, which was in addition to the

€

5.3 billion authorized for the

LU

Biscuit acquisition and the £7.1 billion authorized for the Cadbury acquisition. At
December 31, 2009, we had approximately $3.0 billion remaining in general long-term financing authority and £7.1 billion (approximately $11.5 billion) remaining in Cadbury financing authority from our Board of Directors.


Debt Ratings:

At February 16, 2010, our debt ratings by major credit rating agencies were:


(3)

Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our capital leases, including the expected cash payments of interest expense of approximately $18 million on our capital leases.

(4)

Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.

(5)

Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and
distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services.
Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable
without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.

(6)

Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2019 of approximately $2,180
million. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2019; as such, they are excluded from the above table. In addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the
table above: accrued pension costs, income taxes, insurance accruals and other accruals. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments (or contributions beyond 2010, in the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. We currently
expect to make approximately $240 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2010. We also expect that our net pension cost will increase by approximately $50 million to approximately $440 million in 2010. As of December 31, 2009, our
total liability for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions and associated accrued interest and penalties, was $1.2 billion. We expect to pay approximately $239 million in the next 12 months. During 2009, we reached an agreement with the IRS
on specific matters related to years 2000 through 2003. Our returns for those years are still under examination, and the IRS recently began its examination of years 2004 through 2006. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future
cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of these and other tax audit outcomes.

Equity and Dividends

Stock Repurchases:

Our Board of Directors authorized the following Common Stock repurchase programs. Our $5.0 billion share repurchase authority expired on March 30, 2009. We did
not repurchase any shares in 2009.

In total, we repurchased 25.3 million shares for $777 million in 2008 and 110.1 million shares for $3,640 million
in 2007 under these programs. We made these repurchases of our Common Stock in open market transactions.

In March 2007, we repurchased 1.4 million
additional shares of our Common Stock from Altria at a cost of $46.5 million. We paid $32.085 per share, which was the average of the high and the low price of Kraft Foods Common Stock as reported on the NYSE on March 1, 2007. This repurchase
was in accordance with our spin-off agreement with Altria.

Stock Plans:

At our 2009 annual meeting, our shareholders approved the Kraft Foods Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”). The 2005 Plan includes, among other provisions, a
limit on the number of shares that may be granted, vesting restrictions and a prohibition on stock option repricing. Under the amended plan, we are authorized to issue a maximum of 168.0 million shares of our Common Stock. As of the effective
date of the amendment, there were 92.1 million shares available to be granted under the 2005 Plan, of which no more than 27.5 million shares may be awarded as restricted or deferred stock.

In 2008, we changed our annual and long-term incentive compensation programs to further align them with shareholder returns. Under the annual equity program, we now
grant equity in the form of both restricted or deferred stock and stock options. The restricted or deferred stock continues to vest 100% after three years, and the stock


options vest in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Additionally, we changed our long-term incentive plan from a cash-based program to a share-based
program. These shares vest based on varying performance, market and service conditions. The unvested long-term incentive plan shares have no voting rights and do not pay dividends.

In January 2009, we granted 1.5 million shares of stock in connection with our long-term incentive plan. The market value per share was $27.00 on the date of grant. In February 2009, as part of our annual
equity program, we issued 4.1 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees. The market value per restricted or deferred share was $23.64 on the date of grant. Also, as part of our annual equity program, we granted
16.3 million stock options to eligible employees at an exercise price of $23.64.

We also issued 0.2 million off-cycle shares of restricted
and deferred stock during 2009. The weighted-average market value per restricted or deferred share was $25.55 on the date of grant. In aggregate, we issued 5.8 million restricted and deferred shares during 2009.

At December 31, 2009, the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options, vesting of non-U.S. deferred shares and vesting of long-term
incentive plan shares was 52.8 million or 3.6% of total shares outstanding.

In January 2008, we granted 1.4 million shares of stock in
connection with our long-term incentive plan. The market value per share was $32.26 on the date of grant. In February 2008, as part of our annual equity program, we issued 3.4 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible
employees. The market value per restricted or deferred share was $29.49 on the date of grant. Also, as part of our annual equity program, we granted 13.5 million stock options to eligible employees at an exercise price of $29.49.

In addition, we issued 0.2 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2008. The weighted-average market value per restricted or deferred
share was $30.38 on the date of grant. In aggregate, we issued 5.0 million restricted and deferred shares during 2008. We also granted 0.1 million off-cycle stock options during 2008 at an exercise price of $30.78. In aggregate, we granted
13.6 million stock options during 2008.

Our Board of Directors approved a stock option grant to our Chief Executive Officer on May 3, 2007,
to recognize her election as our Chairman. She received 300,000 stock options, which vest under varying market and service conditions and expire ten years after the grant date.

In January 2007, we issued 5.2 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees as part of our annual equity program. The market value per restricted or deferred share was $34.655 on the
date of grant. Additionally, we issued 1.0 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2007. The weighted-average market value per restricted or deferred share was $34.085 on the date of grant. The total number of
restricted and deferred shares issued in 2007 was 9.2 million, including those issued as a result of our spin-off from Altria (discussed below).

Upon our spin-off, Altria stock awards were modified through the issuance of Kraft Foods stock awards, and accordingly, the Altria stock awards were split into two instruments. Holders of Altria stock options received: 1) a new Kraft Foods
option to acquire shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock; and 2) an adjusted Altria stock option for the same number of shares of Altria common stock previously held, but with a proportionally reduced exercise price. For each employee stock option
outstanding, the aggregate intrinsic value immediately after our spin-off from Altria was not greater than the aggregate intrinsic value immediately prior to it. Holders of Altria restricted stock or stock rights awarded before January 31,
2007, retained their existing awards and received restricted stock or stock rights in Kraft Foods Common Stock. Recipients of Altria restricted stock or stock rights awarded on or after January 31, 2007, did not receive Kraft Foods restricted
stock or stock rights because Altria had announced the spin-off at that time. We reimbursed Altria $179 million for net settlement of the employee stock awards. We determined the fair value of the stock options using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model, and adjusted the fair value of the restricted stock and stock rights by the value of projected forfeitures.

Based upon the number of
Altria stock awards outstanding at the time of our spin-off, we granted stock options for 24.2 million shares of Common Stock at a weighted-average price of $15.75. The options expire between 2007 and


2012. In addition, we issued 3.0 million shares of restricted stock and stock rights. The market value per restricted share or right was $31.66 on the date of grant. Restrictions on the
majority of these restricted shares and stock rights lapsed in either the first quarter of 2008 or 2009.

Dividends:

We paid dividends of $1,712 million in 2009, $1,663 million in 2008 and $1,638 million in 2007. The increases of 2.9% in 2009 and 1.5% in 2008 reflect higher dividend
rates, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding resulting from the split-off of the

Post

cereals business and share repurchases. The present annualized dividend rate is $1.16 per common share. The declaration of dividends is subject to
the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision
making.

2010 Outlook

We expect the
strong operating and financial momentum of our base business to carry forward into coming years. In the near term, we continue to target organic net revenue growth of 4 percent or more and the high end of our 7 to 9 percent long-term EPS growth
objective on our base business.

We expect to deliver this performance while:

•

investing incrementally in product quality, marketing and innovation;

•

raising productivity as a percentage of cost of goods sold to greater than 4 percent by 2011;

•

leveraging overhead costs by reducing overhead as a percentage of net revenue to approximately 12.5 percent by 2011; and

•

restoring operating income margins to industry benchmarks in the mid-teens by 2011.

In addition, our consolidated results will include Cadbury from February 2, 2010, onwards. The combination of Kraft Foods and Cadbury is expected to provide the
potential for meaningful revenue synergies over time from investments in distribution, marketing and product development. As a result, the combined company is targeting long-term organic net revenue growth of 5 percent or more.

Opportunities for significant synergies from the combination have also been identified. On a combined basis, we continue to expect that pre-tax cost savings of at
least $675 million annually can be realized by the end of 2012. Total one-time implementation cash costs of approximately $1.3 billion are expected to be incurred through the end of 2012.

On a combined basis, we are targeting accretion to earnings per share in 2011 of approximately $0.05 on a cash basis, which excludes one-time expenses to achieve cost
savings, expenses related to the transaction and the impact of incremental non-cash items such as the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition. Over the long-term, the combined company is targeting EPS growth of 9 to 11 percent.

Our results will also be affected by the sale of the assets of our Frozen Pizza business, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2010. We
also expect earnings to be reduced by approximately $0.05 per diluted share on an annual basis as a result of the Frozen Pizza business transaction. This assumes the proceeds will be used for a combination of debt reduction and share repurchases.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure “organic net revenues” and corresponding growth ratios. The difference between “organic net revenues” and “net revenues,” which is the most
comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is that organic net revenues excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency. Organic net revenues is used by our management to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our
performance. We have disclosed this measure so that you have the same financial data that management uses with the intention of assisting you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance. Our
management believes that organic net revenues better reflect the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provide improved comparability of results because they exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates, which are not under our control, and also exclude the one-time impacts of acquisitions and divestitures on net revenues. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on net revenues. The best way that this
limitation can be addressed is by using organic net revenues in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported net revenues. Our management believes that the presentation of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP
financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting Kraft Foods than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because
organic net revenues calculations may vary among other companies, the organic net revenues figures presented in the Consolidated Results of Operations section may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net
revenues are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. You should carefully evaluate the following table reconciling U.S. GAAP reported net revenues to organic net revenues.

In addition, we use the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure “free cash flow.” The difference between “free cash flow”
and “net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is that free cash flow reflects the impact of capital expenditures. The limitation of this measure is that it includes items that do
not have an impact on our cash flow provided by operating activities. The best way that this limitation can be addressed is by using free cash flow in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported net cash provided by operating activities.

Free cash flow is an internal, supplemental measure of our performance. Our management uses free cash flow as the primary cash flow metric in the budgeting and
forecasting processes, as it represents the controllable cash flows from operations. We believe free cash flow shows the financial health of, and how efficiently we are running, the company. We further believe that this non-U.S. GAAP measure
provides information useful to both management and investors in gaining an overall understanding of our current financial performance, and that it provides investors with financial information that most closely aligns to our internal measurement
processes.

This non-U.S. GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows generated by operating, investing or
financing activities as a measure of our liquidity. Because free cash flow is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, free cash flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures of other companies.


The table below reconciles reported net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the periods
stated.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

As we operate globally, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks. We monitor and
manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have
on our operating results. We maintain foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate risk management policies that principally use derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility
in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to
leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes. Refer to Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,

and Note 12,

Financial Instruments

, to the consolidated financial statements
for further details of our foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate risk management policies and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge those exposures.

In October 2008, one of our counterparties, Lehman Brothers Commercial Corporation, filed for bankruptcy. Consequently, we wrote off an insignificant asset related to derivatives held with them. This did not have a
significant impact on our foreign currency risk management program.

Value at Risk:

We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax
earnings of our foreign currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. We included our debt; short-term investments; foreign currency forwards, swaps and options; and commodity futures, forwards and options in our VAR
computation. Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the computation.

We made the VAR estimates assuming normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval. We used a “variance / co-variance” model to determine the
observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts
at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying
currency or commodity, and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.


As of December 31, 2009, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive
instruments, primarily debt, under normal market conditions and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our foreign currency and commodity instruments under normal market conditions, as calculated in the VAR model, were
(in millions):

This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse
movements in interest rates, foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by Kraft Foods, nor does it consider the effect of
favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future
changes in market rates may have on our future financial results.

Prior to June 13, 2001, Kraft Foods was a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”). On June 13, 2001, we completed an initial public offering of 280,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock
(“Common Stock”). In the first quarter of 2007, Altria spun off its remaining interest (89.0%) in Kraft Foods on a pro rata basis to Altria stockholders in a tax-free transaction. Effective as of the close of business on
March 30, 2007, all Kraft Foods shares owned by Altria were distributed to Altria’s stockholders, and our separation from Altria was completed.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include Kraft Foods, as well as our wholly owned and majority owned
subsidiaries. Our domestic operating subsidiaries report year-end results as of the last Saturday of the year, and our international operating subsidiaries generally report year-end results two weeks prior to the last Saturday of the year.

We account for investments in which we exercise significant influence (20%-50% ownership interest) under the equity method of accounting. We use the
cost method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20% and in which we do not exercise significant influence. Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries consists of the equity interest of noncontrolling
investors in consolidated subsidiaries of Kraft Foods. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.

Use of Estimates:

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which require
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our financial statements. Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, pension and benefit plan assumptions, lives and valuation
assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, marketing programs and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the
revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

Foreign Currencies:

We translate the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries using average exchange rates during each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of each period. We record currency translation
adjustments as a component of equity. Transaction gains and losses are recorded in earnings and were not significant for any of the periods presented.

Highly Inflationary Accounting:

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Venezuelan economy was classified as highly inflationary under U.S.
GAAP. Effective January 1, 2010, our Venezuelan subsidiary is being accounted for under highly inflationary accounting rules, which principally means all transactions are recorded in U.S. dollars. Venezuela has three exchange rates: the
official rate, the consumer staples rate and the secondary (or parallel) rate. We have historically used and will continue to use the official rate to translate our Venezuelan operations. However, prior to this change in accounting, cash that we had
exchanged into U.S. dollars using the secondary market was carried at that rate. Upon the change to highly inflationary accounting, we were required to translate our U.S. dollars on hand using the official rate. Additionally, on January 8,
2010, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency. Accordingly, we were required to revalue our net assets in Venezuela and we recorded an insignificant loss, which will be reflected in our first quarter 2010 results. This disclosure does not
reflect the impacts of our recent acquisition activity.


Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. We record inventory allowances for
overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes. Effective January 1, 2009, we changed our method of valuing our U.S. inventories to the average cost method. In prior years, principally all U.S. inventories were
valued using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. We believe that the average cost method of accounting for U.S. inventories is preferable and will improve financial reporting by better matching revenues and expenses to current costs,
by better aligning our external reporting with our competitors, and by aligning our external reporting with our tax basis of accounting. The financial statements for all periods presented were conformed to the change in accounting policy. With this
change, we value all of our inventories using the average cost method.

The following line items within the statements of earnings were affected by the
change in accounting policy:


As a result of the accounting change, retained earnings as of January 1, 2007, decreased from $11,128 million, as
computed using the LIFO method, to $11,109 million using the average cost method.

There was no impact to net cash provided by operating activities as a
result of this change in accounting policy.

Long-Lived Assets:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging
from 3 to 20 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 40 years.

We review long-lived assets, including amortizable
intangible assets, for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing assets held
for use for impairment, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets
to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.


Software Costs:

We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment and
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets at least annually for impairment. We have recognized goodwill in our reporting units, which
are generally one level below our operating segments. We use a two step process to test goodwill at the reporting unit level. The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value
is estimated using discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on planned growth rates, and estimates of discount rates and residual values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the second step of the process is necessary. The second
step measures the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. To test non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment, we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. Fair value of
non-amortizable intangible assets is determined using our planned growth rates, and estimates of discount rates and royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value.
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill and
non-amortizable intangible assets as of October 1 each year. The basis of our valuation methodology for estimating the fair value of our 20 reporting units is a 20-year projection of discounted cash flows that is based on our annual strategic
planning process. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic conditions. For our reporting units within our Kraft Foods North America and
Kraft Foods Europe geographic units, we used a market-participant, weighted-average cost of capital of 7.5% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our reporting units within our Kraft Foods Developing Markets geographic unit,
we used a risk-rated discount rate of 10.5%.

Insurance and Self-Insurance:

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and our obligation for employee
healthcare benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions.

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers, which generally occurs upon shipment or
delivery of goods. Revenues are recorded net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers. Kraft Foods’ shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. A
provision for product returns and allowances for bad debts are also recorded as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized.

Excise Taxes:

Effective January 1, 2009, we changed our classification of certain excise taxes to a net presentation within cost of
sales. In prior years, excise taxes were classified gross within net revenues and cost of sales. With this change, we report all of our excise and similar taxes using the net presentation method. We made this change to better align our net revenues
between various countries and to provide better clarity to net revenues and margins. As a result, we removed $269 million in 2008 and $276 million in 2007 from net revenues, and netted the amounts within cost of sales. If we had not made this
change, in 2009, net revenues of $40,386 million would have been $40,621 million, and cost of sales of $25,786 million would have been $26,021 million. This change did not have a material impact on our net revenues or cost of sales.

Marketing, Administration and Research Costs:

Marketing

- - We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. We expense advertising costs
either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a
period. We base these estimates principally on historical


utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated volume and
related expense for the full year. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Advertising expense was $1,648 million in 2009, $1,639 million in 2008 and
$1,471 million in 2007.

Research

- We expense costs as incurred for product research and development. Research and development expense was $477
million in 2009, $498 million in 2008 and $442 million in 2007.

Environmental Costs:

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when
amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when recovery of those costs
is deemed probable. At December 31, 2009, our subsidiaries were involved in 71 active actions in the U.S. under Superfund legislation (and other similar actions) related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for
which we retain liability.

Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation
actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results. However, we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental
remediation actions.

Employee Benefit Plans:

In
September 2006, new guidance was issued surrounding employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The new guidance required us to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date
beginning in 2008. We previously measured our non-U.S. pension plans (other than certain Canadian and French pension plans) at September 30 of each year. On December 31, 2008, we recorded an after-tax decrease of $8 million to retained
earnings using the 15-month approach to proportionally allocate the transition adjustment required upon adoption of the measurement provision of the new guidance. The plan assets and benefit obligations of our pension plans and the benefit
obligations of our postretirement plans are now all measured at year-end.

We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees. These
include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits, consisting primarily of severance. We provide pension coverage for certain employees of our non-U.S. subsidiaries through separate plans. Local statutory
requirements govern many of these plans. For salaried and non-union hourly employees hired in the U.S. after January 1, 2009, we discontinued benefits under our U.S. pension plans, and we replaced them with an enhanced company contribution to
our employee savings plan. Additionally, we will be freezing the U.S. pension plans for current salaried and non-union hourly employees effective December 31, 2019. Pension accruals for all salaried and non-union employees who are currently
earning pension benefits will end on December 31, 2019, and continuing pay and service will be used to calculate the pension benefits through December 31, 2019. Our projected benefit obligation decreased $168 million in 2009, and we
incurred a $5 million curtailment charge in 2009 related to the freeze. Our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries provide health care and other benefits to most retired employees. Local government plans generally cover health care benefits for retirees
outside the U.S. and Canada. Our postemployment benefit plans cover most salaried and certain hourly employees. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees.

Financial Instruments:

As we operate globally, we use certain
financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate risk management
strategies that seek to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates, principally through the use of derivative instruments.


Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the
hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives,
strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be
specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur. If we deem it probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, we recognize the gain or loss in earnings currently.

By using derivatives to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates, we have exposure on these derivatives to credit and market
risk. We are exposed to credit risk that the counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with
investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. In October 2008, one of our counterparties, Lehman Brothers Commercial Corporation, filed
for bankruptcy. Consequently, we wrote off an insignificant asset related to derivatives held with them. This did not have a significant impact on our foreign currency risk management program. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all
significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration greater than one year be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument might
be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments
and derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that may be undertaken by the use of derivative instruments.

We record derivative
financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either current assets or current liabilities. Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements
of cash flows.

Commodity cash flow hedges

- We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we
primarily use as raw materials. Accordingly, we use commodity forward contracts as cash flow hedges, primarily for meat, coffee, dairy, sugar, cocoa and wheat. Commodity forward contracts generally qualify for the normal purchase exception under
guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and therefore are not subject to its provisions. We use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including dairy, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn products,
soybean oils, meat products, sugar, natural gas and heating oil. Some of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we
occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.

For those derivative instruments that are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we defer the effective portion of unrealized gains and losses
on commodity futures and option contracts as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses). We recognize the deferred portion as a component of cost of sales when the related inventory is sold. Ineffectiveness is directly
recorded as a component of cost of sales. For the derivative instruments that we consider economic hedges but do not designate for hedge accounting treatment, we recognize gains and losses directly as a component of cost of sales.

Foreign currency cash flow hedges

- We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and
intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. These instruments include forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge
our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, Swiss franc, British pound and Canadian dollar.

For those derivative instruments that are
highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we defer the effective portion of unrealized gains and losses associated with forward, swap and option contracts as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) until
the underlying hedged transactions are reported in earnings. We recognize the deferred portion as a component of cost of sales when the related inventory is sold or as


interest and other expense, net for our hedges of intercompany loans, when the payments are made. For those derivative instruments that we consider economic hedges but do not designate for hedge
accounting treatment, we recognize gains and losses directly as a component of cost of sales or interest and other expense, net, depending on the nature of the underlying transaction.

Interest rate cash flow and fair value hedges

- We manage interest rate volatility by modifying the repricing or maturity characteristics of certain liabilities so that the net interest margin is not, on a
material basis, adversely affected by movements in interest rates. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation is
expected to be substantially offset by our gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to these hedged liabilities.

We use derivative
instruments, including interest rate swaps that have indices related to the pricing of specific liabilities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. As a matter of policy, we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments for
interest rate risk management. We use interest rate swaps to economically convert a portion of our nonprepayable fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. Under the interest rate swap contracts, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified
intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts, which is calculated based on an agreed-upon notional amount. We also use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our
future debt obligations. Substantially all of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

For those
derivative instruments that are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we either record the impacts in current period earnings or defer the effective portion of unrealized gains and losses as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive earnings / (losses), depending on whether the hedging relationship satisfies the criteria for a fair value or cash flow hedge. For fair value hedges, we record both (i) the gains or losses on interest rate swaps and (ii) the
corresponding changes in fair value of the hedged long-term debt directly as a component of interest and other expense, net. For cash flow hedges, we recognize the deferred portion as a component of interest and other expense, net when we incur the
interest expense. The ineffective portion is directly recorded as a component of interest and other expense, net. For the derivative instruments that we consider economic hedges but do not designate for hedge accounting treatment, we recognize gains
and losses directly as a component of interest and other expense, net.

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations

- We have numerous
investments in foreign subsidiaries. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We use foreign-currency-denominated debt to hedge our net investment in foreign operations against adverse
movements in exchange rates. We designated our euro denominated borrowings as a net investment hedge of a portion of our overall European operations. The gains and losses on our net investment in these designated European operations are economically
offset by losses and gains on our euro denominated borrowings. The change in the debt’s fair value is recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses).

Guarantees:

Authoritative guidance related to guarantor’s
accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees requires us to disclose certain guarantees and to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 13,

Commitments and
Contingencies

for a further discussion of guarantees.

Income Taxes:

Prior to our spin-off from Altria, we were included in Altria’s consolidated federal income tax return. We generally computed income taxes on a separate company basis; however, some of our foreign tax credits,
capital losses and other credits could not be used on a separate company basis. To the extent that Altria used our foreign tax credits and other tax benefits in its consolidated federal income tax return, we recognized the benefit in the calculation
of our provision for income taxes. This benefit was approximately $270 million in 2007. We made payments to, or were reimbursed by, Altria for the tax effects resulting from being included in Altria’s tax return. As of March 31, 2007, we
were no longer a member of the Altria consolidated tax return group. We file our own federal consolidated income tax returns. As a result of the spin-off, Altria transferred our federal tax contingencies to our balance sheet and related interest
income of $77 million in 2007. Additionally, during 2007, Altria paid us $305 million for the federal tax contingencies held by them, less the impact of federal reserves reversed due to the adoption of new guidance, discussed below, which addressed
accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes. This amount was reflected as a


component of the change in other current assets within the net cash provided by operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows.

In July 2006, new guidance was issued which addressed accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes

.

We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2007.
The guidance clarified when tax benefits should be recorded in the financial statements and provided measurement criteria for valuing such benefits. In order for us to recognize benefits, our tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained
upon audit. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Before the implementation of the guidance, we established additional provisions
for certain positions that were likely to be challenged even though we believe that those existing tax positions were fully supportable. The adoption of this guidance resulted in an increase to equity as of January 1, 2007 of
$213 million.

We recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Reclassification:

In 2009, we separately disclosed other non-cash expense, net within the net cash provided by
operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows and made conforming changes to the presentation in prior years. This change did not have an impact on cash provided by operating activities for any of the periods presented. In
2009, we also changed our cost assignment methodology for headquarter functional costs across our operating structure. As a result, we reclassified $188 million in 2008 and $83 million in 2007 from marketing, administration and research costs to
cost of sales. This change did not have an impact on net earnings for any of the periods presented.

New Accounting Pronouncements:

In September 2006, new guidance was issued on fair value measurements. The guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The effective date of the guidance for items recognized or disclosed at fair value on an annual or more frequently recurring basis was January 1, 2008. The effective date of the guidance for all other
nonfinancial assets and liabilities was January 1, 2009. As such, we partially adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2008. The partial adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements. We adopted the
remaining provisions effective January 1, 2009. This adoption affects the way that we calculate fair value for our annual impairment review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, and when conditions exist that require us to
calculate the fair value of long-lived assets; however, this adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

In December 2007, new
guidance was issued on business combinations. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2009. The guidance requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction;
establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose all information needed by investors to understand the nature and financial effect of the
business combination. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

In December 2007, new guidance was also
issued on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2009. The guidance requires us to classify noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries as a separate component of equity instead
of within other liabilities. Additionally, transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests must be treated as equity transactions. Therefore, they no longer are removed from net income, but rather are accounted for as equity. The
adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

In June 2008, new guidance was issued to assist in determining
whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2009. The guidance considers unvested share-based payment awards with the right to receive nonforfeitable
dividends, or their equivalents, participating securities that should be included in the calculation of EPS under the two-class method. Accordingly, our restricted and deferred stock awards are now considered participating units in our calculation
of EPS. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.


In May 2009, new guidance was issued on subsequent events that requires management to evaluate subsequent events
through the date the financial statements are either issued or available to be issued, depending on the company’s expectation of whether it will widely distribute its financial statements to its shareholders and other financial statement users.
Companies are required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. We adopted the guidance effective June 30, 2009.

In June 2009, new guidance was issued on the consolidation of variable interest entities. The provisions are effective for Kraft Foods as of January 1, 2010. This guidance improves the financial reporting by enterprises involved with
variable interest entities. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements.

Note 2.  Acquisitions and Divestitures:

Cadbury Acquisition:

On January 19, 2010, we announced the terms of our final offer for each outstanding ordinary share of Cadbury plc (“Cadbury”), including each ordinary
share represented by an American Depositary Share (“Cadbury ADS”), and the Cadbury board of directors recommended that Cadbury shareholders accept the terms of the final offer. Under the terms of the offer, we agreed to pay Cadbury
shareholders 500 pence in cash and 0.1874 shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock per Cadbury ordinary share validly tendered and 2,000 pence in cash and 0.7496 shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock per Cadbury ADS validly tendered. This valued each Cadbury
ordinary share at 840 pence and each Cadbury ADS at £33.60 (based on the closing price of $29.58 for a share of Kraft Foods Common Stock on January 15, 2010 and an exchange rate of $1.63 per £1.00) and valued the entire issued share
capital of Cadbury at £11.9 billion (approximately $19.4 billion) on January 15, 2010, the last trading day before the publication of our final offer. The combination of Kraft Foods and Cadbury will create a global powerhouse in snacks,
confectionery and quick meals with a rich portfolio of iconic brands.

On February 2, 2010, all of the conditions to the offer were satisfied or
validly waived, the initial offer period expired and a subsequent offer period immediately began. At that point, we had received acceptances of 71.73% of the outstanding Cadbury ordinary shares, including those represented by Cadbury ADSs.
The subsequent offer period remains open until further notice and at least 14 days of notice will be given if Kraft Foods decides to close the offer. As of February 15, 2010, we had received acceptances of 1,262,356,520 shares representing
91.02% of the outstanding Cadbury ordinary shares, including those represented by Cadbury ADSs. As we have received acceptances of over 90% of Cadbury shares, we are n the process of acquiring the remaining Cadbury ordinary shares that are not
tendered in the offer, including those represented by Cadbury ADSs, through a compulsory acquisition procedure under the United Kingdom Companies Act of 2006, as amended. Additionally, as a condition of the EU Commission’s approval of the
Cadbury acquisition, we are required to divest confectionary operations in Poland and Romania. As part of our acquisition of Cadbury, we expensed approximately $40 million in transaction related fees in 2009 as we incurred them, and we also incurred
$40 million in financing fees in 2009 related to the acquisition.

The accounting for our Cadbury acquisition was incomplete at the time we issued our
financial statements. Accordingly, it is impracticable for us to make certain business combination disclosures. At the time of filing, it was impracticable for us to: A) Complete a reconciliation of Cadbury’s IFRS financial statements to
U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, we were unable to present the acquisition date fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, or assets and liabilities arising from contingencies. B) Calculate the amount of goodwill and intangibles acquired and
the total amount of goodwill that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. C) Provide proforma segment disclosures. And D) present supplemental proforma combined information on a U.S. GAAP basis for the most recent period presented.

Pizza Divestiture:

On January 4, 2010, we
entered into an agreement to sell the assets of our North American frozen pizza business (“Frozen Pizza”) to Nestlé USA, Inc. (“Nestlé”) for total consideration of $3.7 billion. Our Frozen Pizza business is a
component of our U.S. Convenient Meals and Canada & North America Foodservice segments. The sale, which is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory clearances, includes the

DiGiorno

,

Tombstone

and

Jack’s

brands in the U.S., the

Delissio

brand in Canada and the

California Pizza Kitchen

trademark license. It also includes


two Wisconsin manufacturing facilities (Medford and Little Chute) and the leases for the pizza depots and delivery trucks. It is estimated that approximately 3,400 of our employees will transfer
with the business to Nestlé. We anticipate that the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2010.

At December 31, 2009, the Frozen
Pizza business did not meet the criteria to be considered held-for-sale. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, the results of the Frozen Pizza business will be presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements and
prior periods will be restated in a consistent manner. The following reflects the summary results for the Frozen Pizza business that will be treated as a discontinued operation going forward:


LU Biscuit Acquisition:

On November 30, 2007, we acquired the Groupe Danone S.A. global

LU

biscuit business (“

LU

Biscuit”) for

€

5.1 billion (approximately $7.6 billion) in cash. The acquisition included 32 manufacturing facilities and approximately 14,000 employees. During 2008, we repaid Groupe Danone S.A. for excess cash received upon the acquisition.

LU

Biscuit reports results from operations on a one month lag; accordingly, there was no effect on our 2007 operating results. On a proforma basis,

LU

Biscuit would have contributed net revenues of $2.8 billion during 2007, and

LU

Biscuit’s contribution to net earnings would have been insignificant to Kraft Foods.

Other Divestitures:

In 2009, we received $41 million in net proceeds and recorded pre-tax losses of $6 million on the divestitures of our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S., a
juice operation in Brazil and a plant in Spain. We recorded after-tax gains of $58 million on these divestitures, primarily due to the differing book and tax bases of our

Balance

bar operations.

In 2008, we received $153 million in net proceeds, and recorded pre-tax losses of $92 million on divestitures, primarily related to a Nordic and Baltic snacks
operation and four operations in Spain. We recorded after-tax losses of $64 million on these divestitures.

Included in the 2008 divestitures were the
following, which were a condition of the EU Commission’s approval of our

LU

Biscuit acquisition:

•

We divested a biscuit operation in Spain. From this divestiture, we received $86 million in net proceeds and recorded pre-tax losses of $74 million.

•

We divested another biscuit operation in Spain and a trademark in Hungary that we had previously acquired as part of the

LU

Biscuit acquisition. As such,
the impacts of these divestitures were reflected as adjustments to the purchase price allocations.

In 2007, we received $216 million
in net proceeds and recorded pre-tax gains of $14 million on the divestitures of our hot cereal assets and trademarks, our sugar confectionery assets in Romania and related trademarks and our flavored water and juice brand assets and related
trademarks, including

Veryfine

and

Fruit2O

. We recorded an after-tax loss of $5 million on these divestitures to reflect the differing book and tax bases of our hot cereal assets and trademarks divestiture.

These gains and losses on divestitures do not reflect the related asset impairment charges discussed in Note 5,

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

.

The aggregate operating results of the divestitures discussed above, other than the divestiture of the

Post

cereals business, were not material
to our financial statements in any of the periods presented. Refer to Note 16,

Segment Reporting

, for details of the gains and losses on divestitures by segment.


Note 3.  Inventories:

Inventories at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were:


Intangible assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were:

Changes to goodwill and intangible assets during 2009 were:

•

Divestitures - We reduced goodwill by $17 million due to the divestiture of our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S.

•

Asset impairments - During our 2009 review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $12 million charge for the impairment of intangible
assets in the Netherlands.

Changes to goodwill and intangible assets during 2008 were:

•

Acquisitions - We decreased goodwill by $1,187 million and increased intangible assets by $1,356 million primarily due to refinements of preliminary allocations
of the purchase price for our acquisition of

LU

Biscuit. The allocations were based upon appraisals that were finalized in the third quarter of 2008.

•

Divestitures - We reduced goodwill by $1,234 million due to the split-off of our

Post

cereals business, and we reduced goodwill by $38 million and
intangible assets by $37 million due to the divestiture of an operation in Spain.

•

Asset impairments - We recorded asset impairment charges of $34 million to goodwill and $1 million to intangible assets in connection with the divestiture of a
Nordic and Baltic snacks operation. We also recorded asset impairment charges of $1 million to goodwill and $8 million to intangible assets in connection with the anticipated divestiture of a juice operation in Brazil. In addition, during our 2008
review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $44 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands, France and Puerto Rico.

•

Other - We reduced goodwill by $56 million primarily related to a reconciliation of our inventory of deferred tax items that also resulted in a write-down of our
net deferred tax liabilities.

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $26 million in 2009, $23 million in 2008 and
$13 million in 2007. We currently estimate amortization expense for each of the next five years to be approximately $15 million or less.


Annual Impairment Review & Asset Impairment Charges:

As a result of our 2009 annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $12 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in
the Netherlands.

In addition, during 2009, we recorded a $9 million asset impairment charge to write off an investment in Norway. We recorded the aggregate charges within asset impairment and exit costs.

During our 2009 impairment review,
we also noted that the following three reporting units were the most sensitive to near-term changes in our discounted cash flow assumptions:

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed the annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and
recorded a $44 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands, France and Puerto Rico.

During our 2008 impairment review, we determined that our Europe Biscuits reporting unit was the most sensitive to near-term
changes in our discounted cash flow assumptions, as it contains a significant portion of the goodwill recorded upon our 2007 acquisition of

LU

Biscuit. In addition, in December 2008, we reached a preliminary agreement to divest a juice
operation in Brazil and reached an agreement to sell a cheese plant in Australia. In anticipation of divesting the juice operation in Brazil, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The charge primarily
included the write-off of associated intangible assets of $8 million and property, plant and equipment of $4 million. In anticipation of selling the cheese plant in Australia, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $28 million to property, plant
and equipment in the fourth quarter of 2008. Additionally, in 2008, we divested a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and incurred an asset impairment charge of $55 million in connection with the divestiture. This charge primarily included the
write-off of associated goodwill of $34 million and property, plant and equipment of $16 million. We recorded the aggregate charges within asset impairment and exit costs.

In 2007, we divested our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks. In recognition of the divestiture, we recorded a $120 million asset impairment charge for these assets. The charge primarily
included the write-off of associated intangible assets of $70 million and property, plant and equipment of $47 million and was recorded within asset impairment and exit costs.

Note 6.  Restructuring Costs:

Cost Savings Initiatives

We incurred costs associated with our Cost Savings Initiatives of $318 million in 2009. These charges were recorded in operations, primarily within the segment
operating income of Kraft Foods Europe with the remainder spread across all other segments. The Kraft Foods Europe charges were largely a result of the reorganization of our European operations discussed below. Cost Savings Initiatives include exit,
disposal and implementation costs. Even though implementation costs were directly attributable to exit and disposal costs, they did not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. In 2009, our Cost Savings Initiatives
primarily included severance charges for benefits received by terminated employees, associated benefit plan costs and other related activities.

2004-2008 Restructuring Program

In 2008, we completed our five-year restructuring program (the “Restructuring Program”). The
Restructuring Program’s objectives were to leverage our global scale, realign and lower our cost structure, and optimize capacity. As part of the Restructuring Program, we:

•

incurred $3.0 billion in pre-tax charges reflecting asset disposals, severance and implementation costs;

•

announced the closure of 35 facilities and announced the elimination of approximately 18,600 positions; and

•

will use cash to pay for $2.0 billion of the $3.0 billion in charges.


In 2009, we reversed $85 million of previously accrued Restructuring Program charges. Those reversals related to the
following:

•

We sold a plant in Spain that we previously announced we would close under our Restructuring Program. Accordingly, we reversed $35 million in Restructuring
Program charges, primarily related to severance, and recorded a $17 million loss on the divestiture of the plant in 2009. The reversal occurred in our Kraft Foods Europe segment.

•

We also reversed $50 million in Restructuring Program charges, primarily due to planned position eliminations that did not occur. These were primarily the result
of redeployment and natural attrition. The majority of these reversals occurred in our Kraft Foods Europe segment, with the remainder spread across all other segments.

We incurred charges under the Restructuring Program of $989 million in 2008 and $459 million in 2007. Since the inception of the Restructuring Program, we have paid cash of $1.7 billion of the $2.0 billion in
expected cash payments, including $176 million paid in 2009. At December 31, 2009, we had an accrual of $270 million, and we had eliminated approximately 17,300 positions under the Restructuring Program.

In 2008, we implemented a new operating structure built on three core elements: business units, shared services that leverage the scale of our global portfolio, and a
streamlined corporate staff. Within the new structure, business units now have full P&L accountability and are staffed accordingly. This also ensures that we are putting our resources closer to where we make decisions that affect our consumers
and customers. Our corporate and shared service functions streamlined their organizations to focus on core activities that can more efficiently support the goals of the business units. The intent was to simplify, streamline and increase
accountability, with the ultimate goal of generating reliable growth for Kraft Foods. In total, we eliminated approximately 1,400 positions as we streamlined our headquarter functions.

The reorganization of our European operations to function on a pan-European centralized category management and value chain model was completed in 2009 for our Chocolate, Coffee and Cheese categories. Significant
progress was made in 2009 related to the integration of our Europe Biscuits business, and we expect the integration to be completed by mid-2010. The European Principal Company (“EPC”) will manage the European categories centrally and make
decisions for all aspects of the value chain, except for sales and distribution. The European subsidiaries will execute sales and distribution locally, and the local production companies will act as toll manufacturers on behalf of the EPC. The EPC
legal entity has been incorporated as Kraft Foods Europe GmbH in Zurich, Switzerland. As part of the reorganization, we incurred $32 million of severance costs, $25 million of implementation costs and $56 million of other non-recurring costs during
2009; we incurred $16 million of restructuring costs, $39 million of implementation costs and $11 million of other non-recurring costs during 2008; and we incurred $21 million of restructuring costs, $24 million of implementation costs and $10
million of other non-recurring costs during 2007. Through 2009, we have incurred aggregate charges of $241 million related to our Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization, and we expect to incur approximately $40 million in additional charges in 2010 to
complete the integration of the Europe Biscuits business. In 2009, these charges were recorded within cost of sales and marketing, administration and research costs. The 2008 and 2007 restructuring and implementation costs were included in the total
Restructuring Program charges. Other non-recurring costs relating to our Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization were recorded as marketing, administration and research costs. Management believes the disclosure of implementation and other non-recurring
charges provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization.


Restructuring Costs:

Under the Restructuring Program, we recorded asset impairment and exit costs of $884 million during 2008 and $332 million during 2007. Restructuring liability activity for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was:


Total Restructuring Program Costs:

We included the asset impairment, exit and implementation costs discussed above, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 in segment operating income as follows:

The fair values of our short-term borrowings at December 31, 2009 and 2008, based upon current market interest rates,
approximate the amounts disclosed above.

Borrowing Arrangements:

On November 30, 2009, we entered into a revolving credit agreement for a $4.5 billion three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The agreement replaced our former revolving credit agreement, which
was terminated upon


the signing of the new agreement. We intend to use the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, including for working capital purposes, and to support our commercial paper
issuances. No amounts have been drawn on the facility.

The revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum total shareholders’
equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses), of at least $23.0 billion. Upon the completion of our acquisition of Cadbury, this covenant will increase by 75% of any increase in our total shareholders’ equity as a
direct result of a) our issuance of certain types of equity securities to finance the acquisition; or b) our refinancing certain indebtedness. At December 31, 2009, our total shareholders’ equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive
earnings / (losses), was $29.8 billion. We expect to continue to meet this covenant. The revolving credit agreement also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. However, the revolving credit facility has no other
financial covenants, credit rating triggers or provisions that could require us to post collateral as security.

In addition to the above, some of our
international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet short-term working capital needs. Collectively, these credit lines amounted to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2009. Borrowings on these lines amounted to $191
million at December 31, 2009 and $291 million at December 31, 2008.

On November 9, 2009, we entered into an agreement for a
£5.5 billion (approximately $8.9 billion) 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility (the “Cadbury Bridge Facility”). On January 18, 2010, we amended the agreement to increase the Cadbury Bridge Facility to an aggregate of
£7.1 billion. On February 11, 2010, after the issuance of $9.5 billion of senior unsecured notes, we amended the agreement again to decrease the Cadbury Bridge Facility to an aggregate of £1.3 billion. We expect to use
borrowings under the Cadbury Bridge Facility and proceeds from other financing sources to finance the Cadbury acquisition and to refinance certain indebtedness of Cadbury and its subsidiaries. With certain restrictions, borrowings under the Cadbury
Bridge Facility are also available for our general corporate purposes.

The Cadbury Bridge Facility agreement includes the same minimum
shareholders’ equity requirement as in our $4.5 billion revolving credit agreement. In addition, in the event that our long-term senior unsecured indebtedness is rated below investment grade by either Moody’s or Standard &
Poor’s, the Cadbury Bridge Facility agreement requires us to maintain a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of not more than 4.25 to 1.00. At December 31, 2009, we continued to maintain our investment grade debt rating, and our net debt to
adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.64. The Cadbury Bridge Facility agreement also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default and requires the prepayment of advances and / or the permanent reduction of commitments under the facility
with the net cash proceeds received from certain disposals, debt issuances and equity capital markets transactions. No amounts were drawn on the facility at December 31, 2009.

Subject to market conditions, we expect to refinance or reduce advances under the

Cadbury B

ridge Facility from proceeds of alternative financing sources.

Long-Term Debt:

On February 8, 2010, we issued $9.5
billion of senior unsecured notes at a weighted-average effective rate of 5.364% and are using the net proceeds ($9,379 million) to finance the Cadbury acquisition and for general corporate purposes. The general terms of the $9.5 billion notes are:

•

$3.75 billion total principal notes due February 10, 2020 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 5.375%. Interest is payable semiannually beginning
August 10, 2010.

•

$3.00 billion total principal notes due February 9, 2040 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 6.500%. Interest is payable semiannually beginning
August 9, 2010.

•

$1.75 billion total principal notes due February 9, 2016 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 4.125%. Interest is payable semiannually beginning
August 9, 2010.

•

$1.00 billion total principal notes due May 8, 2013 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 2.625%. Interest is payable semiannually beginning November 8,
2010.

On December 19, 2008, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds ($498 million) for
general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. The general terms of the $500 million notes are: $500 million total principal notes due February 19, 2014 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 6.750%. Interest
is payable semiannually, and began on February 19, 2009.


On May 22, 2008, we issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds ($1,967 million) for
general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under the 364-day bridge facility agreement we used to acquire

LU

Biscuit and other short-term borrowings. The general terms of the $2.0 billion notes are:

•

$1,250 million total principal notes due August 23, 2018 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 6.125%. Interest is payable semiannually, and began
February 23, 2009.

•

$750 million total principal notes due January 26, 2039 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 6.875%. Interest is payable semiannually, and began on
January 26, 2009.

On March 20, 2008, we issued

€

2.85 billion (approximately $4.5 billion) of senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds (approximately $4,470 million) to repay a portion of the 364-day bridge facility agreement we used to acquire

LU

Biscuit. The general terms of the

€

2.85 billion notes are:

•

€

2.0 billion (approximately $3.2 billion) total
principal notes due March 20, 2012 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 5.750%. Interest is payable annually, and began March 20, 2009.

•

€

850 million (approximately $1.3 billion)
total principal notes due March 20, 2015 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 6.250%. Interest is payable annually, and began March 20, 2009.

The notes from the above issuances include covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt secured by liens above a certain threshold. We are also required to offer to purchase these notes at a price equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, if we experience both of the following:

(i)

a “change of control” triggering event, and

(ii)

a downgrade of these notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch within a specified period.

We expect to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our long-term debt consisted of (interest rates were as of December 31, 2009):

On September 3, 2009, we redeemed our November 2011, 7% $200 million debenture at par value. Upon redemption, we
recorded a loss of $14 million within interest and other expense, net which represented the write-off of the remaining discount. On November 12, 2009, we repaid $750 million in notes, and on October 1, 2008, we repaid $700 million in
notes. These repayments were primarily financed from commercial paper issuances.


Fair Value:

The aggregate fair value of our long-term debt, based on quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities, was $19,769 million at December 31, 2009 and $19,629 million at December 31, 2008.

The aggregate fair value of our third-party debt, based on market quotes, at December 31, 2009, was $20,222 million as compared with the carrying value of
$18,990 million. The aggregate fair value of our third-party debt at December 31, 2008, was $20,526 million as compared with the carrying value of $20,251 million.

Interest and Other Expense:

Interest and other expense was:

Effective on the date of our spin-off, Altria converted all of its Class B shares of Kraft Foods common stock into Class A
shares of Kraft Foods common stock. Following our spin-off, we only have Class A common stock outstanding. There were no Class B common shares or preferred shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

On August 4, 2008, we completed the split-off of the

Post

cereals business. In this transaction, approximately 46.1 million shares of Kraft Foods
Common Stock were tendered for $1,644 million.

At December 31, 2009, 146,863,809 shares of Common Stock were reserved for stock options and other
stock awards.

In 2010, we expect to issue approximately 260 million additional shares of our Common Stock as part of the Cadbury acquisition.


Our Board of Directors authorized the following Common Stock repurchase programs. Our $5.0 billion share repurchase
authority expired on March 30, 2009. We did not repurchase any shares in 2009.

In total, we repurchased
25.3 million shares for $777 million in 2008 and 110.1 million shares for $3,640 million in 2007 under these programs. We made these repurchases of our Common Stock in open market transactions.

In March 2007, we repurchased 1.4 million additional shares of our Common Stock from Altria at a cost of $46.5 million. We paid $32.085 per share, which was the
average of the high and the low price of Kraft Foods Common Stock as reported on the NYSE on March 1, 2007. This repurchase was in accordance with our Altria spin-off agreement.


Note 9.  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Earnings / (Losses):

The components of accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) were:

Note 10.  Stock Plans:

At our 2009 annual meeting, our shareholders approved the Kraft Foods Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan"). The 2005 Plan includes, among other provisions, a limit on the
number of shares that may be granted under the plan, vesting restrictions and a prohibition on stock option repricing. Under the 2005 Plan, we may grant to eligible employees awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
restricted and deferred stock units, and other awards based on our Common Stock, as well as performance-based annual and long-term incentive awards. We are authorized to issue a maximum of 168.0 million shares of our Common Stock under the 2005
Plan. As of the effective date of the amendment, there were 92.1 million shares available to be granted under the 2005 Plan, of which no more than 27.5 million shares may be awarded as restricted or deferred stock. In addition, under the
Kraft Foods 2006 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “2006 Directors Plan”), we may grant up to 500,000 shares of Common Stock to members of the Board of Directors who are not our full-time employees. At
December 31, 2009, there were


93,740,465 shares available to be granted under the 2005 Plan and 372,097 shares available to be granted under the 2006 Directors Plan. Restricted or deferred shares available for grant under the
2005 Plan at December 31, 2009, were 27,984,072.

In 2008, we changed our annual and long-term incentive compensation programs to further align
them with shareholder returns. Under the annual equity program, we now grant equity in the form of both restricted or deferred stock and stock options. The restricted or deferred stock continues to vest 100% after three years, and the stock options
vest in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Additionally, we changed our long-term incentive plan from a cash-based program to a share-based program. These shares vest based on varying performance, market
and service conditions.

All stock awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. We have no specific policy to repurchase Common Stock to mitigate
the dilutive impact of options; however, we have historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends and other factors, to satisfy stock option exercise activity.

Stock Options:

Stock options are granted at an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the grant date, generally become exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a maximum term of ten years. Prior to 2008, we had not
granted stock options through a broad-based program since 2002.

We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting
using a modified Black-Scholes methodology to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. The fair value of the stock options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period. We recorded compensation expense related to
stock options of $31 million in 2009 and $18 million in 2008. The deferred tax benefit recorded related to this compensation expense was $11 million in 2009 and $6 million in 2008. The unamortized compensation expense related to our stock options
was $48 million at December 31, 2009 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions were as follows:

In February 2009, as part of our annual equity program, we granted 16.3 million stock options to eligible employees at
an exercise price of $23.64.


In February 2008, as part of our annual equity program, we granted 13.5 million stock options to eligible
employees at an exercise price of $29.49. We also granted 0.1 million off-cycle stock options during 2008 at an exercise price of $30.78.

On
May 3, 2007, our Board of Directors approved a stock option grant to our CEO to recognize her election as our Chairman. She received 300,000 stock options, which vest under varying market and service conditions and expire ten years after the
grant date. The grant had an insignificant impact on earnings in 2007.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $72 million in 2009,
$76 million in 2008 and $90 million in 2007. Cash received from options exercised was $79 million in 2009, $80 million in 2008 and $124 million in 2007. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from the option exercises
totaled $52 million in 2009, $44 million in 2008 and $35 million in 2007.

Restricted and Deferred Stock:

We may grant shares of restricted or deferred stock to eligible employees, giving them in most instances all of the rights of shareholders, except that they may not
sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber the shares. Shares of restricted and deferred stock are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. Restricted and deferred stock generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant
date.

Shares granted in connection with our long-term incentive plan vest based on varying performance, market and service conditions. The unvested
shares have no voting rights and do not pay dividends.

The fair value of the restricted and deferred shares at the date of grant is amortized to
earnings over the restriction period. We recorded compensation expense related to restricted and deferred stock of $133 million in 2009, $160 million in 2008 and $136 million in 2007. The deferred tax benefit recorded related to this
compensation expense was $44 million in 2009, $53 million in 2008 and $47 million in 2007. The unamortized compensation expense related to our restricted and deferred stock was $149 million at December 31, 2009 and is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years.

Our restricted and deferred stock activity for the year ended December 31, 2009
was:

In January 2009, we granted 1.5 million shares of stock in connection with our long-term incentive plan, and the market
value per share was $27.00 on the date of grant. In February 2009, as part of our annual equity program, we issued 4.1 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees, and the market value per restricted or deferred share
was $23.64 on the date of grant. We also issued 0.2 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2009, and the weighted-average market value per restricted or deferred share was $25.55 on the date of grant.

In January 2008, we granted 1.4 million shares of stock in connection with our long-term incentive plan, and the market value per share was $32.26 on the date of
grant. In February 2008, as part of our annual equity program, we issued 3.4 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees, and the market value per restricted or deferred share was $29.49 on the date of grant. We also
issued 0.2 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2008, and the weighted-average market value per restricted or deferred share was $30.38 on the date of grant. The total number of restricted and deferred shares issued
in 2008 was 5.0 million.

In January 2007, we issued 5.2 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees as part of our
annual equity program, and the market value per restricted or deferred share was $34.655 on the date of grant.


Additionally, we issued 1.0 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2007, and the weighted-average market value per restricted or deferred share was $34.085 on the
date of grant. The total number of restricted and deferred shares issued in 2007 was 9.2 million, including those issued as a result of our spin-off from Altria (discussed below).

The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted and deferred stock granted was $143 million, or $24.68 per restricted or deferred share, in 2009, $151 million, or $30.38 per restricted or deferred share,
in 2008 and $310 million, or $33.63 per restricted or deferred share, in 2007. The vesting date fair value of restricted and deferred stock was $153 million in 2009, $196 million in 2008, and $153 million in 2007.

Bifurcation of Stock Awards Upon Spin-Off from Altria:

Effective on the date of our spin-off, Altria stock awards were modified through the issuance of Kraft Foods stock awards, and accordingly, the Altria stock awards were split into two instruments. Holders of Altria stock options received:
1) a new Kraft Foods option to acquire shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock; and 2) an adjusted Altria stock option for the same number of shares of Altria common stock previously held, but with a proportionally reduced exercise price. For each
employee stock option outstanding, the aggregate intrinsic value immediately after our spin-off from Altria was not greater than the aggregate intrinsic value immediately prior to it. Holders of Altria restricted stock or stock rights awarded before
January 31, 2007 retained their existing awards and received restricted stock or stock rights in Kraft Foods Common Stock. Recipients of Altria restricted stock or stock rights awarded on or after January 31, 2007 did not receive Kraft
Foods restricted stock or stock rights because Altria had announced the spin-off at that time. We reimbursed Altria $179 million for net settlement of the employee stock awards. We determined the fair value of the stock options using the
Black-Scholes option valuation model, and adjusted the fair value of the restricted stock and stock rights by the value of projected forfeitures.

Based
upon the number of Altria stock awards outstanding upon our spin-off, we granted stock options for 24.2 million shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock at a weighted-average price of $15.75. The options expire between 2007 and 2012. In addition, we
issued 3.0 million shares of restricted stock and stock rights. The market value per restricted share or right was $31.66 on the date of grant. Restrictions on the majority of these restricted shares and stock rights lapsed in the first quarter
of either 2008 or 2009.

The projected benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of our pension plans at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were:


The following costs are included within other expenses above. Severance payments related to our Cost Savings Initiatives and
Restructuring Program, and retired employees who elected lump-sum payments resulted in settlement losses for our U.S. plans of $107 million in 2009, $74 million in 2008 and $68 million in 2007. In addition, we incurred a $5 million
curtailment charge in 2009 related to the freeze of certain of our U.S. pension plans. Non-U.S. plant closures and early retirement benefits resulted in curtailment and settlement losses of $8 million in 2009, $16 million in 2008 and
$4 million in 2007.

For the U.S. plans, we determine the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost using a calculated
market return value that recognizes the cost over a four year period. For our non-U.S. plans, we utilize a similar approach with varying cost recognition periods for some plans, and with others, we determine the expected return on plan assets based
on asset fair values as of the measurement date.


As of December 31, 2009, for the combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, we expected to amortize from
accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) into net periodic pension cost during 2010:

•

an estimated $244 million of net loss from experience differences; and

•

an estimated $12 million of prior service cost.

We used the following weighted-average assumptions to determine our net pension cost for the years ended December 31:

We excluded $172 million of plan assets from the above table related to certain insurance contracts as they are
reported at contract value, in accordance with authoritative guidance. U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities and government bonds are primarily classified as level one and are valued using quoted prices in active markets. Corporate bonds and
other fixed income securities are primarily classified as level two and are valued using independent observable market inputs, such as matrix pricing, yield curves and indices. Pooled funds, including assets in real estate pooled funds, are
primarily classified as level two and are valued using net asset values of participation units held in common collective trusts, as reported by the managers of the trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale
transactions. Level three assets are valued using unobservable inputs that reflect the plans’ own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets, based on the best information available, such as
investment manager pricing for limited partnerships using company financial statements, relevant valuation multiples and discounted cash flow analyses.


The percentage of fair value of pension plan assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was:



Components of Net Postretirement Health Care Costs:

Net postretirement health care costs consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

Other Costs:

We made
contributions to multiemployer medical plans totaling $35 million in 2009, $33 million in 2008 and $33 million in 2007.


Postemployment Benefit Plans

Obligations:

Our postemployment plans are not funded. The changes in the benefit obligations of the plans and
net amount accrued at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were:

The following costs are included within other expense above:

•

we incurred severance charges of $32 million related to our Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization and $170 million related to other Cost Savings Initiatives in 2009;

•

we reversed $77 million in severance charges in 2009 related to our Restructuring Program, as discussed in Note 6,

Restructuring Costs

; and

•

we incurred severance charges of $560 million in 2008 and $132 million in 2007 related to workforce reduction initiatives announced under the
Restructuring Program.

As of December 31, 2009, the estimated net loss for the postemployment benefit plans that we expected to
amortize from accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) into net postemployment costs during 2010 was insignificant.


Note 12.  Financial Instruments:

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

:

The fair values of
derivative instruments recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 were:


We record (i) the gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) into earnings,
(ii) the gain or loss on ineffectiveness, and (iii) the gain or loss on the amount excluded from effectiveness testing in:

•

cost of sales for commodity contracts;

•

cost of sales or marketing, administration and research costs for foreign exchange contracts related to forecasted transactions, depending on the type of
transaction; and

•

interest and other expense, net for interest rate contracts and foreign exchange contracts related to intercompany loans.

As of December 31, 2009, we expected to transfer unrealized losses of $2 million (net of taxes) for commodity cash flow hedges and unrealized gains of $5 million
(net of taxes) for foreign currency cash flow hedges to earnings during the next 12 months.

Hedge Coverage:

As of December 31, 2009, we had hedged forecasted transactions for the following durations:

•

commodity transactions for periods not exceeding the next 19 months;

•

interest rate transactions for periods not exceeding the next 33 years and 1 month; and

•

foreign currency transactions for periods not exceeding the next 24 months, and excluding intercompany loans, we had hedged forecasted foreign currency
transactions for periods not exceeding the next 12 months.


Fair Value Hedges:

The effect of fair value hedges for the year ended December 31, 2009 was:

For commodity contracts not designated as hedging instruments, the impact to earnings was insignificant in 2008, and we
recognized net gains of $56 million in 2007. For foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments, we recognized net losses of $50 million in 2008 and $231 million in 2007. The majority of these losses were attributable to hedges of
intercompany loans and were economically offset with foreign currency gains from the intercompany receivable.


Volume:

As of
December 31, 2009, we had the following outstanding hedges:


Note 14.   Income Taxes:

Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and the provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

Additionally, the 2008 earnings and gain from discontinued operations from the split-off of the

Post

cereals business
included a net tax benefit of $104 million.

As of January 1, 2009, our unrecognized tax benefits were $807 million. If we had recognized all of
these benefits, the net impact on our income tax provision would have been $612 million. Our unrecognized tax benefits were $829 million at December 31, 2009, and if we had recognized all of these benefits, the net impact on our income tax
provision would have been $661 million. We do not expect a significant change in our unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months. As this disclosure was made as of December 31, 2009, it does not reflect the impacts of our recent
acquisition and divestiture activity. We include accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. We had accrued interest and penalties of $239 million as of January 1, 2009 and $210 million as of
December 31, 2009. Our 2009 provision for income taxes included a $26 million net benefit for interest and penalties as reversals exceeded expense accruals during the year, due to agreements reached with the IRS on specific matters, settlements
with various foreign and state tax authorities and the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. We also paid interest and penalties of $10 million during 2009.


The changes in our unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were (in
millions):

Our 2009 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $225 million, primarily due to an agreement we reached
with the IRS on specific matters, settlements with various foreign and state tax authorities, the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and the divestiture of our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S.


Our 2008 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $222 million from discrete tax events. Of the total net
tax benefits, approximately $50 million related to fourth quarter corrections of state, federal and foreign tax liabilities and a third quarter reconciliation of our inventory of deferred tax items that resulted in a write-down of our net deferred
tax liabilities. The remaining net tax benefits primarily related to the resolution of various tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. Other discrete tax benefits included the impact from divestitures
of a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and several operations in Spain and the tax benefit from impairment charges taken in 2008. In addition, the 2008 tax rate benefited from foreign earnings taxed below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and
from the expected tax benefit of 2008 restructuring expenses. These benefits were only partially offset by state tax expense and certain foreign costs.

Our 2007 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $184 million, primarily including the effects of dividend repatriation benefits, foreign joint venture earnings, and the effect on foreign deferred taxes
from lower foreign tax rates enacted in 2007. The 2007 tax rate also benefited from foreign earnings taxed below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, an increased domestic manufacturing deduction and the divestiture of our flavored water and juice
brand assets and related trademarks. These benefits were partially offset by state tax expense, tax costs associated with the divestiture of our hot cereal assets and trademarks and interest income from Altria related to the transfer of our federal
tax contingencies discussed in Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

.

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to
deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following at December 31, 2009 and 2008:


Note 15.   Earnings Per Share:

Basic and diluted EPS from continuing and discontinued operations were calculated using the following:

We exclude antidilutive Kraft Foods stock options from our calculation of weighted-average shares for diluted EPS. We
excluded 23.0 million antidilutive options for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 11.3 million antidilutive options for the year ended December 31, 2008. We excluded an insignificant number of antidilutive options for the year
ended December 31, 2007.

Note 16.   Segment Reporting:

Kraft Foods manufactures and markets packaged food products, including snacks, beverages, cheese, convenient meals and various packaged grocery products. We manage and report operating results through three
geographic units: Kraft Foods North America, Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets. We manage the operations of Kraft Foods North America and Kraft Foods Europe by product category, and we manage the operations of Kraft Foods
Developing Markets by location. Our reportable segments are U.S. Beverages, U.S. Cheese, U.S. Convenient Meals, U.S. Grocery, U.S. Snacks, Canada & N.A. Foodservice, Kraft Foods Europe (formerly known as European Union) and Kraft Foods
Developing Markets.


Effective January 2009, we began implementing changes to our operating structure based on our Organizing For Growth
initiative and the Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization. In line with our strategies, we are reorganizing our European operations to function on a pan-European centralized category management and value chain model, and we changed how we work in Europe
in two key ways:

•

We transitioned our European Biscuit, Chocolate, Coffee and Cheese categories to fully integrated business units, further strengthening our focus on these core
categories. To ensure decisions are made faster and closer to our customers and consumers, each category is fully accountable for its financial results, including marketing, manufacturing and R&D. Category leadership, based in Zurich,
Switzerland, reports to the Kraft Foods Europe President. These business units now comprise the Kraft Foods Europe segment.

•

We aligned the reporting of our Central Europe operations into our Kraft Foods Developing Markets segment to help build critical scale in these countries. We
operate a country-led model in these markets.

Management uses segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate
resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales),
certain components of our U.S. pension plan cost (which is a component of cost of sales and marketing, administration and research costs), general corporate expenses (which are a component of marketing, administration and research costs) and
amortization of intangibles for all periods presented. In 2009, we began excluding certain components of our U.S. pension plan cost from segment operating income because we centrally manage pension plan funding decisions and the determination of
discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions. Therefore, we allocate only the service cost component of our U.S. pension plan expense to segment operating income. We exclude the unrealized gains and losses on
hedging activities from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Once realized, the gains and losses on hedging activities are recorded within segment operating results. Furthermore, we
centrally manage interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, we do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews. We use the same accounting policies for the segments as
those described in Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

.

Segment data were:


Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 16% of consolidated net
revenues in 2009, 16% in 2008 and 15% in 2007. These net revenues occurred primarily in the Kraft Foods North America segments.

In 2009, unrealized
gains on hedging activities of $203 million primarily resulted from the 2008 unrealized losses on energy derivatives becoming realized in 2009. In 2008, unrealized losses on hedging activities of $205 million were primarily related to energy
derivatives, including heating oil (used primarily to hedge transportation costs) and natural gas contracts. In 2009, general corporate expenses included $50 million of charges for legal matters related to certain of our European operations (see
Part I Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a description of these matters). In 2008, we recorded $72 million in charges for legal matters related to certain of our U.S. and European operations, including U.S. coffee operations and represented the
primary reason general corporate expenses increased $101 million in 2008.

We incurred costs associated with our Cost Savings Initiatives of $318
million in 2009. These charges were recorded in operations, primarily within the segment operating income of Kraft Foods Europe with the remainder spread across all other segments. In 2009, we also reversed $85 million of Restructuring Program
costs, with the majority relating to our Kraft Foods Europe segment while the remainder was spread across all other segments. We incurred Restructuring Program costs of $989 million in 2008 and $459 million in 2007. Refer to Note 6,

Restructuring Costs

, for a breakout of the 2008 and 2007 charges by segment. We also incurred asset impairment charges of $21 million in 2009 related to our Kraft Foods Europe segment, $140 million in 2008 related to our Kraft Foods Europe
and Kraft Foods Developing Markets segments, and $120 million in 2007 related to our U.S. Beverages segment. Refer to Note 5,

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

, for further details of these charges.


As described in Note 2,

Acquisitions and Divestitures

, we divested several operations, and recorded net
gains / (losses) on these divestitures in segment operating income as follows:



Basic and diluted EPS are computed independently for each of the periods presented. Accordingly, the sum of the
quarterly EPS amounts may not equal the total for the year.


Note 18.  Subsequent Events:

We evaluated subsequent events through February 16, 2010 and included all accounting and disclosure requirements related to subsequent events in our financial statements.


Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the
end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009, and noted the following significant changes.

•

In 2008, we began implementing “Catalyst,” a business initiative to simplify and harmonize our systems processes. This multi-year program includes the
delivery of SAP enterprise software applications and business solutions. During the quarter ended December 31, 2009, we transitioned some of our processes and procedures into the SAP control environment. As we migrate to the SAP environment,
our management ensures that our key controls are mapped to applicable SAP controls, tests transition controls prior to the migration date of those controls, and as appropriate, maintains and evaluates controls over the flow of information to and
from SAP. We expect the transition period to be completed in 2011.

We determined that there were no other changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America;

•

provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect
on the consolidated financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and
internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2009. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

Management reviewed the results of our assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on this assessment, management determined
that, as of December 31, 2009, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent
registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements included in this report, has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009.

February 16, 2010


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Kraft Foods Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of equity and of cash flows appearing in Item 8 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Kraft Foods Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions and the timing of its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests in 2007, the manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and
other postretirement plans in 2008, and the manner in which it accounts for inventories and noncontrolling interests in 2009.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
