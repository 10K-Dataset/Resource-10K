PART I

Item 1. Business.

General

We are one of the world’s largest snack companies with global net revenues of $34.2 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.2 billion in
2014. We manufacture and market delicious snack food and beverage products for consumers in approximately 165 countries around the world. Our portfolio includes nine billion dollar brands—

LU, Nabisco

and

Oreo

biscuits;

Cadbury,
Cadbury Dairy Milk

and

Milka

chocolates;

Trident

gum;

Jacobs

coffee and

Tang

powdered beverages. Our portfolio includes 58 brands that each generated annual revenues of $100 million or more in 2014.

We are proud members of the NASDAQ 100 and Standard & Poor’s 500. Our Common Stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol
“MDLZ.” We have been incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia since 2000.



We have been recognized for our ongoing economic, environmental and social contributions and this year were listed again on
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (“DJSI”) – World and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability
programs within each industry. We also participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project Climate and Water forums and continue to disclose and work to reduce our carbon and water footprints. We are committed to continue this and other related work in the
areas of sustainable resources and agriculture, mindful snacking, community partnerships and safety of our products and people. Please see

www.mondelezinternational.com/well-being

for more information.

Strategy

We intend to leverage our core strengths, including our
significant global presence, market leadership positions and portfolio of iconic brands and innovation platforms, to achieve two primary goals: deliver top-tier financial performance and be a great place to work. We plan to achieve these goals by
executing five long-term strategies:

•

Unleash the Power of Our People.

We believe that our two company goals, to deliver top-tier financial performance and to be a great place to work, are interdependent and that one is not fully achievable without
the other. Being a great place to work enables us to recruit, retain and unleash the talents of great people. We strive to maintain balance between our two goals and remain focused on evolving our ways of working, our standards of leadership and the
development opportunities available to our colleagues.

•

Transform Snacking

. Driving growth is at the forefront of our long-term business strategies. By meeting the needs of consumers through innovation of our portfolio of products, we expect to grow and maintain our
Power Brands and market-leading positions.

Our global Power Brands continue to be a significant competitive advantage. Our Power
Brands include global brands such as

Oreo, LU

and

belVita

biscuits;

Milka

,

Cadbury Dairy Milk and Lacta

chocolate;

Halls

candy;

Trident

gum;

Tang

powdered beverages and

Jacobs

,

Tassimo

and

Carte Noire

coffee. Our brands enable us to fulfill consumer needs with a full range of snacking choices. Our global innovation platforms allow us to quickly adapt successful products from one market to many others and by addressing the
different needs of our consumers.

Beginning in 2015, we changed our regional operating structure to create greater category management leadership
and structure within each of our regions, as we have in place within our Europe and North America regions. We expect these changes to lead to further global and local consumer-preferred innovations and accelerate our speed to market.

•

Revolutionize Selling.

As part of our focus on growth around the world and particularly in emerging markets, we have heavily invested in our routes to market and sales capabilities. In 2014, we continued to
develop our sales and distribution capabilities across key markets, and we made significant improvements in our marketing effectiveness and spending. We expanded our brand presence across digital media and continue to make our working media more
effective, extending our reach and marketing budgets. By making smart choices on our advertising and marketing effectiveness and spending, we can invest more in our brands and further strengthen our support to grow the business.

•

Drive Efficiency to Fuel Growth.

We manage our business through a virtuous cycle. To drive sales and earnings growth, we focus first on delivering high quality products that meet consumer needs. We expand our
margins through leveraging lean and simple cost management programs within our integrated supply chain and through overhead discipline. Savings can be reinvested to pursue additional targeted growth opportunities within our portfolio. As we
announced in May 2014, under our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, we are currently working to reduce our annual operating costs by at least $1.5 billion by the program’s completion at the end of 2018.

•

Protect the Well-being of Our Planet.

We are committed to growing our business while protecting our planet and its people. We strive to enhance the well-being of the people who enjoy and make our products and to
nurture thriving communities where we live, work and grow the ingredients that go into our products. To accomplish these objectives, we focus on delivering safe, high-quality foods and ensuring a safe work environment for our employees. We are
working to protect resources, focusing on where we can have the greatest impact. We are also creating food that fits the way people eat today and provides balanced snacking choices. Our “Call For Well-Being” initiative focuses on four
areas that we believe will have the greatest impact: sustainability, mindful snacking, safety and community partnerships. In each of these areas, we set clear goals and metrics. For more information on the progress of our Call For Well-Being
initiative, please see

.

Customers

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2014. Our five largest customers accounted for 15.7% and our ten largest
customers accounted for 23.7% of net revenues from continuing operations in 2014.

Seasonality

Demand for our products is generally balanced over the first three quarters of the year and increases in the fourth quarter primarily because of holidays and other
seasonal events.

Competition

We face competition in all aspects of our
business. Competitors include large multi-national as well as numerous local and regional companies. Some competitors have different profit objectives than we do and therefore approach pricing and promotional decisions differently. We compete based
on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, service, product innovation, taste, convenience, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, effectiveness of sales and marketing, routes to market and distribution networks,
promotional activity and price. Improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial research, development, advertising and promotional expenditures. We believe these investments lead to a better value proposition for the
consumer.



Distribution and Marketing

Across our segments, we generally sell our products to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, convenience stores,
gasoline stations, drug stores, value stores and other retail food outlets. We distribute our products through direct store delivery, company-owned and satellite warehouses, distribution centers and other facilities. We also use the services of
independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations.

We conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities:
(i) consumer marketing and advertising including on-air, print, outdoor, digital and social media and other product promotions; (ii) consumer sales incentives such as coupons and rebates; and (iii) trade promotions to support price
features, displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers.

Raw Materials and Packaging

We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, coffee, dairy, wheat, corn products, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners and
nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses. We regularly monitor worldwide supply, cost and currency trends
related to these commodities so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and energy sources required for production.

A number of external factors such
as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We use hedging
techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials. However, we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs.

While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will
generally remain available from numerous sources. For additional information on our commodity costs, refer to the

Commodity Trends

section within

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

.

Intellectual Property

Our intellectual property rights
(including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, technology and know-how) are material to our business.

We own numerous
trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable,
fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents
extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from
country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our
business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.

From time to time, we grant third parties
licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third party products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods
Group, Inc., we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the Spin-Off.



Research and Development

We
pursue four objectives in research and development: product safety and quality, growth through new products, superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately 2,650 food scientists, chemists and
engineers working primarily in 11 key technology centers: East Hanover, New Jersey; Whippany, New Jersey; Banbury, United Kingdom; Bournville, United Kingdom; Curitiba, Brazil; Paris, France; Melbourne, Australia; Mexico City, Mexico; Munich,
Germany; Reading, United Kingdom and Suzhou, China. Our research and development expense was $455 million in 2014, $471 million in 2013 and $462 million in 2012.

Regulation

Our food products and packaging materials are subject to local,
national and multi-national regulations related to labeling, packaging, food ingredients, pricing, marketing and advertising, privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing our manufacturing
plants, enforcing standards for selected food products, grading food products, inspecting manufacturing plants and warehouses and regulating trade practices related to the sale of and imposing their own labeling requirements on our food products.
Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review.

Throughout the countries in which we do business, government authorities are continually adopting new laws and implementing new regulations that affect our
business and operations. Examples include selective food taxes in Mexico; profit, price and other controls imposed within Venezuela and Argentina; Russian sanctions on the sourcing of raw materials from the European Union and potential labeling
disclosure requirements for genetically modified ingredients in the United States. We will continue to monitor developments of the new laws and regulations. At this time, we do not expect the cost of complying with these new laws and regulations
will be material. Also refer to Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting

, for additional information on government regulations and currency effects on our operations in
Venezuela, Argentina and Russia.

Environmental Regulation

Throughout
the countries in which we do business, we are subject to local, national and multi-national environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable
environmental compliance requirements. In the United States, the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party. As of December 31, 2014, our subsidiaries were involved in one active proceeding in the United States under a state
equivalent of CERCLA related to our current operations. As of December 31, 2014, we accrued an immaterial amount for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of the existing
environmental remediation and our compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results.

Employees

We employed approximately 104,000 people worldwide at December 31, 2014 and approximately 107,000 at December 31, 2013. Employees represented by
labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 64% of our 91,000 employees outside the United States and approximately 28% of our 13,000 U.S. employees. Our business units are subject to various local, national and multi-national
laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. In accordance with European Union requirements, we also have established a European Workers Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We believe we
generally have good relationships with our employees and their representative organizations.

Foreign Operations

We generated 82.1% of our 2014 net revenues, 83.1% of our 2013 net revenues and 82.9% of our 2012 net revenues from continuing operations outside the United States. We
sell our products to consumers in approximately 165 countries. At December 31, 2014, we had operations in more than 80 countries and made our products at 170 manufacturing and processing facilities in 58 countries. Refer to Note 17,

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

You should read the following risk factors carefully when evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe we have identified and discussed
below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may adversely affect our business, performance or financial
condition in the future.

We operate in a highly competitive industry.

The food and snacking industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors include major international food, snack and beverage companies that, like us, operate in
multiple geographic areas as well as numerous local and regional companies. We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, service, product innovation, taste, convenience, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer
preferences, effectiveness of sales and marketing, routes to market and distribution networks, promotional activity and price. If we do not effectively respond to challenges from our competitors, our business could be adversely affected.

Competitor and customer pressures may require that we reduce our prices. These pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and
other cost increases. Failure to effectively assess, change and set proper pricing may negatively impact the achievement of our strategic and financial goals. The emergence of new distribution channels, such as Internet sales directly to consumers,
may affect customer and consumer preferences, cost structures or margins. We may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase market share. These expenditures might not
result in trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we reduce prices or our costs increase but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset those changes, then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer.

In addition, companies in our industry are under increasing pressure to improve the efficiency of their overall cost structures. We have announced a transformation
agenda with the goals of focusing our portfolio, improving our cost structure and operating model, and accelerating our growth. If we do not achieve these objectives in a way that minimizes disruptions to our business, our financial condition and
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Maintaining, extending and expanding our reputation and brand image is essential to our
business success.

Our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products, extend our brands into new geographies and to new
distribution platforms, including online, and expand our brand image with new product offerings.



We seek to maintain, extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments, including advertising and consumer
promotions, and product innovation. Continuing global focus on health and wellness, including weight management, and increasing attention from the media, shareholders, consumers, activists and other stakeholders on the role of food marketing could
adversely affect our brand image. It could also lead to stricter regulations and increased focus on food and snacking marketing practices. Increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising, consumer promotions and marketing, or our
response to those restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend and expand our brands. Moreover, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, product quality and safety, or environmental and human rights risks in our
supply chain could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or these matters are immaterial to our operations.

In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment,
including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns. We are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products. These restrictions may
limit our ability to maintain, extend and expand our brand image, particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve. Negative posts or comments about us on social networking web sites (whether factual or not) or
security breaches related to use of our social media and failure to respond effectively to these posts, comments or activities could seriously damage our reputation and brand image across the various regions in which we operate. In addition, we
might fail to invest sufficiently in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image. As a result, we might be required to recognize impairment charges on our intangible assets or goodwill. If we do not successfully maintain, extend and expand
our reputation and brand image, then our brands, product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We are
subject to risks from operating globally.

We are a global company and generated 82.1% of our 2014 net revenues, 83.1% of our 2013 net revenues and 82.9% of our
2012 net revenues outside the United States. We manufacture and market our products in approximately 165 countries and have operations in more than 80 countries, so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations. Those risks include:

•

compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”);

•

compliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple regimes;

•

changes in tax laws, interpretation of tax laws and tax audit outcomes;

•

currency devaluations or fluctuations in currency values, including in developing markets such as Venezuela, Argentina and Russia as well as in developed markets such as countries within the European Union;

•

changes in capital controls, including currency exchange controls, government currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or repatriate cash from outside the United
States;

•

discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies;

•

increased sovereign risk, such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit ratings of governments;

•

changes in local regulations and laws, the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other
resources;

•

varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights;

•

greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles;

•

design, implementation and use of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base; and

•

the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or regulations, taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales.

In addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public
corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. The slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain
consumer spending, and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability. Continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the European Union or the dynamics associated with the federal
and state debt and budget challenges in the United States could adversely affect us. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and
results of operations.



Our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political, economic and regulatory risks.

Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets, including Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, Venezuela, Argentina,
Ukraine, the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. However, some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets. In many
countries outside of the United States, particularly those with emerging economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery
Act, or local anti-bribery laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials, including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions
necessary to do business. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their
production capacities. Our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy. If we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political, economic and regulatory risks, our product sales,
financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability
to provide our products to our customers.

We manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale. We have a complex network of suppliers, owned
manufacturing locations, co-manufacturing locations, distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, like weather,
natural disasters, fire, explosions, terrorism, political unrest, generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or co-manufacturers’ operations. If we do not effectively respond to
disruptions in our operations, for example, by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations, or cannot quickly repair damage to our information, production or supply systems, we may be late in
delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers. If that occurs, we may lose our customers’ confidence, and long-term consumer demand for our products could decline. In addition, we might not have the functions, processes or
organizational capability necessary to achieve on our anticipated timeframes our strategic ambition to reconfigure our supply chain and drive efficiencies to fuel growth. Further, changes to regulatory restrictions within the markets in which we
operate may impact our ability to supply multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint. These events could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations.

At December 31,
2014, we sold our products in approximately 165 countries and had operations in more than 80 countries. A significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive
to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes or converted into U.S. dollars to service obligations such as our U.S.
dollar-denominated indebtedness and dividends. In addition, movements in currency exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries. We seek to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate
fluctuations, primarily on cross-currency transactions, but our efforts may not be successful. Accordingly, changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes or for
transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Commodity and other input
prices are volatile and may rise significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained.

We purchase and use large quantities of commodities,
including cocoa, coffee, dairy, wheat, corn products, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, and nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels and
electricity for our factories and warehouses. Prices for these raw materials, other supplies and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict. These conditions include global competition for resources,
currency fluctuations, political conditions, severe weather, the potential longer-term consequences of climate change on agricultural productivity, crop disease or pests, water risk, health pandemics, consumer or industrial demand, and changes in
governmental trade, alternative energy and agricultural programs. Many of the commodities we purchase are grown by smallholder farmers, who might lack the capacity to invest to increase



productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases, we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity
costs, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our
profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products to cover increased input costs may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our
revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply of key commodities may limit our ability to grow our net revenues. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce
our prices, or if we are limited by supply constraints, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Changes in
laws and regulations could increase our costs.

Our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight. Various laws and
regulations govern food production, storage, distribution, sales, advertising and marketing, as well as licensing, trade, labor, tax and environmental matters, and health and safety practices. Government authorities regularly change laws and
regulations and their interpretations. Our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and
results of operations.

We may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or manage changes in our
workforce.

We must hire, retain and develop effective leaders and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce. We compete to hire new personnel in the many
countries in which we manufacture and market our products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies. Unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or hire and retain a diverse global
workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness.

We also face increased personnel-related risks in connection with implementing the changes in our transformation agenda related to our operating model and business
processes. These risks could lead to operational challenges, including increased competition for employees with the skills we require to achieve our business goals, higher employee turnover, including of employees with key capabilities, and
challenges in developing the capabilities necessary to transform our business processes. Furthermore, we might be unable to manage changes in, or that affect, our workforce appropriately or satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we
manage and compensate our employees. This includes our management of employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils, who represent approximately 64% of our 91,000 employees outside the United States and approximately 28% of our
13,000 U.S. employees.

These risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation, ability to meet the needs of our customers, product sales, financial
condition and results of operations.

We must address risks related to consolidation of retail customers and leverage our value proposition in order to compete
against retailer and other economy brands.

Retail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors in the European Union, the United
States and our other major markets, continue to consolidate, resulting in fewer but larger customers with whom we can conduct business. Larger, more sophisticated retail customers and alliances among customers can resist price increases, delist or
reduce the shelf space allotted to our products, and demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs, longer payment terms or specifically tailored products. In addition, larger retail customers have the scale to develop supply chains that
permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products. Our products must provide higher quality or value to our consumers than the less expensive
alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Consumers may not buy our products if consumers perceive the difference in the quality or value between our products and retailer or other economy brands has narrowed. If consumers
switch to purchasing or otherwise prefer retailer or other economy brands, then we could lose market share or sales volumes or need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings.

Retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material
adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases.



If we do not effectively respond to retail consolidation, increasing retail power and competition from retailer and other
economy brands, our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We are subject to and
may fail to manage changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers.

During 2014, our five largest customers accounted for 15.7% of our net
revenues. There can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and
develop their own brands. The loss of or disruptions related to significant customers, such as the disruptions we experienced in 2014 with customers in France, could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to
a significant customer. This could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, disputes with
significant suppliers, including those related to pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of
operations.

We may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims.

We could decide, or laws or regulations could require us, to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination, spoilage or other adulteration,
product misbranding or product tampering. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this
category. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We may also
suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, or if our products cause injury, illness or death. In addition, our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant
product liability or other legal judgment against us, a related regulatory enforcement action or a widespread product recall could materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability. Moreover, even if a product liability or consumer
fraud claim is unsuccessful, has no merit or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of
operations.

We could be subject to legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions.

We are a large food and snacking company operating in highly regulated environments and constantly evolving legal, tax and regulatory frameworks around the world.
Consequently, we are subject to greater risk of litigation, legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate policies and procedures we have implemented
to promote compliance with existing laws and regulations. Moreover, our failure to maintain effective control environment processes could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. Litigation, legal or tax claims or
regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or controls could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product
sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.

We evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, minority investments and other strategic alliances that
could further our strategic business objectives. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing
business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary
consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively
implement control environment processes with employees joining us as a result of a transaction; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential
loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners.



With respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability
to conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated
with the integration of operations; and coordinate antitrust and competition laws in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions. Joint ventures and strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we share ownership and management
responsibilities with one or more other parties who may not have the same objectives, priorities, strategies or resources as we do. In May 2014, we entered into an agreement to combine our wholly owned coffee portfolio (outside of France) with D.E
Master Blenders 1753 B.V., and in conjunction with that transaction, Acorn Holdings B.V., owner of D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V., made a binding offer to receive our coffee business in France. We might not effectively separate our coffee business,
integrate our operations into the new venture or complete the transaction on the anticipated timeframe. Furthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our
strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take
action to reduce costs that remain after a divestiture is completed. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.

Any of these risks and challenges could materially and adversely affect our business, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We must correctly predict, identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new products to meet those changes.

Consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify and interpret the tastes, dietary
habits, packaging and other preferences of consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to these preferences. Moreover, weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other factors could affect consumer preferences
and demand. If we do not offer products that appeal to consumers or if we misjudge consumer demand for our products, our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer.

We must distinguish among short-term fads, mid-term trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer
preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales could decline. In addition, because of our varied consumer base, including by geography, we must offer an array of products
that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories, demand for our
products could decrease and our profitability could suffer.

Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could
influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. For example, recently, consumers have increasingly focused on health and wellness, including weight management and reducing sodium and added sugar
consumption. In addition, consumer preferences differ by region, and we must monitor and adjust our use of ingredients to respond to these regional preferences. We might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer
preferences and social expectations. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect us, and we have not maintained effective internal controls over our
accounting for income taxes.

The accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations. These limitations
include, among others, the possibility of human error, inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud. If we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements, we could be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis. As a result, our reputation, results of operations and stock price could be
materially adversely affected.



In connection with management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, we determined that we did not maintain effective monitoring and oversight of controls over the completeness, accuracy and presentation of our accounting for income taxes,
including the income tax provision and related tax assets and liabilities. We determined that the ineffective monitoring and oversight of controls over income tax accounting constituted a material weakness. As of December 31, 2014, we made
substantial progress toward remediating the material weakness. See Item 9A,

Controls and Procedures

, for a discussion of the material weakness and the progress on the remediation. If the new controls we have implemented to address the
material weakness and to strengthen our overall internal control over accounting for income taxes are not designed or do not operate effectively, if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following these new processes or if we are otherwise unable
to remediate this material weakness, we may not timely or accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. This could adversely affect our stock price and the confidence of investors, business partners and others in our financial
reports.

We are increasingly dependent on information technology.

We
rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax
requirements. We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our personnel, customers and suppliers around the world. These information technology systems, many of
which are managed by third parties or used in connection with shared service centers, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof,
power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers or other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events. Furthermore, to the extent our
information technology systems are managed by third parties or used in connection with external shared service centers, we would have to coordinate with these third parties to try to resolve issues related to these events. If any of our significant
information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition and results of
operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results.

In addition, if we are unable to prevent
physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of
confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, suppliers or employees. The mishandling or inappropriate disclosure of non-public sensitive or protected information could lead to the loss of intellectual property, negatively
impact planned corporate transactions or damage our reputation and brand image. Misuse, leakage or falsification of legally protected information could also result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and have a negative impact on our
reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

Weak financial performance, downgrades in our credit ratings, illiquid global capital
markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the global capital markets, reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs.

We
may need to access the long-term and short-term global capital markets to obtain financing. Our financial performance, our short-and long-term debt credit ratings, interest rates, the stability of financial institutions with which we partner, the
liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy, including the food industry, will affect our access to, and the availability or cost of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future. There can be no
assurance that we will have access to the global capital markets on terms we find acceptable.

We regularly access the commercial paper markets in the United States
and Europe for ongoing funding requirements. A downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper. Disruptions in the global commercial paper market
or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short- and long-term debt offerings.

Limitations on our ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations.



Volatility in the equity markets, interest rates or other factors could substantially increase our pension costs.

We sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for our employees throughout the world. At the end of 2014, the projected benefit obligation of our
defined benefit pension plans was $12.5 billion and plan assets were $9.6 billion. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and
the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of investments, including equities and corporate debt. Among other factors, changes in
interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, investment returns, minimum funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate, the viability of other employers in the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate
and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding, cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and increase our future funding requirements. Legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding
requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation.

Volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we are required to make
additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension cost. A portion of our pension trust assets is invested in European sovereign debt and subject to heightened risk that it could lose value as a
result of political and financial turmoil in Europe.

Due to our participation in multi-employer pension plans, we may have exposure under those plans that extends
beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our employees. Our contributions to a multi-employer plan may increase beyond our bargaining obligations depending on the financial condition of the multi-employer plan. We may be required to
participate in funding the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable to a withdrawing employer, and our costs might increase as a result. Further, if we have a partial or complete withdrawal from a multi-employer pension plan, we may be required to
pay an amount to the plan based on our allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan. This liability will generally increase if other employers cease participating in the plan whether or not due to bankruptcy. (See Note 10,

Benefit
Plans

, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our multiemployer pension plans.)

A significant increase in our pension benefit
obligations or funding requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in the business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and our failure to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.

We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licensing agreements, to
be a significant and valuable part of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in various countries, as well as licensing
agreements, third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes
that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.

We may be unaware of third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology, brands or products. Any litigation regarding patents or other
intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations. Third party claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay
monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales,
financial condition and results of operations.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.

Description of the Company

We manufacture and market primarily snack food
and beverage products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy, coffee & powdered beverages and various cheese & grocery products. We have operations in more than 80 countries and
sell our products in approximately 165 countries.

Over the last several years, we have been expanding geographically and building our presence in the snacking
category. At the same time, we continued to invest in product quality, marketing and innovation behind our iconic brands, while implementing a series of cost saving initiatives. Our goals are to achieve industry-leading revenue growth over time
along with the higher expected growth rates of advantaged snack categories; leverage our cost structure through supply chain reinvention, productivity programs, overhead streamlining, volume growth and improved product mix to drive margin gains; and
grow earnings per share in the top-tier of our peer group.

Planned Coffee Business Transactions

On May 7, 2014, we announced that we entered into an agreement to combine our wholly owned coffee portfolio (outside of France) with D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V.
(“DEMB”). In conjunction with this transaction, Acorn Holdings B.V. (“AHBV”), owner of DEMB, has also made a binding offer to receive our coffee business in France. The parties have also invited our partners in certain joint
ventures to join the new company.

Upon completion of all proposed transactions, we expect to receive cash of approximately

€

4 billion and a 49 percent equity interest in the new company, to be called Jacobs Douwe Egberts (“JDE”). AHBV will hold a majority share in the proposed combined company and will have
a majority of the seats on the board, which will be chaired by current DEMB Chairman Bart Becht. We will have certain minority rights. AHBV is owned by an investor group led by JAB Holding Company s.à r.l.

The transactions (collectively, the “JDE coffee transactions”) remain subject to regulatory approvals and the completion of employee information and
consultation requirements. We continue to expect the transactions to be completed in 2015, subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. In December 2014, the European Commission announced its intention to further evaluate the
proposed transaction against EU antitrust regulations in order to make a final determination on merger clearance, which we currently expect in the second half of 2015. We and DEMB also continue to undertake consultations with Works Councils and
employee representatives as required in connection with the transactions.

In connection with the expected receipt of approximately

€

4 billion upon closing, we entered into currency exchange forward contracts in the second quarter of 2014 to lock in an expected U.S. dollar value of approximately $5 billion. As of December 31,
2014, the forward contracts were recorded as derivative assets within other current assets and through December 31, 2014, we recognized $628 million of unrealized gains related to the hedges within interest and other expense, net. On
February 11, 2015, we monetized the forward contracts and recorded an additional realized gain of $311 million in the first quarter of 2015, for a total realized gain of $939 million. We also entered into new currency exchange forward
contracts to continue to lock in an expected U.S. dollar value of approximately $5 billion from the transactions. Based on changes in the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate, the actual closing date of the planned JDE coffee transactions and the
settlement dates of the hedges or other hedges we may put into place, the actual amount of U.S. dollars we receive could change. In addition to the hedges, we have also incurred incremental expenses related to readying our coffee businesses for the
planned transactions that totaled $77 million through December 31, 2014 and were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses of our Europe and EEMEA segments and within our general corporate expenses. For additional information
on the JDE coffee transactions, see Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions—Planned Coffee Business Transactions

.



2014-2018 Restructuring Program

On May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a $3.5 billion restructuring program, comprised of approximately $2.5 billion in cash costs and $1 billion in
non-cash costs (the “2014-2018 Restructuring Program”), and up to $2.2 billion of capital expenditures. The primary objective of the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program is to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and
overhead costs. We expect the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by the program’s completion at the end of 2018. Lower overheads and accelerated supply chain cost reductions are each expected
to generate roughly half of the total incremental savings. We expect to incur the majority of the program’s charges in 2015 and 2016 and to complete the program by year-end 2018. In 2014, we recorded restructuring and related implementation
charges of $381 million under this program. For additional information on the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, see Note 6,

S

ummary of Results

•

Net revenues decreased 3.0% to $34.2 billion in 2014 and increased 0.8% to $35.3 billion in 2013. Net revenues in 2014 were significantly affected by unfavorable currency translation as the U.S. dollar strengthened
against most currencies in which we operate.

•

Organic Net Revenue increased 2.4% to $36.0 billion in 2014 and increased 3.9% to $35.9 billion in 2013. Organic Net Revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate our underlying results (see the definition
of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

appearing later in this section).

•

Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International decreased 41.6% to $1.28 in 2014 and increased 28.1% to $2.19 in 2013. Excluding the results of discontinued operations, our diluted EPS attributable to
Mondelēz International from continuing operations decreased 0.8% to $1.28 in 2014 and increased 46.6% to $1.29 in 2013. A number of significant items also affected the comparability of our reported results, as further described in the

Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results

appearing later in this section and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

•

Adjusted EPS increased 14.3% to $1.76 in 2014 and increased 7.7% to $1.54 in 2013. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 23.4% to $1.90 in 2014 and increased 11.9% to $1.60 in 2013. Adjusted EPS is a
non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

appearing later in this section).

Fi

nancial Outlook

We seek to achieve top-tier
financial performance. We manage our business to achieve this goal using a number of operating metrics including Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. (Refer to

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

appearing later in this
section for more information on these measures.) Additional metrics that we use or monitor include product quality measures, category growth, market share performance, pricing net of commodity costs, net commodity inflation, volume growth, Power
Brand Organic Net Revenue growth, gross and net productivity savings, brand support and related investments, capital spending, cash conversion cycle, free cash flow, return on invested capital and shareholder returns. We also monitor a number of
factors and trends that we expect may impact our near- and long-term revenues and profitability objectives:

Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends

– Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of the population and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class particularly in emerging markets. Over the long-term, we expect these
trends to continue leading to growth in key consumer behaviors, including increased snacking occasions, greater use of convenience food and migration to more frequent, smaller meals. In the near term, lower GDP growth, high unemployment and weak
consumer confidence in Europe and emerging markets has slowed category and our growth.

Demand

– We monitor consumer spending and our market
share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. Growth in the global categories slowed from approximately 4% in 2013 to 3.6% in 2014. We believe the slowdown in category growth will continue to affect our near-term net
revenue growth, but we expect the slowdown, particularly in emerging markets, to be temporary. We expect category growth to return to levels more in line with the expected growth of emerging markets and consumer spending in those markets. We
continue to make investments in our brands and build strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets. In doing so, we anticipate stimulating demand in our categories and growing our position in these
markets.



Volatility of Global Markets

– Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations,
particularly in emerging markets. Some of these markets have greater political and economic volatility and vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions as we experienced this past year in markets including Russia, Ukraine, Venezuela and
Argentina. Volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business. There will likely be continued volatility across these and other markets in which we sell. As such,
we are focused on aggressively managing our costs currently as we continue to invest in brand building and routes to market.

Competition

– We
operate in highly competitive markets that include global, regional and local competitors. Our advantaged geographic footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions
across most of the product categories in which we sell. To grow and maintain our market positions, we focus on product quality, bringing new products and innovations to market and effectively meeting consumer needs and preferences. We pursue
significant growth opportunities such as expanding our global operations and growing our portfolio of Power Brands and innovative products. We continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing
research and development, advertising and marketing consumer promotions.

Pricing

– We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables
including demand, the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs. Our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions. In 2014, we generally increased prices in response to
higher commodity costs, currency and other market factors. In 2015, we continue to expect higher aggregate commodity and related costs and anticipate adjusting our prices in response to changing market conditions. Price competition or delayed price
increases by competitors or customers also affected our net revenues in 2014 and may continue to affect net revenues or market share in the near term until the market adjusts to the changes in input costs and other market conditions. In 2015, we
plan to address some of these issues and improve our revenue mix by discontinuing certain low margin, customer-specific product lines, discontinuing certain low-margin licensed products and continuing to simplify our portfolio of SKUs.

Operating Costs

– Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing
costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. We continue to work on various programs to expand our profitability and margins, such as our
2014-2018 Restructuring Program designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs.

Currency

– As a global company with over 80% of our net revenues generated outside the United States, we are exposed to changes in global economic
conditions and currency movements. In 2014, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to other currencies in which we operate and as several countries experienced significant declines in or devaluations of their currency, these currency movements had
a significant negative effect on our reported results of operations. Our 2014 net revenues were $34.2 billion, down 3.0% from 2013, including a negative 5.1 percentage point impact from currency translation. While we have net investment hedges in
the form of local currency denominated debt to offset the translation of certain of our overseas investments, we generally do not hedge against currency translation. We primarily seek to hedge against economic losses on cross-currency transactions.
Due to limited markets for hedging currency transactions and other factors, we may not be able to effectively hedge all of our cross-currency transaction risks. During 2014, we recognized $167 million of currency devaluation charges in pretax
earnings related to the remeasurement of our net monetary assets in Venezuela. The economy, monetary policies and other business restrictions in Venezuela, as well as in other countries such as Argentina and Russia, have created a challenging
business environment in which to operate, and our ability to hedge against currency-related economic losses may be limited. While we work to mitigate our exposure to these currency risks, factors such as continued global market volatility, actions
by foreign governments, political uncertainty and other external developments could lead to further unfavorable currency impacts in the future.

Financing Costs

– We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. We continue to use lower cost short- and long-term debt to finance our ongoing
working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter of 2014 and fourth quarter of 2013, we retired $5 billion of our long-term U.S. dollar-denominated debt and issued lower-cost
long-term euro and U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2014 was 4.3%, down from 4.8% as of December 31, 2013 and down from 5.8% as of December 31, 2012.

Organic Net Revenue growth was
driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Overall, net pricing was up as we realized the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions implemented over the course of the year. Higher net pricing was reflected primarily
in Latin America, EEMEA, Europe and Asia Pacific. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven primarily by Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. In addition to price elasticity, the decline was largely due to a slow response by competitors to higher input
costs as well as the impact of price-related customer disruptions in Europe. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,806 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the U.S. dollar
relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Brazilian real and Ukrainian hryvnya, partially offset by the strength of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar. The impact of divestitures completed in
2013 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $70 million and included a salty snacks business in Turkey, a confectionery business in South Africa and a chocolate business in Spain. The accounting calendar change made in Europe in
2013 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $38 million. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco on February 22, 2013 added $14 million in incremental net revenues this year for the period prior to the anniversary
date of the acquisition.

During 2014, higher net pricing
outpaced increased input costs. Higher net pricing was reflected across all segments. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially
offset by lower manufacturing costs. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, partially offset by gains in EEMEA and North America.



Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $222 million from 2013, due to a number of factors noted in
the table above, including in part, a favorable currency impact, lower Integration Program costs, value-added tax (“VAT”)-related settlements in 2014, lower Spin-Off Costs, 2013 business divestitures and a gain on a sale of property in
2014. Items that increased selling, general and administrative expenses included a 2013 benefit received related to the resolution of a Cadbury acquisition indemnification, increased devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in
Venezuela, costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, costs incurred in 2014 related to the JDE coffee transactions, gains on property sales in 2013 and higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs.

Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $313 million from 2013, driven primarily by lower overhead costs and lower
advertising and consumer promotion costs. Overhead costs fell as a result of continued cost reduction efforts. Advertising and consumer promotion costs were lower due primarily to savings from consolidating media providers, reductions in non-working
media costs and efficiencies gained by shifting spending to lower-cost, digital media outlets, while we increased our spending on our Power Brands and maintained working media spending.

The change in unrealized gains / (losses) decreased operating income by $174 million in 2014. In 2014, the net unrealized losses on primarily commodity hedging activity
were $112 million, as compared to net unrealized gains of $62 million in 2013 related to currency and commodity hedging activity. In 2013, we recorded pre-tax gains of $68 million related to sales of properties in India and Europe. In 2014, we
recorded a benefit of $84 million related to VAT-related settlements in Latin America. In 2014, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $7 million related to the sale of a property in Europe. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco on
February 22, 2013 added $3 million in incremental operating income in 2014 for the period prior to the anniversary of the acquisition.

Unfavorable currency
impacts decreased operating income by $287 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar in 2013 and 2014 and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real,
Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnya, partially offset by the strength of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar.

Operating income margin decreased
from 11.2% in 2013 to 9.5% in 2014. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the year-over-year negative impact of the benefit from the resolution of the Cadbury
acquisition-related indemnification recorded in 2013, higher costs for the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela and costs incurred related to the JDE coffee transactions, partially
offset by lower Integration Program costs. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 12.1% in 2013 to 12.9% in 2014. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by lower overhead costs from continued cost reduction
efforts and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due primarily to current year productivity initiatives, partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin due entirely to the unfavorable impact of unrealized gains / (losses) on currency
and commodity hedging activities.

Organic Net Revenue growth was
driven by favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing. Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by higher shipments across all segments except Asia Pacific. Higher net pricing in Latin America, primarily related to Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil,
and in North America was partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe, Asia Pacific and EEMEA, primarily due to lower coffee prices. Unfavorable currency decreased net revenues by $837 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan
bolivar and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Japanese yen and South African rand, partially offset by the strength of the euro relative the
U.S. dollar. The impact of divestitures resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $345 million. In addition, the acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco added $91 million in net revenues and the accounting calendar change in
Europe added $37 million in net revenues in 2013.

Represents the estimated annual benefit plan expense associated with certain benefit plan obligations transferred to Kraft Foods Group, Inc. in the Spin-Off.

Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by volume gains across all segments except Asia Pacific. Higher net pricing in Latin America and North America was partially
offset by lower net pricing in Europe, Asia Pacific and EEMEA, primarily due to lower coffee pricing. During 2013, increased input costs outpaced higher net pricing. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to
higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased $497 million from 2012, due in part to lower Spin-Off Costs, a benefit from the resolution of the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification, a favorable currency impact net of the negative impact from the devaluation of our net monetary
assets in Venezuela, gains on the sales of properties in 2013 and the impact of businesses divested in 2013 and 2012, which were partially offset by gains on sales of properties in 2012, higher Integration Program costs, higher 2012-2014
Restructuring Program costs and the inclusion of expenses related to the acquired biscuit operations in Morocco.



Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $246 million from 2012, driven
primarily by higher overhead costs in emerging markets, including investments in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion in emerging markets, the 2012 reversal of reserves carried over from the Cadbury acquisition in 2010 and no longer
required, prior-year proceeds from insurance settlements and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs in Asia Pacific, EEMEA and Latin America.

The change
in unrealized gains / (losses) added $61 million in operating income for 2013. In 2013, the net unrealized gains were $62 million, as compared to net unrealized gains of $1 million in 2012. In 2013, we recorded pre-tax gains of $68 million related
to sales of properties in India and Europe. In 2012, we recorded pre-tax gains of $77 million related to sales of properties in Russia and Turkey. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco added $16 million in operating income for 2013.
Accounting calendar changes that went into effect in Europe in the first quarter of 2013 increased operating income by $6 million.

Unfavorable currency impacts
decreased operating income by $146 million, due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, South
African rand and Russian ruble, partially offset by the strength of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar.

Operating income margin increased from 10.4% in 2012 to
11.2% in 2013. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by lower Spin-Off Costs and the benefit from the resolution of the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification, partially offset by higher costs for the 2012-2014
Restructuring Program, lower Integration Program costs, a negative impact from divestitures and the unfavorable impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela. Adjusted Operating Income margin decreased from 12.3% in 2012 to
12.1% in 2013. The decrease in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by a modest decline in gross margin, due to the timing of price increases to cover rising currency exchange transaction costs on imported raw materials in the
second half of the year, partially offset by the benefit of leverage on our selling, general and administrative expenses.

Results of Operations by Reportable Segment

Our operations and management structure are organized into five reportable operating segments:

•

Latin America

•

Asia Pacific

•

EEMEA

•

Europe

•

North America

We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing
business environments more effectively at a local level and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Beginning in 2015, within each region, we also manage by product category. In the historical periods presented and discussed
below, we managed our operations within Latin America, Asia Pacific and EEMEA by location and within Europe and North America by location and product category.

We
use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. See Note 17,

2014 compared with 2013:

Net
revenues decreased $229 million (4.3%), due to unfavorable currency (19.4 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (4.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (19.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the Venezuelan bolivar
devaluation and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Argentinean peso and Brazilian real. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven primarily by Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina, partially offset by gains in Brazil and the Western Andean
countries. Higher net pricing was reflected primarily in the higher inflationary countries of Venezuela and Argentina, as well as in Brazil and Mexico.

Segment
operating income decreased $95 million (16.7%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, unfavorable volume/mix, the year-over-year net impact from the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, costs incurred for
the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, the absence of Integration Program costs in 2014, lower other
selling, general and administrative expenses (including $84 million related primarily to VAT-related settlements) and lower 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs.

2013 compared with 2012:

Net revenues decreased $14 million (0.3%),
due to unfavorable currency (12.6 pp), mostly offset by higher net pricing (11.4 pp) and favorable volume/mix (0.9 pp). Unfavorable currency was due primarily to the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the
Brazilian real and Argentinean peso, partially offset by the strength of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar. Higher net pricing was reflected across the entire region except in Mexico. Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by Brazil,
partially offset by volume/mix declines in Argentina and Venezuela.

Segment operating income decreased $199 million (25.9%), due primarily to higher raw material
costs, unfavorable currency including the $54 million impact from the devaluation of net monetary assets in Venezuela, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including prior-year proceeds from an insurance settlement), higher
manufacturing costs, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing and lower Spin-Off Costs.

2014 compared with 2013:

Net
revenues decreased $347 million (7.0%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (5.7 pp) and unfavorable currency (4.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.9 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was driven primarily by China, Australia/New Zealand,
Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, partially offset by gains in India. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah and Japanese yen.
Higher net pricing was primarily due to India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia/New Zealand and China.

Segment operating income decreased $127 million
(24.8%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix, an intangible asset impairment charge related to a biscuit trademark, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs and unfavorable
currency. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, the absence of Integration Program costs in 2014 and lower other selling, general and
administrative expenses (including an unfavorable year-over-year impact from the 2013 gain on a sale of property in India).

2013 compared with 2012:

Net revenues decreased $212 million (4.1%), due to unfavorable currency (4.7 pp) and lower net pricing (1.9 pp) partially offset by favorable volume/mix
(2.5 pp). Unfavorable currency was due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Indian rupee and Japanese yen. Lower net pricing was reflected in the region’s developed markets, partially offset by higher
net pricing in the region’s emerging markets, primarily in India, the Philippines and Thailand. Favorable volume/mix was driven by the region’s emerging markets, primarily India, China, the Philippines and Malaysia, as well as in the
region’s developed markets of Australia/New Zealand.

Segment operating income decreased $145 million (22.1%), due primarily to higher raw material costs,
lower net pricing, unfavorable currency, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including investments in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion, the impacts of a gain on sale of property in India and prior-year proceeds
from an insurance settlement) and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs, a 2012 asset impairment charge related to a trademark in Japan, lower Spin-Off Costs and
favorable volume/mix.

2014 compared with 2013:

Net
revenues decreased $277 million (7.1%), due to unfavorable currency (13.4 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.5 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (5.7 pp), favorable volume/mix (0.8 pp) and the impact of the February 2013 acquisition of
a biscuit operation in Morocco (0.3 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, primarily the Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnya, South African rand and Turkish lira.
Divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in a $20 million decline in net revenues. Higher net pricing was reflected across most of the segment, primarily in Russia, Ukraine and Turkey. Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by Russia, the Gulf
Cooperation Council (“GCC”) countries and Turkey. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco in February 2013 added $14 million in incremental net revenues for 2014 for the period prior to the anniversary date of the acquisition.

Segment operating income decreased $52 million (13.7%), due primarily to higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program
costs, costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and costs associated with the JDE coffee transactions. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, lower Integration Program and other
acquisition integration costs, favorable volume/mix, the impact of 2013 divestitures and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs.

2013 compared with
2012:

Net revenues increased $180 million (4.8%), due to favorable volume/mix (11.0 pp) and the impact of the acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco
(2.5 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (4.7 pp), the impact of divestitures in Turkey and South Africa (2.2 pp) and lower net pricing (1.8 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by Russia, Ukraine, Egypt, West Africa, Central and
East Africa and South Africa. Unfavorable currency was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the South African rand, Russian ruble and Egyptian pound. Lower net pricing was reflected primarily in
Russia and Ukraine, due to lower coffee and chocolate pricing, partially offset by higher net pricing in the GCC countries, South Africa and Egypt.

Segment
operating income decreased $127 million (25.1%), due primarily to higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including investments in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion and a write-off of a $15 million VAT receivable
that is no longer realizable), the 2012 gains on the sales of property in Russia and Turkey, lower net pricing, higher raw material costs, higher Integration Program and Morocco biscuit acquisition integration costs, unfavorable currency, higher
advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs and the impact of divestitures in Turkey and South Africa. These unfavorable items were partially offset by favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs and
the impact from the acquisition in Morocco.

2014 compared with 2013:

Net
revenues decreased $147 million (1.0%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (2.3 pp), the impact of the prior year’s accounting calendar change (0.2 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.0 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (1.3 pp) and
favorable currency (0.2 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by lower shipments across all categories. The decline was due to pricing-related elasticity across the region and certain pricing-related customer disruptions. The accounting calendar
change made in 2013 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $38 million. In addition, divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in an $11 million decline in net revenues. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate and
cheese & grocery, partially offset by lower net pricing in all other categories, primarily biscuits and coffee. Favorable currency impacts primarily reflected the strength of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar, partially
offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar against the Swedish krona, the euro and Norwegian krone.

Segment operating income increased $71 million (4.2%), due
primarily to lower manufacturing costs, higher net pricing, lower Integration Program costs (including the reversal of a prior-year accrual), lower advertising and consumer promotion costs and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses
(net of the unfavorable year-over-year impact from the 2013 gains on the sales of property in the United Kingdom, Norway and Italy, and the benefit from a 2014 gain on a sale of property in the United Kingdom). These favorable items were partially
offset by higher raw material costs (primarily higher cocoa costs), costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, unfavorable volume mix, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, costs associated with the JDE coffee transactions, an
intangible asset impairment charge related to a candy trademark and the year-over-year impact from last year’s accounting calendar change.

2013 compared
with 2012:

Net revenues increased $242 million (1.8%), due to favorable volume/mix (3.2 pp), favorable currency (2.1 pp) and the impact of an accounting
calendar change (0.3 pp), partially offset by lower pricing (2.4 pp) and the impact of current and prior-year divestitures (1.4 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven by higher shipments in chocolate, biscuits and coffee, partially offset by lower
shipments in gum & candy and cheese & grocery. Favorable currency primarily reflected the strength of the euro, Swedish krona and Polish zloty relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar
relative to the British pound sterling. Lower net pricing was driven primarily by lower coffee prices.

Segment operating income decreased $63 million (3.6%), due
primarily to lower net pricing, higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, the impact of current and prior-year divestitures and higher Integration Program costs (partially due to the reversal of $45 million of charges due to the outcome of labor
negotiations in April 2012). These unfavorable items were partially offset by favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs, favorable currency, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including the impacts of gains on the sales
of property in the United Kingdom, Norway and Italy and a $44 million reversal in 2012 of reserves carried over from the Cadbury acquisition in 2010 no longer required), lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact of an accounting
calendar change and lower raw material costs (primarily coffee).

Net
revenues decreased $55 million (0.8%), due to unfavorable currency (1.0 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.6 pp), partially offset by favorable volume/mix (0.7 pp) and higher net pricing (0.1 pp). Unfavorable currency impact was due to the
strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in a $39 million decline in net revenues. Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by higher shipments in biscuits, partially offset by lower
shipments in gum. Higher net pricing was reflected primarily in biscuits and gum, partially offset by lower net pricing in chocolate.

Segment operating income
increased $33 million (3.7%), due primarily to lower raw material costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, favorable volume/mix, lower 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs and
higher net pricing. These favorable items were partially offset by costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, higher manufacturing costs and the impact of divestitures.

2013 compared with 2012:

Net revenues increased $88 million (1.3%),
due to favorable volume/mix (2.5 pp) and higher net pricing (0.4 pp), partially offset by the impact of current and prior-year divestitures (1.0 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by higher shipments in
biscuits and candy, partially offset by lower shipments in gum. Higher net pricing was reflected primarily in biscuits and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in gum.

Segment operating income increased $108 million (13.8%), due primarily to favorable volume/mix, lower pension expenses due to the transfer of certain benefit plan
obligations to Kraft Foods Group, Inc. in the Spin-Off, higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs (including a reversal of some prior-year accruals), lower Spin-Off Costs and lower Integration
Program costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, higher raw material costs, and the impact of a current and prior-year divestitures.



Critical Accounting Estimates

We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates,
judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates
and assumptions. Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have
discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.

Goodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets

:

We test goodwill and
non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors
affecting the reporting units with goodwill. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect
to do quantitative testing instead. Quantitative impairment testing consists of a two-step evaluation. The first step compares a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using
a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for reporting units in our Europe and North America segments, we used a market-based, weighted-average
cost of capital of 6.9% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America, Asia Pacific and EEMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.9%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units
requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair
value, we apply the second step to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to
the implied fair value of the goodwill.

On January 1, 2014, an organizational change occurred within our North America region from a country and product
category structure to a regional product category structure. As a result, our North America region now has two instead of four reporting units. For any reporting units that were reorganized, the goodwill was allocated to the new reporting unit
structure based on relative fair values of the related business units.

In 2014, 2013 and 2012, all reporting units passed our annual goodwill impairment testing.
If expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in
the future.

We test non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect
the fair value or carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value.
Estimated fair value is determined using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced
to the estimated fair value.

During our 2014 review of non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded $57 million of impairment charges related to two
trademarks. In both cases, the impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth and decisions made in the fourth quarter to redirect support for the products to other regional brands. We recorded a $48 million charge related to a
biscuit trademark in our Asia Pacific segment and a $9 million charge related to a candy trademark in our Europe segment. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible
assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method, which utilizes estimates of future sales, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a
brand’s global fair value. During our 2014 intangible asset impairment review, we also noted three brands with $341 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2014 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or
less. While these intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired, if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of
our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future.

Refer also to Note 5,

Goodwill and
Intangible Assets

, for additional information.



Trade and marketing programs:

We promote our products with advertising, marketing, sales incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperative advertising,
in-store displays, consumer promotions, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives. We expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Sales incentive and
trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim
reporting purposes, advertising expenses and sales incentives are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all
marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.

Employee Benefit Plans:

We sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world. These include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we
estimate the pension and post-retirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement
age and mortality (during 2014, we applied the new mortality tables in accounting for our U.S. pension plans); and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on
current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized
for the underlying plans.

As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. The cost or benefit of
plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive
benefits.

Since pension and post-retirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and
expenses. The expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses, since many of our pension plans are partially funded. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these
assumptions are described in Note 10,

Benefit Plans

, to the consolidated financial statements.

While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2015
assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a

fifty-basis

point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets
would have the following effects, increase / (decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs:

Income Taxes:

As a global company, we
calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable in the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax
positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction
and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.



Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the
years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax
positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used
to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from
estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which
the determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions.

No taxes
have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, such as material changes in long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional
provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.

Commodity Trends

We regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for
production. During 2014, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were increased cocoa, dairy, packaging, energy and coffee bean costs and higher currency-related costs on our commodity purchases, partially offset by
lower costs for sugar and grains and oils due primarily to hedging.

A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency
fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through
hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes,
and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. We generally also price to protect gross profit dollars. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, or other factors,
our pricing actions may lag commodity cost changes temporarily.

We expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2015.
While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe that cash from operations, our $4.5 billion revolving credit facility and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our
working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. We expect to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our debt. We continue to utilize our
commercial paper program, primarily uncommitted international credit lines and long-term debt issuances for regular funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall,
we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, including the indefinite reinvestment of our earnings outside of the United States. In Venezuela, we consider all undistributed earnings
to be indefinitely reinvested and access to cash of $278 million in Venezuela to be limited due to the uncertain economic and political environment. We do not expect this limitation to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Refer to Note
1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting

, for additional information.

The cash flow
activity of the Kraft Foods Group, Inc. discontinued operation, which was divested on October 1, 2012, is included within our consolidated cash flow results for periods prior to October 1, 2012.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:

Operating activities provided net
cash of $3,562 million in 2014, $6,410 million in 2013 and $3,923 million in 2012. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2014 relative to 2013 was primarily related to our receipt of $2.6 billion of net cash from the resolution of the Starbucks
arbitration in 2013 and higher related income taxes paid in 2014 and lower relative working capital cash improvements than in 2013, as we decreased our cash conversion cycle (a metric that measures working capital efficiency and utilizes days sales
outstanding, days inventory on hand and days payables outstanding) by 10 days in 2014 as compared to a 13 day reduction in 2013. These year-over-year decreases were partially offset by lower interest payments in 2014 following the debt refinancing
in the first quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in operating cash flows in 2013 relative to 2012 was primarily related to the receipt of the $2.6 billion from the Starbucks arbitration resolution, lower spending on Spin-Off
Costs and the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, lengthening of days payables outstanding, increased collection of receivables and lower interest payments.

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities:

Net cash used in investing activities was $1,642 million in 2014, $1,483 million in 2013 and $1,687 million in 2012. The
increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 relates to lower cash inflows in 2014 to offset higher capital expenditures in 2014. In 2013, we received higher cash proceeds from property sales, net proceeds from divestitures and cash
from Kraft Foods Group, Inc. in connection with the Spin-Off, partially offset by cash we paid for an acquisition in Morocco. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2013 relative to 2012 related to payments made to Kraft Foods
Group, Inc. in 2012 in connection with the Spin-Off, partially offset by cash we paid for the acquisition in Morocco and lower proceeds from divestitures in 2013.

Capital expenditures were $1,642 million in 2014, $1,622 million in 2013 and $1,610 million in 2012. The 2014 capital expenditures were funded from operating activities
and were made primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to be up to $1.8 billion, including capital expenditures required for investments in systems and
the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations.

Net Cash (Used in) / Provided by Financing Activities:

Net cash used in or provided by financing activities was $2,688 million used in 2014, $6,687 million used in 2013 and $204 million provided in 2012. The
decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2014 relative to 2013 was primarily due to significantly lower long-term debt repayments and lower share repurchases in 2014, offset in part by decreased proceeds from the issuance of long-term
debt and other short-term borrowings and higher dividend payments in 2014. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2013 relative to 2012 was primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, higher
re-payment of long-term debt and repurchases of Common Stock, partially offset by lower dividend payments reflecting our new capital structure and dividend rate following the Spin-Off and higher short-term borrowings.



Debt:

From time to time we
refinance long-term and short-term debt. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other
factors. Generally, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The third and fourth quarters of the year typically generate higher cash flows. As such,
we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital needs.

In February 2014, our Board of
Directors approved a $5 billion long-term financing authority that remains available as of December 31, 2014.

In the next 12 months, $1,513 million of
long-term debt will mature as follows: $1,029 million in March 2015 and

€

400 million ($484 million as of December 31, 2014) in June 2015. We expect to fund these repayments with cash
from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or additional debt.

Our total debt was $16.7 billion at December 31, 2014 and $17.1 billion at
December 31, 2013. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.38 at December 31, 2014 and 0.35 at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 7.7 years. Our average daily
commercial borrowings were $1.9 billion in 2014, $1.0 billion in 2013 and $1.0 billion in 2012. We expect to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to Note 8,

Debt and Borrowing Arrangements

, for more information on our
debt and debt covenants.

Equity and Dividends

Stock Plans:

See Note 12,

Stock Plans

, to the consolidated financial
statements for more information on our stock plans, grant activity during 2014, 2013 and 2012, and stock award modifications related to the Spin-Off.

Share
Repurchases:

See Note 13,

Capital Stock

, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase and accelerated share
repurchase programs.

We intend to continue to use a portion of our cash for share repurchases. Under our current Board of Directors’ authorization to
repurchase up to $7.7 billion of our Common Stock through December 31, 2016, we have repurchased $4.6 billion ($1.9 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013) of shares, with $3.1 billion of share repurchase capacity remaining. The number of
shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other
demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or
discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice.

Dividends:

We paid dividends of $964 million in 2014, $943 million in 2013 and $2,058 million in 2012. Immediately following the Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. on
October 1, 2012, our annual dividend rate changed to $0.52 per common share. On August 6, 2013, our Audit Committee, with authorization from our Board of Directors, approved an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.14 per common
share or $0.56 per common share on an annual basis. On August 5, 2014, our Audit Committee, with authorization from our Board of Directors, approved a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per common share or $0.60 per common share on
an annual basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our
Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below.

Guarantees:

As discussed in Note 11,

Commitments and
Contingencies

, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At
December 31, 2014, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.

In addition, at December 31, 2014, we
were contingently liable for $743 million of guarantees related to our own performance. These include letters of credit and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes.

Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.

Aggregate Contractual Obligations:

contractual obligations at December 31, 2014.

Amounts include the expected cash payments of our long-term debt excluding capital leases, which are presented separately in the table above. The amounts also exclude $(10) million of net unamortized non-cash bond
premiums and discounts and mark-to-market adjustments related to our interest rate swaps recorded in total debt.

(2)

Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our euro and British pound sterling notes were forecasted using currency exchange rates as of
December 31, 2014. An insignificant amount of interest expense was excluded from the table for a portion of our other non-U.S. debt obligations due to the complexities involved in forecasting expected interest payments.

(3)

Operating lease payments represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.

(4)

Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to
be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a
contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice
(usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.

(5)

Other long-term liabilities include estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2024 of $203 million. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the
payments beyond 2024; as such, they are excluded from the above table. There are also another $280 million of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next 5 years. In addition, the following long-term liabilities
included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, income taxes, insurance accruals and other accruals. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments (or contributions beyond 2015, in
the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. We currently expect to make approximately $529 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2015. We also expect that our net pension cost will increase to approximately $321 million in 2015.
The increase is primarily due to lower discount rates offset by favorable beginning of the year asset levels and planned contributions. As of December 31, 2014, our total liability for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions and
associated accrued interest and penalties, was $1,041 million. We currently estimate payments of approximately $133 million related to these positions over the next 12 months.



Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating
results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our
performance. We disclose non-GAAP financial measures so that you have the same financial data that we use to assist you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance.

Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could
change over time:

•

“Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures (including businesses under sale agreements and exits of major product lines under a sale or licensing
agreement), Integration Program costs, accounting calendar changes and currency rate fluctuations.

•

“Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income excluding the impact of Spin-Off Costs, pension costs related to obligations transferred in the Spin-Off, the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the
2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs, the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, the benefit from the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution, incremental costs
associated with the JDE coffee transactions, impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, gains or losses on divestitures or acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and the operating results of divestitures (including businesses
under sale agreements and exits of major product lines under a sale or licensing agreement). We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis.

•

“Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impact of Spin-Off Costs, pension costs related to the obligations transferred in
the Spin-Off, the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs, the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, the net benefit from the Cadbury
acquisition-related indemnification resolution, losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, the residual tax benefit impact from the resolution of the Starbucks arbitration, hedging gains or losses and incremental costs associated with the
JDE coffee transactions, impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, gains or losses on divestitures or acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and net earnings from divestitures (including businesses under sale agreements and
exits of major product lines under a sale or licensing agreement), and including an interest expense adjustment related to the Spin-Off transaction. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis.

We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the
corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures may vary among other
companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by
evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K.



Organic Net Revenue

Applying
the definition of “Organic Net Revenue”, the adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, divestitures, an accounting calendar change in 2013 and
acquisitions. We believe that Organic Net Revenue better reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results.

were to exclude Spin-Off Costs, 2012 pension costs related to the obligations transferred in the Spin-Off, 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs, the Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs,
the benefit from the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution, the remeasurement of net monetary assets in Venezuela, impairment charges related to intangible assets, incremental costs associated with the JDE coffee transactions, net
gains on an acquisition and divestitures, acquisition-related costs and operating income from divestitures. We also evaluate Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis. We believe these measures provide improved comparability of
operating results.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as
part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results.
We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative
activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 9,

Financial Instruments

.

Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported
results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of
our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects
our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and
other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See

Consolidated Results of Operations

and

Results of Operations by
Reportable Segment

under

Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results

for currency exchange effects on our financial results during 2014. For additional information on the impact of currency policies and the remeasurement of our
Venezuelan net monetary assets on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting

.

We also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions,
government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions. To manage the input cost volatility, we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take
pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.

We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current
and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”), Euro Interbank Offered Rate
(“EURIBOR”) and commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. In
addition to using interest rate derivatives to manage future interest payments, earlier this year and in the fourth quarter of 2013, we also retired $5 billion of our long-term debt and issued $6.3 billion of lower borrowing cost debt. Our
weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2014 was 4.3%, down from 4.8% as of December 31, 2013.

Value at Risk:

We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments;
and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity

price-sensitive

derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed
income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during 2014. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity
forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the abovementioned instruments are intended
to hedge.

The VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique
was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the
expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange, and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and over each of the four prior
quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.



As of December 31, 2014, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive
instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were:

This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the specified
confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it
consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual
impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results.



Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Mondelēz International, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, equity and cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mondelēz International, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) because a material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting related to the ineffective monitoring and oversight of controls over income tax accounting existed as of that date. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control
over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness referred to above is
described in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered this material weakness in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2014
consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements. The Company’s management is
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management’s report referred to
above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Mondelēz International, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Mondelēz International,
Inc. (formerly Kraft Foods Inc.) was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Mondelēz International, Inc., through its subsidiaries (collectively “Mondelēz International,” “we,” “us” and
“our”), sells food and beverage products to consumers in approximately 165 countries.

Discontinued Operation:

On October 1, 2012 (the “Distribution Date”), we completed the spin-off of our former North American grocery business, Kraft Foods Group, Inc.
(“Kraft Foods Group”), by distributing 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Kraft Foods Group to holders of our Common Stock (the “Spin-Off”). We retained our global snacks business along with other food and beverage
categories. The divested Kraft Foods Group business is presented as a discontinued operation on the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented. The Kraft Foods Group other comprehensive earnings, changes in equity and cash flows
are included within our consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings, equity and cash flows through October 1, 2012. See Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions,

for additional information.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include
Mondelēz International, Inc. as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. We account for investments in which we exercise significant influence (20%-50% ownership interest) under the equity method of accounting. We use the cost
method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20% and in which we do not exercise significant influence. The noncontrolling interest represents the non-controlling investors’ interests in the results
of subsidiaries that we control and consolidate. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.

Accounting Calendar Change:

In connection with moving toward a common consolidation date across the Company, in the first quarter of 2013, we changed the consolidation date for our Europe segment,
from predominantly the last Saturday of each period to the last calendar day of each period. The change had a favorable impact of $37 million on net revenues and $6 million on operating income in 2013.

At this time, the majority of our operating subsidiaries report results as of the last calendar day of the period except for our North America segment. The North
America segment reported results as of the last Saturday of the period and beginning in the first quarter of 2015, reports results as of the last calendar day of the period.

We believe these changes to a common consolidation date are preferable and will improve business planning and financial reporting by better matching the close dates of
the operating subsidiaries and bringing the reporting dates closer to the period-end date. As the effect to prior-period results was not material, we have not revised the prior-period results.

Use of Estimates:

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, pension and benefit plan assumptions, valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, restructuring program
liabilities, marketing program accruals, insurance and self-insurance reserves and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include
the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our
consolidated financial statements.

Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting:

We translate the results of operations of our subsidiaries from multiple currencies using average exchange rates during each period and translate balance sheet accounts
using exchange rates at the end of each period. We record currency translation adjustments as a component of equity and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings.



Venezuela.

As prescribed by U.S. GAAP for highly inflationary economies, we have been accounting for the results of
our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency since January 1, 2010.

On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government
announced the devaluation of the official Venezuelan bolivar exchange rate from 4.30 bolivars to 6.30 bolivars to the U.S. dollar and the elimination of the second-tier, government-regulated SITME exchange rate previously applied to value certain
types of transactions. In connection with the announced changes, we recorded a $54 million currency remeasurement loss related to the devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela within selling, general and administrative expenses in our
Latin America segment during the three months ended March 31, 2013.

On January 24, 2014, the Venezuelan government announced the expansion of the
auction-based currency transaction program referred to as SICAD or SICAD I and new profit margin controls. The application of the SICAD I rate was extended to include foreign investments and significant operating activities, including contracts for
leasing and services, use and exploitation of patents and trademarks, payments of royalties and contracts for technology import and technical assistance. As of December 31, 2014, the SICAD I exchange rate for the food segment auctions in which
we participate was 11.50 bolivars to the U.S. dollar.

Additionally, on March 24, 2014, the Venezuelan government launched a new market-based currency exchange
market, SICAD II. SICAD II may be used voluntarily to exchange bolivars into U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2014, the SICAD II exchange rate was 49.99 bolivars to the U.S. dollar.

Our Venezuelan operations produce a wide range of biscuit, cheese & grocery, confectionery and beverage products. Based on the currency exchange developments
this year, we reviewed our domestic and international sourcing of goods and services and the exchange rates we believe will be applicable. We evaluated the level of primarily raw material imports that we believe would continue to be sourced in
exchange for U.S. dollars converted at the official 6.30 exchange rate. Our remaining imported goods and services would primarily be valued at the SICAD I exchange rate. Imports that do not currently qualify for either the official rate or SICAD I
rate may be sourced at the SICAD II rate.

We believe the SICAD I rate is the most appropriate rate to use as it is most representative of the various exchange
rates at which U.S. dollars are currently available to our entire Venezuelan business. While some of our net monetary assets or liabilities qualify for settlement at the official exchange rate, other operations do not, and we have utilized both the
SICAD I and SICAD II auction processes. In addition, there is significant uncertainty about our ability to secure approval for transactions and the limited availability of U.S. dollars offered at the official rate. As such, we believe it is more
economically representative to use the SICAD I rate than the official rate to value our net monetary assets and translate future operating results.

As of
March 31, 2014, we began to apply the SICAD I exchange rate to remeasure our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets, and we began translating our Venezuelan operating results at the new rate in the second quarter of 2014. On March 31,
2014, we recognized a $142 million currency remeasurement loss within selling, general and administrative expenses of our Latin America segment as a result of revaluing our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets from the official exchange rate of
6.30 bolivars to the U.S. dollar to the then-prevailing SICAD I exchange rate of 10.70 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2014, the SICAD I exchange rate for the food segment auctions in which we participate was 11.50 bolivars to
the U.S. dollar. Through December 31, 2014, we recognized $25 million of additional remeasurement charges related primarily to changes in the SICAD I rate.

The following table sets forth net revenues for our Venezuelan operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 (measured at the 6.30 official rate in the first
quarter and at the SICAD I rate subsequent to the March 31, 2014 remeasurement), and cash, net monetary assets and net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 (translated at the SICAD I last exchange rate for food
segment auctions in which we participate, which was 11.50 bolivars to the U.S. dollar):

Most recently, on February 10, 2015, the Venezuelan government announced changes in the currency exchange structure.
While retaining the 6.30 official rate for food and other essentials and the SICAD I offered rate based on recently cleared auction transactions for specific sectors of the economy, the SICAD II exchange rate is expected to be replaced with a new
market-based SIMADI rate. We will continue to monitor developments related to this currency structure. At this time, we continue to expect to use the SICAD I rate to remeasure our net monetary assets in Venezuela. A change in the SICAD I rate from
11.50 (our last SICAD I auction rate realized in 2014) to 12.00 (the opening SICAD I rate announced on February 10, 2015) would result in approximately a $10 million remeasurement loss based on our net monetary assets in Venezuela as of
December 31, 2014. Depending on the SICAD I auctions that occur through March, 31, 2015, however, the amount of the remeasurement loss recorded in the first quarter of 2015 could change.

Unlike the official rate that is fixed at 6.30 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, the SICAD I rate is expected to vary over time. If any of the three-tier currency exchange
rates, or the application of the rates to our business, were to change, we may recognize additional currency losses, or gains, which could be significant.

In light
of the ongoing difficult macroeconomic environment in Venezuela, we continue to monitor and actively manage our investment and exposures in Venezuela. We plan to continue to do business in the country as long as we can successfully continue to
operate our local business there. We strive to locally source and produce a significant amount of the products we sell in Venezuela. We have taken other protective measures against currency devaluation, such as converting monetary assets into
non-monetary assets that we can use in our business. However, suitable protective measures have become less available and more expensive and may not offset further currency devaluation that could occur.

Argentina.

On January 23, 2014, the Central Bank of Argentina adjusted its currency policy, removed its currency stabilization measures and allowed the
Argentine peso exchange rate to float relative to the U.S. dollar. On that day, the value of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar fell by 15%, and from December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2014, the value of the peso declined
31%. In July 2014, Argentina had a technical default on its debt as the government was blocked from making payments on its restructured debt by certain creditors who did not participate in a debt restructuring in 2001. Based on the current state of
the Argentine economy and its restricted liquidity, access to capital, currency rules and regulations, the business operating environment remains challenging. Further volatility and declines in the exchange rate are expected. We continue to monitor
and actively manage our investment and exposures in Argentina. We continue refining our product portfolio to improve our product offerings, mix and profitability. We also continue to implement additional cost initiatives to protect the business.
Further currency declines, economic controls or other business restrictions could have an adverse impact on our ongoing results of operations. Our Argentinian operations contributed approximately $693 million, or 2.0% of consolidated net revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the net monetary liabilities of our Argentina operations were not material and they could change over time. Argentina is not designated as a highly-inflationary economy for
accounting purposes and so we continue to record currency translation adjustments within equity and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings.

Russia.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, the value of the Russian ruble relative to the U.S. dollar declined 50%, and further volatility in the currency is
expected. Russia continues to be a key market for us. We continue to take actions to protect our near-term operating results, financial condition and cash flow. Our operations in Russia contributed approximately $1,114 million, or 3.3% of
consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the net monetary assets of our Russia operations were not material and they could change over time. Russia is not designated as a highly-inflationary
economy for accounting purposes and so we continue to record currency translation adjustments within equity and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings.

Ukraine.

On February 5, 2015, the National Bank of Ukraine changed its currency policy by eliminating daily auctions, which effectively supported the
exchange rate, and allowed the Ukrainian hryvnya exchange rate to float relative to the U.S. dollar. The value of the Ukrainian hryvnya relative to the U.S. dollar declined 61%, from the beginning of the year through February 11, 2015, and
further volatility in the currency is expected. Ukraine is an important emerging market and we continue to take actions to protect our near-term operating results, cash flow and financial condition. Our Ukrainian operations contributed approximately
$294 million, or 0.9% of consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the net monetary assets of our Ukrainian operations were not material and they could change over time. Ukraine is not
designated as a highly-inflationary economy for accounting purposes and so we continue to record currency translation adjustments within equity and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits
with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.



Inventories:

We value our
inventory using the average cost method. We also record inventory allowances for overstock and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes.

Long-Lived Assets:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical
cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 20 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to
40 years.

We review long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for realizability on an ongoing basis. Changes in depreciation, generally
accelerated depreciation, are determined and recorded when estimates of the remaining useful lives or residual values of long-term assets change. We also review for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may
not be fully recoverable. In those circumstances, we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for asset impairment, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows
are separately identifiable. Any impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value. Fair value is estimated based on the undiscounted cash flows for the asset group over the remaining useful
life or based on the expected cash proceeds for the asset less costs of disposal. Any significant impairment losses would be recorded within asset impairment and exit costs in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Software Costs:

We capitalize certain computer software and software
development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
of the software, which do not exceed seven years.

Goodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets:

We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on October 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by
performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting the reporting units with goodwill. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing or elect to do quantitative testing instead, depending on
prior test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations. In the event that significant potential goodwill impairment risk exists for a specific reporting unit, we apply a two-step quantitative test.
The first step compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates
and estimates of residual value. This year, for reporting units in our Europe and North America segments, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.9% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin
America, Asia Pacific and EEMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.9%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic
conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we apply the second step to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied
fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the implied fair value of the goodwill.

We test non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or
carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine
estimated fair value using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, we consider the asset impaired and reduce its carrying value to the estimated
fair value. We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and evaluate them for impairment as we do other long-lived assets.

Insurance and Self-Insurance:

We use a combination of insurance and
self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and our obligation for employee healthcare benefits. We estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an
undiscounted basis by evaluating and making judgments about historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions and the estimated impact on future results.



Revenue Recognition:

We
recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods. Revenues are recorded net of sales incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to
customers. Our shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. Provisions for product returns and other trade allowances are also recorded as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized.

Marketing and Research and Development:

We promote our products with
advertising, marketing, sales incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperative advertising, in-store displays, consumer promotions, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and
volume-based incentives. We expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Sales incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to
customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising expenses and sales incentives are charged to operations as a percentage
of volume, based on estimated volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Advertising expense was $1,552 million in
2014, $1,721 million in 2013 and $1,815 million in 2012. We manage advertising and consumer promotions (marketing programs) on a combined basis. Advertising and consumer promotion costs were lower in 2014 due primarily to savings from consolidating
media providers, reductions in non-working media costs and efficiencies gained by shifting spending to lower-cost, digital media outlets and currency, while we increased our spending on our global Power Brands and maintained working media spending.
In 2013, advertising and consumer promotion costs were higher than in 2012. We expense product research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expense was $455 million in 2014, $471 million in 2013 and $462 million in 2012. We
record marketing and research and development expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses.

Employee Benefit Plans:

We provide a range of benefits to our current and retired employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits
depending upon jurisdiction, tenure, job level and other factors. Local statutory requirements govern many of the benefit plans we provide around the world. Local government plans generally cover health care benefits for retirees outside the United
States, Canada and United Kingdom. Our U.S., Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries provide health care and other benefits to most retired employees. Our postemployment benefit plans provide primarily severance benefits for eligible salaried and certain
hourly employees. The cost for these plans is recognized in earnings primarily over the working life of the covered employee.

Financial Instruments:

We use financial instruments to manage our currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall
risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. A principal objective of our risk
management strategies is to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates, principally through the use of derivative instruments.

We use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to
manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 9,

Financial Instruments

, to the consolidated financial statements for more
information on the types of derivative instruments we use.

We record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis and at fair value in our consolidated
balance sheets within other current assets or other current liabilities due to their relatively short-term duration. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the
derivative instrument. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) and reclassified to
earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair
value hedge, along with the changes in the fair value of the related hedged asset or liability, are recorded in earnings in the same period. We use non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations
against adverse movements in exchange rates, with currency movements related to the debt and net investment and the related deferred taxes recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses).



In order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and
the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for
undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified,
and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.

When we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its
performance obligations under the contract. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the
financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association
master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange rates or interest rates. We manage derivative
market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.

Commodity cash flow hedges

– We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We
enter into commodity forward contracts primarily for cocoa, wheat, coffee, soybean and vegetable oils, and sugar and other sweeteners. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments
and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including energy costs, coffee, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, soybean and vegetable oils, cocoa
and dairy. Some of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a
commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Currency exchange
cash flow hedges

– We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from

third-party

and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. These instruments
may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling and Canadian
dollar.

Interest rate cash flow and fair value hedges

– We manage interest rate volatility by modifying the pricing or maturity characteristics of
certain liabilities so that the net impact on expense is not, on a material basis, adversely affected by movements in interest rates. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value.
We expect the effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation to be substantially offset by our gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to these hedged liabilities. We use derivative instruments, including interest rate
swaps that have indices related to the pricing of specific liabilities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. As a matter of policy, we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments for interest rate risk management. We use
interest rate swaps to economically convert a portion of our fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. Under the interest rate swap contracts, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and
floating-rate interest amounts, which is calculated based on an agreed-upon notional amount. We also use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our future debt obligations. Substantially all of
these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

Hedges of net investments in non-U.S. operations

– We
have numerous investments outside the United States. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to changes and volatility in currency exchange rates. We use local currency denominated debt to hedge our non-U.S. net investments against adverse
movements in exchange rates. We designated our euro and pound sterling denominated borrowings as a net investment hedge of a portion of our overall European operations. The gains and losses on our net investment in these designated European
operations are economically offset by losses and gains on our euro and pound sterling denominated borrowings. The change in the debt’s value, net of deferred taxes, is recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated
other comprehensive earnings / (losses).



Income Taxes:

We recognize tax
benefits in our financial statements when uncertain tax positions are assessed more likely than not to be sustained upon audit. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being
realized upon ultimate settlement.

We recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

New Accounting Pronouncements:

In November 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standards update (“ASU”) to clarify how current guidance should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument
that is issued in the form of a share. The ASU emphasizes that an entity should consider all relevant terms and features, including the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation, in evaluating the nature of the host
contract. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the new standard on January 1, 2016 and the standard is not expected to have a material impact
on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2014, the FASB issued an ASU to clarify the accounting for certain stock-based compensation grants in which a
performance target can be achieved after a requisite service period is completed. Under this new guidance, entities are required to treat performance targets that affect vesting, and could be achieved after the requisite service period, as a
performance condition. The performance targets are not reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the grants. Compensation cost is recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and
should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining
unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the
new standard on January 1, 2016 and the standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB
issued an ASU on revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The new ASU outlines a new, single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature,
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from customer contracts, including significant judgments made in recognizing revenue. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early
adoption prohibited. The ASU may be applied retrospectively to historical periods presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We plan to adopt the new standard on the January 1, 2017 effective date and are
currently assessing the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2014, the FASB issued an ASU on the reporting of discontinued
operations. The guidance changed the definition of a discontinued operation to include dispositions that represent a strategic shift and have a major effect on operations and financial results. Strategic shifts may include the disposal of operations
in a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major investment accounted for under the equity method or other major parts of an entity. For disposals that qualify, additional disclosures, including cash flow and balance sheet information
for the discontinued operation, will be required. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted. We will apply these provisions to prospective
divestitures beginning in 2015. Refer to Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions—Planned Coffee Business Transactions

, on our plans to report the 2015 planned coffee business transactions.

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts previously reported have been
reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. At December 31, 2014, we elected to net certain regional banking activity with a legal right of offset and have reflected the change in the prior periods presented in the consolidated
statements of cash flows and prior-year cash, debt and weighted-average interest rates on our debt. During 2014, we realigned some of our products across our product categories. As a result, we have reclassified prior year product category revenues
in Note 17,

Segment Reporting,

on a consistent basis. We have adjusted the presentation of certain commodity contracts in our economic hedge table to remove the impact of intercompany sales related to forward contracts for which we have taken
physical delivery. We have reflected the change in the prior periods presented in Note 9,

Financial Instruments—Economic Hedges

, on a consistent basis. We have also provided greater detail on prior-year receivables and deferred taxes
consistent with the current year presentation.



Note 2. Divestitures and Acquisitions

Planned Coffee Business Transactions:

On May 7,
2014, we announced that we entered into an agreement to combine our wholly owned coffee portfolio (outside of France) with D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V. (“DEMB”). In conjunction with this transaction, Acorn Holdings B.V.
(“AHBV”), owner of DEMB, has also made a binding offer to receive our coffee business in France. The parties have also invited our partners in certain joint ventures to join the new company.

Upon completion of all proposed transactions, we expect to receive cash of approximately

€

4 billion and a 49
percent equity interest in the new company, to be called Jacobs Douwe Egberts (“JDE”). AHBV will hold a majority share in the proposed combined company and will have a majority of the seats on the board, which will be chaired by current
DEMB Chairman Bart Becht. We will have certain minority rights. AHBV is owned by an investor group led by JAB Holding Company s.à r.l.

Once we have
contributed our coffee businesses to the joint venture, we expect to record our interest in the joint venture as an equity method investment on our consolidated balance sheet and to include our share of its earnings prospectively within our
continuing results of operations. We also anticipate recording a gain on the divested assets of our coffee business portfolio. At this time, we do not expect the coffee business divestiture to qualify for discontinued operations presentation because
it does not represent a strategic change in our business nor is it expected to have a major effect on our results of operations as we will retain an approximate 49% interest in the combined joint venture with the DEMB business.

The transactions remain subject to regulatory approvals and the completion of employee information and consultation requirements. We continue to expect the transactions
to be completed in 2015, subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. In December 2014, the European Commission announced its intention to further evaluate the proposed transaction against EU antitrust regulations and in order to
make a final determination on merger clearance, which we currently expect in the second half of 2015. We and DEMB also continue to undertake consultations with Works Councils and employee representatives as required in connection with the
transactions.

In connection with the expected receipt of approximately

€

4 billion upon closing, we entered
into currency exchange forward contracts in the second quarter of 2014 to lock in an expected U.S. dollar value of approximately $5 billion. As of December 31, 2014, the forward contracts were recorded as derivative assets within other current
assets and through December 31, 2014, we recognized $628 million of unrealized gains related to the hedges within interest and other expense, net. On February 11, 2015, we monetized the forward contracts and recorded an additional realized
gain of $311 million in the first quarter of 2015, for a total realized gain of $939 million. We also entered into new currency exchange forward contracts to continue to lock in an expected U.S. dollar value of approximately $5 billion from the
transactions. Based on changes in the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate, the actual closing date of the planned JDE coffee transactions and the settlement dates of the hedges or other hedges we may put into place, the actual amount of U.S. dollars we
receive could change. In addition to the hedges, we have also incurred incremental expenses related to readying our coffee businesses for the planned transactions which totaled $77 million through December 31, 2014 and were recorded within
selling, general and administrative expenses of our Europe and EEMEA segments and within our general corporate expenses.

Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group:

On the Distribution Date, we completed the Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group. Each of our shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 19, 2012
(“the Record Date”) received one share of Kraft Foods Group common stock for every three shares of our Common Stock held as of the Record Date. The distribution was structured to be tax free to our U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. Following the Spin-Off, Kraft Foods Group is an independent public company and we do not beneficially own any shares of Kraft Foods Group common stock.

The divested Kraft Foods Group business is presented as a discontinued operation on the consolidated statements of earnings in 2012 when the Spin-Off occurred and, as

within our consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings, equity and cash flows through October 1, 2012.

The results of the Kraft Foods Group discontinued operation exclude certain corporate and business unit costs that were
historically allocated to Kraft Foods Group and continued at Mondelēz International after the Spin-Off. These costs include primarily corporate overheads, information systems and sales force support. On a pre-tax basis, through the date of the
Spin-Off, these costs were $150 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2012.

Interest expense relating to debt Kraft Foods Group incurred or assumed
through the Distribution Date has been included in the results from discontinued operations for all periods presented and as follows:

On the Distribution Date, we divested net assets totaling $4,358 million, or $4,111 million net of cash retained by Kraft Foods
Group. Additionally, we distributed to Kraft Foods Group $4,308 million of accumulated other comprehensive losses primarily related to the pension and other benefit plan net liabilities transferred to Kraft Foods Group and $89 million of unearned
compensation recorded within additional paid in capital. In total, we recorded a distribution of $8,755 million of retained earnings in connection with the Spin-Off.

In order to implement the Spin-Off, we entered into certain agreements with Kraft Foods Group to effect our legal and structural separation, govern the relationship
between us, and allocate various assets, liabilities and obligations between us, including, among other things, employee benefits, intellectual property and tax-related assets and liabilities (see Note 15,

Income Taxes

, for additional
information on the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities transferred or retained in the Spin-Off). In addition to executing the Spin-Off in the manner provided in the agreements, in November 2012, pursuant to these agreements, we paid
Kraft Foods Group $163 million related to targeted cash flows (together with the $247 million of cash divested on the Distribution Date, a total of $410 million of cash was transferred to Kraft Foods Group in connection with the Spin-Off). To
facilitate the management, including final payment and resolution, of certain obligations, Kraft Foods Group retained certain of our North American net trade payables and receivables.

We also retained approximately $140 million of workers’ compensation liabilities for claims incurred by Kraft Foods Group employees prior to the Spin-Off. In
November 2012, we paid Kraft Foods Group $95 million to cash settle the net trade payables and receivables. In March 2013, we collected $55 million from Kraft Foods Group related to the cash settlement of stock awards held by our respective
employees at the time of the Spin-Off as further described in Note 12,

Stock Plans

.



In 2014, we concluded our Spin-Off transition plans. Historically, we incurred Spin-Off transaction, transition and
financing and related costs (“Spin-Off Costs”) within our operating results. We have recorded Spin-Off Costs of $35 million in 2014, $62 million in 2013 and $1,053 million in 2012 in pre-tax earnings as follows:

Resolution of Starbucks Arbitration:

On
December 13, 2013, an independent arbitrator in our dispute with the Starbucks Coffee Company (“Starbucks”) issued a decision and Final Award that Kraft Foods Global, Inc. (now Kraft Foods Group), the named party in the proceeding,
had proven that it was entitled to recover and that Starbucks was required to pay $2,764 million in total cash compensation for Starbucks’ unilateral termination of the Starbucks packaged coffee business license and supply agreement. The award
included compensation for 135% of the determined fair market value of the agreement for improper termination as well as prejudgment interest of $521 million and Kraft Foods Group’s attorney’s fees, which the parties agreed would equal $15
million. Starbucks has paid all of the amount owed pursuant to the ruling. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement between Kraft Foods Group and us, Kraft Foods Group directed the recovery awarded in the arbitration proceeding to us. The
dispute arose within the Kraft Foods Group discontinued operation and was directed to Mondelēz International in connection with the Spin-Off recapitalization plans. Accordingly, the pre-tax gain on the resolution of the Starbucks arbitration of
$2.5 billion ($1.6 billion net of tax) was recorded in earnings from discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of 2013.

Acquisitions, Other Divestitures
and Sales of Property:

On November 11, 2014, we announced the pending acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam. The biscuit operation will become a
subsidiary within our Asia Pacific segment. The total consideration to be paid is expected to be up to 12,656 billion Vietnamese dong ($600 million U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2014). We expect to close the initial phase of the transaction
in mid 2015 after regulatory and other matters are resolved. We deposited $46 million in escrow upon signing the purchase agreement on November 10, 2014. We expect to pay approximately 9,935 billion Vietnamese dong ($471 million U.S. dollars as
of December 31, 2014) and deposit an additional 991 billion Vietnamese dong ($47 million U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2014) in escrow upon completing the initial phase of the transaction in mid 2015, which we expect to fund from current
borrowing capacity. The balance will be paid upon the satisfaction of final conditions, including the resolution of warranty or other claims and purchase price adjustments. Legal expenses related to the planned acquisition were $2 million in 2014
and were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.

On February 22, 2013, we acquired the remaining interest in a biscuit operation in
Morocco, which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary within our EEMEA segment. We paid net cash consideration of $119 million, consisting of $155 million purchase price net of cash acquired of $36 million. Prior to the acquisition, our interest in
the operation was accounted for under the equity method. As a result of obtaining a controlling interest, we consolidated the operation and upon finalizing the valuation of the acquired net assets, as of December 31, 2013, we had recorded the
fair value of acquired assets (including identifiable intangible assets of $48 million), the liabilities assumed and goodwill of $209 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2013, we also recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million related
to the remeasurement of our previously-held equity interest in the operation to fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and acquisition costs of $7 million in interest and other expense, net and selling, general and administrative expenses. We
recorded integration charges of $4 million in 2014 and $4 million in 2013 within cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.

In 2013, we
completed several divestitures primarily in our EEMEA and Europe segments that generated cash proceeds of $60 million and pre-tax gains of $8 million. The divestitures included a salty snacks business in Turkey, a confectionery business in South
Africa and a chocolate business in Spain.

In 2012, we completed several divestitures within our Europe segment that generated cash proceeds of $200 million and
pre-tax gains of $107 million. The divestitures primarily included a dinners and sauces grocery business in Germany and Belgium and a canned meat business in Italy.



The aggregate operating results of the 2013 and 2012 divestitures were not material to our financial statements in any of
the periods presented.

In 2013, we sold properties in India within our Asia Pacific segment and in Italy, the United Kingdom and Norway within our Europe segment.
The India property sale generated a $39 million pre-tax gain and $53 million of cash proceeds. The Europe property sales generated $29 million in pre-tax net gains and $37 million of cash proceeds. We also have a $43 million receivable related to
the United Kingdom property sale. The gains were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses and cash proceeds were recorded in cash flows from other investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2013.

In 2012, we also sold property in Russia and Turkey within our EEMEA segment. The Russia property sale generated a $55 million pre-tax gain and $72 million of cash
proceeds and the Turkey property sale generated a $22 million pre-tax gain and $29 million of cash proceeds. The gains were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses and the cash proceeds were recorded in cash flows from other
investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2012.

biscuit business of Groupe Danone S.A. and Cadbury Limited. Amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, customer-related intangibles, process
technology, licenses and non-compete agreements. At December 31, 2014, the weighted-average life of our amortizable intangible assets was 13.5 years.

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $206 million in 2014, $217 million in 2013 and $217 million in 2012. We currently estimate annual amortization expense
for each of the next five years to be approximately $200 million.

Changes to goodwill and intangible assets were:

•

Divestitures – In 2013, we reduced goodwill by $13 million and intangible assets by $7 million due to the divestitures of a chocolate business in Spain, a salty snacks business in Turkey and a confectionery
business in South Africa.

•

Acquisitions – In 2013, we increased goodwill by $209 million and intangible assets by $48 million due to the acquisition of our remaining interest in a biscuit operation in Morocco.

•

Asset Impairments – In 2014, we recorded $57 million of charges related to two trademarks as described below.



On January 1, 2014, an organizational change occurred within our North America region from a country and product
category structure to a regional product category structure. As a result, our North America region now has two instead of four reporting units. For any reporting units that were reorganized, the goodwill was allocated to the new reporting unit
structure based on relative fair values of the related business units.

In 2014, 2013 and 2012, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2014
annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our
control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.

During our 2014 review of non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded $57 million of impairment charges related to two trademarks. In both cases, the
impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth and decisions made in the fourth quarter to redirect support for the products to other regional brands. We recorded a $48 million charge related to a biscuit trademark in our Asia Pacific
segment and a $9 million charge related to a candy trademark in our Europe segment. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded
within asset impairment and exit costs. We primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method, which utilizes estimates of future sales, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value. During
our 2014 intangible asset impairment review, we also noted three brands with $341 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2014 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. While these intangible assets passed
our annual impairment testing and we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired, if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change
significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future.

Note 6. Restructuring Programs

2014-2018 Restructuring Program

On May 6, 2014, our
Board of Directors approved a $3.5 billion restructuring program, comprised of approximately $2.5 billion in cash costs and $1 billion in non-cash costs (the “2014-2018 Restructuring Program”), and up to $2.2 billion of capital
expenditures. The primary objective of the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program is to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. The program is intended primarily to cover severance as well as asset disposals and
other manufacturing-related one-time costs. We expect to incur the majority of the program’s charges in 2015 and 2016 and to complete the program by year-end 2018.

Restructuring Costs

:

We recorded restructuring charges of $274 million in
2014 within asset impairment and exit costs. The activity for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program liability for the year ended December 31, 2014 was:

for more details), non-cash asset write-downs (including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments) and other non-cash adjustments totaling $28 million in 2014. At December 31, 2014, $209 million of our net
restructuring liability was recorded within other current liabilities and $15 million was recorded within other long-term liabilities.



Implementation Costs:

Implementation costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities.
We believe the disclosure of implementation costs provides readers of our financial statements with more information on the total costs of our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. Implementation costs primarily relate to reorganizing our operations and
facilities in connection with our supply chain reinvention program and other identified productivity and cost saving initiatives. The costs include incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities, costs to terminate certain contracts and
the simplification of our information systems. Within our continuing results of operations, we recorded implementation costs of $107 million in 2014. We recorded these costs within cost of sales and general corporate expense within selling, general
and administrative expenses.

Restructuring and Implementation Costs in Operating Income:

During 2014, we recorded restructuring and implementation costs related to the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program within operating income as follows:

2012-2014 Restructuring Program

In 2012, our Board of Directors approved $1.5 billion of restructuring and related implementation costs (the “2012-2014 Restructuring Program”) reflecting
primarily severance, asset disposals and other manufacturing-related one-time costs. The primary objective of the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program was to ensure that Mondelēz International and Kraft Foods Group were each set up to operate
efficiently and execute on our respective business strategies upon separation and in the future.

Of the $1.5 billion of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, we
retained approximately $925 million and Kraft Foods Group retained the balance of the program. Through the end of 2014, we have incurred total restructuring and related implementation charges of $899 million, and we do not expect to incur any
additional charges on the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program.

Restructuring Costs:

We recorded restructuring charges of $360 million in 2014, $267 million in 2013 and $102 million in 2012 within asset impairment and exit costs. During 2014, we also
recorded out-of-period accruals for $73 million of severance ($52 million related to 2014 and $21 million related to 2013) in connection with a change in the timing of accruals for ongoing negotiations with workers’ councils and labor unions.

Benefit Plans

), non-cash asset write-downs (including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments) and other non-cash adjustments totaling $161million in 2014, $127 million
in 2013 and $33 million in 2012. At December 31, 2014, $98 million of our net restructuring liability was recorded within other current liabilities and $30 million was recorded within other long-term liabilities.

Implementation Costs:

Implementation costs related to our 2012-2014
Restructuring Program primarily relate to activities in connection with the Spin-Off such as reorganizing our operations and facilities, the discontinuance of certain product lines and incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities,
replicating our information systems infrastructure and reorganizing our sales function. We recorded these costs within cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses primarily within our Europe and North America segments.

Restructuring and Implementation Costs in Operating Income:

During 2014,
2013 and 2012, we recorded restructuring and implementation costs related to the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program within operating income as follows:

Note 7. Integration Program and Cost Savings Initiatives

Cadbury Integration Program:

As a result of our
combination with Cadbury Limited (formerly, Cadbury Plc or “Cadbury”) in 2010, we launched an integration program (the “Integration Program”) to combine the Cadbury operations with our operations and realize expected annual cost
savings of approximately $750 million by the end of 2013 and revenue synergies from investments in distribution, marketing and product development. We achieved cost savings of approximately $800 million in 2012, a year ahead of schedule, and
achieved our planned revenue synergies in 2013. Through the end of 2013, we incurred total integration charges of approximately $1.5 billion and completed incurring planned charges on the Integration Program.



We recorded reversals to the Integration Program charges of $8 million in 2014 related to accruals no longer required. We
recorded Integration Program charges of $216 million in 2013 and $185 million in 2012 in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses within our Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and EEMEA segments. Changes in the remaining
Integration Program liability during 2014 and 2013 were:

At December 31, 2014, $25 million of our net Integration Program liability was recorded within other current liabilities and
$33 million, primarily related to leased facilities no longer in use, was recorded within other long-term liabilities.

Other Integration Costs:

In connection with our acquisition of a biscuit operation in Morocco in February 2013, we recorded integration charges of $4 million in 2014 and $4 million in 2013. We
recorded these charges in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses within our EEMEA segment. See Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions,

for more information on the acquisition.

Cost Savings Initiatives:

Cost savings initiatives generally include exit,
disposal and other project costs outside of our restructuring programs, Cadbury Integration Program and our other integration program costs and consist of the following specific initiatives:

•

In 2013, we recorded a $20 million charge primarily within the segment operating income of Latin America related to severance benefits provided to terminated employees and one-time charges and within the segment
operating income of North America related to supply chain reinvention team expenses.

•

In 2012, we recorded a $21 million charge primarily within the segment operating income of Europe related to severance benefits provided to terminated employees and charges in connection with the reorganization in the
Europe and EEMEA segments.

loans include borrowings on primarily uncommitted credit lines maintained by some of our international subsidiaries to meet short-term working capital needs.

Borrowing Arrangements:

We maintain a revolving credit facility for general
corporate purposes, including for working capital purposes and to support our commercial paper program. Our $4.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility expires on October 11, 2018. The revolving credit agreement includes a
covenant that we maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity of at least $24.6 billion, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) and the cumulative effects of any changes in accounting principles. At December 31, 2014, we
met the covenant as our shareholders’ equity as defined by



the covenant was $35.1 billion. The revolving credit facility agreement also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. There are no credit rating triggers, provisions
or other financial covenants that could require us to post collateral as security. As of December 31, 2014, no amounts were drawn on the facility.

Some of our
international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet short-term working capital needs. Collectively, these credit lines amounted to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2014 and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2013.
Borrowings on these lines amounted to $204 million at December 31, 2014 and $184 million at December 31, 2013.

On December 11, 2014, £300 million of our 5.375% British pound sterling bonds matured. The bonds and accrued
interest to date were paid with cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper.

On February 19, 2014, $500 million of our 6.75% U.S. dollar notes matured.
The notes and accrued interest to date were paid with cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper.

On February 6, 2014, we completed a cash tender offer
and retired $1.56 billion of our long-term U.S. dollar debt consisting of:

•

$393 million of our 7.000% Notes due in August 2037

•

$382 million of our 6.875% Notes due in February 2038

•

$250 million of our 6.875% Notes due in January 2039

We financed the repurchase of these notes, including the payment
of accrued interest and other costs incurred, from net proceeds received from the $3.0 billion notes issuance on January 16, 2014. In connection with retiring this debt, during the first six months of 2014, we recorded a $493 million loss
on extinguishment of debt within interest expense related to the amount we paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs in earnings at the time of the debt
extinguishment. The loss on extinguishment is included in long-term debt repayments in the 2014 consolidated statement of cash flows. We also recognized $2 million in interest expense related to interest rate cash flow hedges that were deferred
in accumulated other comprehensive losses and recognized into earnings over the life of the debt. Upon extinguishing the debt, the deferred cash flow hedge amounts were recorded in earnings.



On January 16, 2014, we issued $3.0 billion of U.S. dollar notes, consisting of:

•

$334 million of our 6.125% Notes due in August 2018

•

$1,467 million of our 5.375% Notes due in February 2020

We financed the repurchase of these notes, including the payment
of accrued interest and other costs, with net proceeds received from the

€

2.4 billion notes issuance on December 11, 2013, cash on hand and commercial paper issuances. We recorded a
$608 million loss on extinguishment of debt within interest expense related to the amount we paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs in earnings at the time of
the debt extinguishment. The loss on extinguishment is included in long-term debt repayments in the 2013 consolidated statement of cash flows. We also recognized $4 million in interest expense related to interest rate cash flow hedges that were
deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses and recognized into earnings over the life of the debt. Upon extinguishing the debt, the deferred cash flow hedge amounts were recorded in earnings.

€

2.4 billion of Euro notes, or approximately $3.3 billion in U.S. dollars as
of December 31, 2013, consisting of:

•

€

400 million (or $550 million) of floating rate notes that bear interest at three-month EURIBOR plus 0.50% and mature on June 11, 2015

•

€

750 million (or $1,031 million) of 1.125% fixed rate notes that mature on January 26, 2017

•

€

1,250 million (or $1,718 million) of 2.375% fixed rate notes that mature on January 26, 2021

We received net proceeds of

€

2,381 million, or $3,239 million in U.S. dollars, on December 11, 2013, that
were used to partially fund the December 2013 tender offer. We also recorded approximately $27 million of discounts and deferred financing costs, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes.

On October 1, 2013, $1 billion of our 5.125% U.S. dollar notes and $800 million of our 5.250% U.S. dollar notes matured. The notes and accrued interest to date
were paid with cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper.

On May 8, 2013, $1 billion of our 2.625% U.S. dollar notes matured. The notes and accrued
interest to date were paid with cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper.

On February 11, 2013, $750 million of our 6.00% U.S. dollar notes matured.
The notes and accrued interest to date were paid with cash on hand.

Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt was 4.3% as of December 31, 2014,
down from 4.8% as of December 31, 2013.

Fair Value of Our Debt:

The fair value of our short-term borrowings at December 31, 2014 and 2013 reflects current market interest rates and approximates the amounts we have recorded on
our consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of our long-term debt was determined using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 valuation data) for the publicly traded debt obligations. At December 31, 2014, the aggregate fair value of our
total debt was $18,463 million and its carrying value was $16,700 million. At December 31, 2013, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $18,807 million and its carrying value was $17,079 million.

Level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist of exchange-traded commodity futures and listed options. The fair value of these
instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges. Our exchange-traded derivatives are generally subject to master netting arrangements that permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty when certain
criteria are met, such as in the event of default. We also are required to maintain cash margin accounts in connection with funding the settlement of our open positions, and the margin requirements generally fluctuate daily based on market
conditions. We have recorded margin deposits related to our exchange-traded derivatives of $84 million as of December 31, 2014 and $21 million as of December 31, 2013 within other current assets. Based on our net asset or liability
positions with individual counterparties, in the event of default and immediate net settlement of all of our open positions, for derivatives we have in a net liability position, we would owe $3 million as of December 31, 2014, and for
derivatives we have in a net asset position, our counterparties would owe us a total of $38 million as of December 31, 2014 and $17 million as of December 31, 2013.

Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter (“OTC”) currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and
options; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income
approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our calculation of the fair value of
interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of
nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require
collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our commodity and currency exchange OTC derivatives do not have a legal right of set-off. In connection with our OTC derivatives that could be net-settled in the event of default, assuming all
parties were to fail to comply with the terms of the agreements, for derivatives we have in a net liability position, we would owe $156 million as of December 31, 2014 and $40 million as of December 31, 2013, and for derivatives we have in
a net asset position, our counterparties would owe us a total of $72 million as of December 31, 2014 and $275 million as of December 31, 2013. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into
transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.

Pre-tax gains / (losses) on amounts excluded from effectiveness testing recognized in net earnings from continuing operations
included a pre-tax loss of $556 million we recognized in 2012 within interest and other expense, net related to certain forward-starting interest rate swaps for which the planned timing of the related forecasted debt was changed in connection with
our Spin-Off plans and related debt capitalization plans.

We record pre-tax and after-tax (i) gains or losses reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive earnings / (losses) into earnings, (ii) gains or losses on ineffectiveness and (iii) gains or losses on amounts excluded from effectiveness testing in:

•

cost of sales for commodity contracts;

•

cost of sales for currency exchange contracts related to forecasted transactions; and

•

interest and other expense, net for interest rate contracts and currency exchange contracts related to intercompany loans.

Based on current market conditions, we would expect to transfer unrealized losses of $20 million (net of taxes) for commodity cash flow hedges, unrealized gains of $53
million (net of taxes) for currency cash flow hedges and unrealized losses of $1 million (net of taxes) for interest rate cash flow hedges to earnings during the next 12 months.

Hedge Coverage:

•

currency exchange transactions for periods not exceeding the next 4 years and 10 months.

In connection with the planned coffee business transactions, we entered into euro to U.S. dollar currency exchange forward
contracts to hedge an expected cash receipt of

The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to the measurement date, was $1,474 million at
December 31, 2014 and $1,133 million at December 31, 2013 for the U.S. pension plans. The accumulated benefit obligation for the non-U.S. pension plans was $10,462 million at December 31, 2014 and $9,605 million at December 31,
2013.

For salaried and non-union hourly employees hired after January 1, 2009, we discontinued benefits under our U.S. pension plans and replaced them with an
enhanced Company contribution to our employee defined contribution plan. Effective December 31, 2019, benefit accruals will cease under the U.S. non-union pension plan. For non-union employees participating in that plan on December 31,
2019, we will calculate the pension benefit obligation based on pay and service as of that date and no longer accrue new benefits.

The combined U.S. and non-U.S.
pension plans resulted in a net pension liability of $2,882 million at December 31, 2014 and $1,946 million at December 31, 2013. We recognized these amounts in our consolidated balance sheets as follows:

Year-end discount rates for our U.S., Canadian, Eurozone and U.K. plans were developed from a model portfolio of high quality,

fixed-income

debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations. Year-end discount rates for our remaining non-U.S. plans were developed from local bond indices that
match local benefit obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical
long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.

The following costs are included within other expenses above. Employees who elected lump-sum payments in connection with our
2012-2014 Restructuring Program and cost saving initiatives and retired employees who elected lump-sum payments resulted in net settlement losses for our U.S. plans of $28 million in 2014, $1 million in 2013, and $113 million in 2012 (2012 includes
amounts related to the discontinued operation of Kraft Foods Group). Curtailment and settlement losses for our non-U.S. plans in 2014 included $12 million related to employees affected by our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and retired employees who
elected lump-sum payments. Non-U.S. plant closures and early retirement benefits resulted in curtailment and settlement losses of $2 million in 2013 and $9 million in 2012. In addition, we incurred special termination benefit costs of $2
million in 2014 and $1 million in 2013 in the non-U.S. plans related to the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program. We incurred special termination benefit costs of $13 million in 2012 in the non-U.S. plans related to the Cadbury integration.



For the U.S. plans, we determine the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost using a
calculated market return value that recognizes the cost over a four year period. For our non-U.S. plans, we utilize a similar approach with varying cost recognition periods for some plans, and with others, we determine the expected return on plan
assets based on asset fair values as of the measurement date.

As of December 31, 2014, for the combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, we expected to
amortize from accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) into net periodic pension cost during 2015:

•

an estimated $224 million of net loss from experience differences; and

•

less than $1 million of estimated prior service cost.

We excluded plan assets of $74 million at December 31, 2014 and $81 million at December 31, 2013 from the above tables
related to certain insurance contracts as they are reported at contract value, in accordance with authoritative guidance.

Fair value measurements:

•

Level 1 – includes primarily U.S and non-U.S. equity securities and government bonds valued using quoted prices in active markets.

•

Level 2 – includes primarily pooled funds, including assets in real estate pooled funds, valued using net asset values of participation units held in common collective trusts, as reported by the managers of the
trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. Level 2 plan assets also include corporate bonds and other fixed-income securities, valued using independent observable market inputs, such as matrix pricing, yield
curves and indices.

•

Level 3 – includes investments valued using unobservable inputs that reflect the plans’ assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets, based on the best information available.

•

Fair value estimates for pooled funds are calculated by the investment advisor when reliable quotations or pricing services are not readily available for certain underlying securities. The estimated value is based on
either cost, or last sale price for most of the securities valued in this fashion.

•

Fair value estimates for private equity investments are calculated by the general partners using the market approach to estimate the fair value of private investments. The market approach utilizes prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions, type of security, degree of liquidity, restrictions on the disposition, latest round of financing data, company financial statements, relevant valuation multiples and discounted cash flow
analyses.

•

Fair value estimates for real estate investments are calculated by the investment managers using the present value of future cash flows expected to be received from the investments, based on valuation methodologies such
as appraisals, local market conditions, and current and projected operating performance.

•

Fair value estimates for investments in hedge fund-of-funds are calculated by the investment managers using the net asset value per share of the investment as reported by the money managers of the underlying funds.

•

Fair value estimates for certain fixed-income securities such as insurance contracts are calculated based on the future stream of benefit payments discounted using prevailing interest rates based on the valuation date.

The increases in Level 3 pension plan investments during 2014 were primarily due to unrealized gains across most of the Level 3
asset categories and net transfers into pooled funds-fixed income securities offset by the effects of currency. The increases in Level 3 pension plan investments during 2013 were primarily due to net purchases in hedge funds.

For our U.S. plans, our investment strategy is based on our expectation that equity securities will outperform fixed-income
securities over the long term. We attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments. Due to the nature and timing of our expected pension liabilities, in the
first quarter of 2014, we strategically reduced the risk level of the investment portfolio relative to the liabilities of our plans by lowering our target allocation to equity securities (including investments in real estate) to 50% and increasing
the fixed-income allocation target to 50%. Historically we targeted an allocation of approximately 60% of our plan assets in equity securities and approximately 40% in fixed-income securities. The strategy uses indexed U.S. equity securities,
actively managed and indexed international equity securities and actively managed U.S. investment grade fixed-income securities (which constitute 95% or more of fixed-income securities) with lesser allocations to high yield fixed-income securities.
At December 31, 2013, we had a higher allocation to fixed income due to a voluntary $163 million contribution that was made on December 27, 2013 and temporarily invested in a short-term fixed income investment at year-end.



For our non-U.S. plans, the investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset / liability profiles of the
plans in each individual country. These specific circumstances result in a level of equity exposure that is typically less than the U.S. plans. In aggregate, the asset allocation targets of our non-U.S. plans are broadly characterized as a mix of
approximately 35% equity securities (including investments in real estate), approximately 50% fixed-income securities and approximately 15% other alternative securities. Our investment strategy for our largest non-U.S. plan, which comprises 50% of
our non-U.S. pension assets, is designed to balance risk and return by diversifying across a wide range of return-seeking and liability matching assets, invested in a range of both active and passive mandates. We target an allocation of
approximately 15% in equity securities, 18% credit, 13% private markets, 16% other diversifying assets, and 38% liability matching assets. The strategy uses actively managed and indexed global developed and emerging market equities, actively managed
global investment grade and alternative credit, global private equity and real estate, other diversifying assets including hedge funds, and other liability matching assets including a buy-in annuity policy. During 2013, the level of diversification
was strategically increased by reducing the plan’s equity exposure by approximately 10% and investing the majority of the proceeds in hedge funds and other diversifying assets.

Employer Contributions:

In 2014, we contributed $11 million to our U.S.
pension plans and $334 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. In addition, employees contributed $19 million to our non-U.S. plans. We make contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans primarily to the extent that they are tax deductible and
do not generate an excise tax liability.

In 2015, we estimate that our pension contributions will be $210 million to our U.S. plans and $319 million to our
non-U.S. plans based on current tax laws. Of the total 2015 pension contributions, $200 million is expected to be voluntary. Our actual contributions may be different due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, significant
differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates, or other factors.

Multiemployer Pension Plans:

We made
contributions to multiemployer pension plans of $32 million in 2014, $32 million in 2013 and $30 million in 2012. These plans provide pension benefits to retirees under certain collective bargaining agreements. The following is the only individually

Our contributions exceeded 5% of total contributions to the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund
(the “Fund”) for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012. Our contributions to the Fund were $25 million in 2014, $26 million in 2013 and $25 million in 2012. Our contribution to the Fund is based on our contribution rates under our collective
bargaining agreements, the number of our eligible employees and Fund surcharges. We expect our contribution for the next year to be approximately $30 million under the current collective bargaining arrangements. The Fund’s actuarial valuation
has been completed and the zone status was changed to “Red” in 2012. As a result of this certification, we are being charged a 10% surcharge on our contribution rates. Our expected future contributions include the surcharge. The Fund
adopted a rehabilitation plan on November 7, 2012 that requires contribution increases and reduction to benefit provisions.

Our contributions to other
multiemployer pension plans that were not individually significant were $7 million in 2014, $6 million in 2013 and $5 million in 2012. These contributions include contributions related to Kraft Foods Group employees who participated in our
multiemployer pension plans through October 1, 2012 of $2 million in 2012.



Other Costs:

We sponsor and
contribute to employee defined contribution plans. These plans cover eligible salaried, non-union and union employees. Our contributions and costs are determined by the matching of employee contributions, as defined by the plans. Amounts charged to
expense in continuing operations for defined contribution plans totaled $46 million in 2014, $66 million in 2013 and $74 million in 2012.

Year-end discount rates for our U.S., Canadian and U.K. plans were developed from a model portfolio of high quality,

fixed-income

debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations. Year-end discount rates for our remaining non-U.S. plans were developed from local bond indices that
match local benefit obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year. Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant impact on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A

Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings:

We routinely are involved in legal
proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations (“Legal Matters”) arising in the ordinary course of our business.

A compliant and
ethical corporate culture, which includes adhering to laws and industry regulations in all jurisdictions in which we do business, is integral to our success. Accordingly, after we acquired Cadbury in February 2010 we began reviewing and adjusting,
as needed, Cadbury’s operations in light of applicable standards as well as our policies and practices. We initially focused on such high priority areas as food safety, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and antitrust. Based
upon Cadbury’s pre-acquisition policies and compliance programs and our post-acquisition reviews, our preliminary findings indicated that Cadbury’s overall state of compliance was sound. Nonetheless, through our reviews, we determined that
in certain jurisdictions, including India, there appeared to be facts and circumstances warranting further investigation. We are continuing our investigations in certain jurisdictions, including in India, and we continue to cooperate with
governmental authorities.



As we previously disclosed, on February 1, 2011, we received a subpoena from the SEC in connection with an
investigation under the FCPA, primarily related to a facility in India that we acquired in the Cadbury acquisition. The subpoena primarily requests information regarding dealings with Indian governmental agencies and officials to obtain approvals
related to the operation of that facility. We are continuing to cooperate with the U.S. and Indian governments in their investigations of these matters, including through ongoing meetings with the U.S. government to discuss potential conclusion of
the U.S. government investigation.

On February 28, 2013, Cadbury India Limited (now known as Mondelez India Foods Limited), a subsidiary of Mondelēz
International, and other parties received a show cause notice from the Indian Department of Central Excise Authority (the “Excise Authority”). The notice calls upon the parties to demonstrate why the Excise Authority should not collect 2.5
billion Indian rupee (approximately $40 million U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2014) of unpaid excise tax as well as 2.5 billion Indian rupee (approximately $40 million U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2014) of penalties and interest
related to production at the same Indian facility. Subsequently, the Excise Authority issued another show cause notice, dated March 3, 2014, on the same issue but covering the period February to December 2013, thereby adding 1.2 billion Indian
rupee (approximately $19 million U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2014) of unpaid excise taxes as well as 1.2 billion Indian rupee (approximately $19 million U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2014) of penalties and interest to the amount
claimed by the Excise Authority. The latest notice includes an accruing claim for excise as finished products leave the facility on an ongoing basis. We believe that the decision to claim the excise tax benefit is valid and we are contesting the
show cause notice through the administrative and judicial process.

In April 2013, the staff of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) advised
us and Kraft Foods Group that it was investigating activities related to the trading of December 2011 wheat futures contracts that occurred prior to the Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group. We are cooperating with the staff in its investigation. In
October 2014, the staff advised us that the CFTC intends to commence a formal action against us and Kraft Foods Group. We continue to try to resolve this matter prior to any formal action being taken. It is not possible to predict the outcome of
this matter; however, based on our Separation and Distribution Agreement with Kraft Foods Group dated as of September 27, 2012, we expect to predominantly bear any monetary penalties or other payments that the CFTC may impose.

While we cannot predict with certainty the results of any Legal Matters in which we are currently involved, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of
these Legal Matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our financial results.

Third-Party Guarantees:

We enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will
make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2014, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.

As part of our 2010 Cadbury acquisition, we became the responsible party for tax matters under the Cadbury Schweppes Plc and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.
(“DPSG”) Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement dated May 1, 2008 (“Tax Indemnity”) for certain 2007 and 2008 transactions relating to the demerger of Cadbury’s Americas Beverage business. A U.S. federal tax audit of
DPSG for the 2006-2008 tax years was concluded with the IRS in August 2013. As a result, we recorded a favorable impact of $336 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $49 million in interest and other expense, net for a total
pre-tax impact of $385 million ($363 million net of tax) in the three months ended September 30, 2013 due to the reversal of the accrued liability in excess of the amount we paid to DPSG under the Tax Indemnity in the third quarter of 2013.

Leases:

Rental expenses recorded in continuing operations were $399
million in 2014, $386 million in 2013 and $341 million in 2012. As of December 31, 2014, minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases in effect at year-end were (in millions):

Note 12. Stock Plans

On May 21, 2014, our shareholders approved the Amended and Restated 2005 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”). Under the
amended plan, we now make grants to non-employee directors under the 2005 Plan, and we will no longer make any grants under the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “2006 Directors Plan”). We
also increased the number of shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan by 75.7 million, which includes the shares remaining available for issuance under the 2006 Directors Plan as of March 14, 2014. Under the 2005 Plan, we are now
authorized to issue a maximum of 243.7 million shares of our Common Stock. We may not make any grants under the 2005 Plan after May 21, 2024. As of December 31, 2014, there were 90.6 million shares available to be granted under
the 2005 Plan.

In connection with the Spin-Off and divestiture of Kraft Foods Group, under the provisions of our existing plans, employee stock option and
restricted and deferred stock awards were adjusted to preserve the fair value of the awards immediately before and after the Spin-Off. As such, we did not record any incremental compensation expense related to the conversion of the awards. In
connection with the stock awards held by our respective employees at the time of the Spin-Off, we collected a $55 million cash net settlement for the awards from Kraft Foods Group in March 2013.

Stock Options:

Stock options (including stock appreciation rights) are
granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the grant date, generally become exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a maximum term of ten years.

We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a

Black-Scholes

methodology to
measure stock option expense at the date of grant. The fair value of the stock options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period. We recorded compensation expense related to stock options held by our employees of $47
million in 2014, $39 million in 2013 and $39 million in 2012 in our results from continuing operations. The deferred tax benefit recorded related to this compensation expense was $12 million in 2014, $11 million in 2013 and $11 million in 2012. The
unamortized compensation expense related to our employee stock options was $67 million at December 31, 2014 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2 years.

Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions were:

The risk-free interest rate represents the constant maturity U.S. government treasuries rate with a remaining term equal to the
expected life of the options. The expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. Volatility reflects historical movements in our stock price for a period commensurate with the expected life of the options.
The dividend yield reflects the dividend yield in place at the time of the historical grants and reflects a lower expected dividend yield for Mondelēz International for grants made following the Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group.

Cash received from options exercised was $168 million in 2014, $139 million in 2013 and $205 million in 2012. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from the option exercises totaled $29 million in 2014,
$14 million in 2013 and $21 million in 2012.

In 2012, as a result of the Spin-Off, existing employee stock option awards were converted into an equivalent amount of additional Mondelēz International stock options in order to preserve the fair value of the
overall stock option awards granted.

Restricted Stock and Deferred Stock Units:

We may grant shares of restricted stock or deferred stock units to eligible employees, giving them, in most instances, all of the rights of shareholders, except that
they may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber the shares and our deferred stock units do not have voting rights until vested. Shares of restricted stock and deferred stock units are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions
are not met. Restricted stock and deferred stock units generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.

Performance share units granted in connection
with our long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) vest based on varying performance, market and service conditions. The unvested share units have no voting rights and do not pay dividends. Dividend equivalents accumulated over the vesting period
are paid after the share units vest.

The fair value of the restricted stock and deferred stock units at the date of grant is amortized to earnings over the
restriction period. We recorded compensation expense related to restricted stock and deferred stock units of $94 million in 2014, $94 million in 2013 and $90 million in 2012 in our results from continuing operations. The deferred tax benefit
recorded related to this compensation expense was $26 million in 2014, $28 million in 2013 and $27 million in 2012. The unamortized compensation expense related to our restricted stock and deferred stock units was $128 million at
December 31, 2014 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2 years.

Share Repurchase Program:

During 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $7.7 billion of our Common Stock through December 31, 2016. Repurchases under the program are
determined by management and are wholly discretionary. During 2014, we repurchased 51.9 million shares of Common Stock at an average cost of $36.43 per share, or an aggregate cost of $1.9 billion, of which $1.7 billion was paid during 2014 and
$0.2 billion was prepaid in December 2013 at the inception of an accelerated share repurchase program. All share repurchases were funded through available cash and commercial paper issuances. During 2013, we repurchased 82.8 million shares of
Common Stock at an average cost of $33.09 per share, or an aggregate cost of $2.7 billion. As of December 31, 2014, we have $3.1 billion in remaining share repurchase capacity.

In December 2013, we initiated an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) program. On December 3, 2013, we paid $1.7 billion and received an initial
delivery of 44.8 million shares of Common Stock valued at $1.5 billion. We increased treasury stock by $1.5 billion, and the remaining $0.2 billion was recorded against additional paid in capital. In May 2014, the ASR program concluded and we
received an additional 5.1 million shares, valued at $0.2 billion, for a total of 49.9 million shares with an average repurchase price of $34.10 per share over the life of the ASR program. The final settlement was based on the
volume-weighted average price of our Common Stock during the purchase period less a fixed per share discount. Upon conclusion of the ASR program and receipt of the remaining repurchased shares, the $0.2 billion recorded in additional paid in capital
was reclassified to treasury stock.

See Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions

, for information on taxes presented as part of discontinued operations
related to the resolution of the Starbucks arbitration and the Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group.

During 2014, we recorded out-of-period adjustments of $31 million net
expense that had an immaterial impact on the annual provision for income taxes. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a tax benefit of $43 million associated with the lapse of a statute of limitations that related to the third
quarter of 2014. The out-of-period adjustments were not material to the consolidated financial statements for any prior period.

The effective income tax rate on
pre-tax earnings differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the following reasons:

Our 2014 effective tax rate of 13.8% was favorably impacted by the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. tax jurisdictions and
net tax benefits from $206 million of discrete one-time events. The discrete net tax benefits primarily related to favorable tax audit settlements and expirations of statues of limitations in several jurisdictions.

Our 2013 effective tax rate of 2.5% was favorably impacted by the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. tax jurisdictions, net tax benefits from discrete one-time
events and the non-taxable portion of the Cadbury acquisition related indemnification resolution, partially offset by an unfavorable tax law change. The $299 million of discrete one-time events primarily related to favorable tax audit settlements
and expirations of statutes of limitations in several jurisdictions and the net reduction of U.K. deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2013 that reduced U.K. corporate income tax rates.

Our 2012 revised effective tax rate of 9.5% was favorably impacted by the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. tax jurisdictions and net tax benefits from discrete
one-time tax events, partially offset by non-deductible expenses. The $140 million of discrete one-time events primarily related to the net reduction of U.K. deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2012 that reduced
U.K. corporate income tax rates and net favorable tax audit settlements.

At December 31, 2014, the company has pre-tax loss carryforwards of $3,432 million, of which $1,430 million will expire at
various dates between 2015 and 2033 and the remaining $2,002 million can be carried forward indefinitely.

Our significant valuation allowances reside within our
operating subsidiaries in Mexico, Ireland and various other jurisdictions.

At December 31, 2014, applicable U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding
taxes had not been provided on approximately $13.2 billion of accumulated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. It is impractical for us to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on
these indefinitely reinvested earnings. Future tax law changes or changes in the needs of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could require us to recognize deferred tax liabilities on a portion, or all, of our accumulated earnings that were previously
expected to be indefinitely reinvested.

The changes in our unrecognized tax benefits were:

As of January 1, 2014, our unrecognized tax benefits were $1,189 million. If we had recognized all of these benefits,
the net impact on our income tax provision would have been $1,110 million. Our unrecognized tax benefits were $852 million at December 31, 2014, and if we had recognized all of these benefits, the net impact on our income tax provision would
have been $744 million. Within the next 12 months, our unrecognized tax benefits could increase by approximately $60 million due to unfavorable audit developments or decrease by approximately $145 million due to audit settlements and the expiration
of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. We include accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. We had accrued interest and penalties of $228 million as of January 1, 2014 and $184 million
as of December 31, 2014. Our 2014 provision for income taxes included $2 million for interest and penalties.

Under the Tax Sharing and Indemnity Agreements
between us and Kraft Foods Group, Kraft Foods Group generally assumes liability for all U.S. state income taxes and Canadian federal and provincial income taxes and we generally assume responsibility for all U.S. federal income taxes and
substantially all non-U.S. income taxes, excluding Canadian income taxes, for all tax periods prior to the Spin-Off. In addition, we transferred to Kraft Foods Group all of its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the Distribution Date. See
Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions.

Our income tax filings are regularly examined by federal, state and non-U.S. tax authorities. Our 2010-2012 U.S.
federal income tax filings are currently under examination by the IRS. U.S. state and non-U.S. jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from three to five years; however, these statutes are often extended by mutual agreement with
the tax authorities. Years still open to examination by non-U.S. tax authorities in major jurisdictions include (earliest open tax year in parentheses): Brazil (2009), France (2010), Germany (2005), India (2003), Italy (2009), United Kingdom
(2012) and Russia (2011).

Note 17. Segment Reporting

We manufacture and market primarily snack food and beverage products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate,
gum & candy, coffee & powdered beverages and various cheese & grocery products. We manage our global business and report operating results through geographic units.

Our operations and management structure are organized into five reportable operating segments:

•

Latin America

•

Asia Pacific

•

EEMEA

•

Europe

•

North America

We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing
business environments more effectively at a local level and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Beginning in 2015, within each region, we also manage by product category. The change will not affect our operating or
reportable segments. In the historical periods within our consolidated financial statements, we managed our operations within Latin America, Asia Pacific and EEMEA by location and within Europe and North America by product category.

We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze
segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative
expenses), amortization of intangibles, the benefit from the Cadbury acquisition-related indemnification resolution (which is a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), gains and losses on divestitures or acquisitions and
acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating
results. Furthermore, we centrally manage interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, we do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews.

Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have established
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the rules and forms of the SEC, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2014. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that,
due to a continued material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for income taxes, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2014. In light of this material
weakness, prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we undertook additional substantive procedures related to our disclosure controls, including validating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used for accounting for income
taxes.

These additional procedures have allowed us to conclude that, notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the
consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP.

Status of Remediation

Through December 31, 2014, we made substantial
progress toward remediating the material weakness in the internal control including:

•

revising and formalizing numerous income tax review processes,

•

redesigning and executing a new, more robust internal control set related to income tax accounting,

•

defining and clearly communicating roles and responsibilities for income tax accounting to local and regional personnel,

•

implementing new industry-standard technology tools utilized in the accounting for income taxes,

•

conducting extensive training on the accounting and control processes involving income tax accounting, and

•

hiring additional personnel with specific tax accounting expertise.

While significant improvement in the internal
controls was made through December 31, 2014, we continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the new internal controls to confirm that a sustainable, controlled process is fully in place. As we utilized outside tax advisors and resources during
2014 to execute many of the new processes and controls, we hired and continue to hire additional tax personnel across the Company. We have put in place processes to help ensure, and we continue to confirm, that sufficient knowledge transfer has
occurred and that relevant personnel and processes have been in operation for a sustained period of time.

We and our Board of Directors are committed to
maintaining a strong and sustainable internal control environment. We believe that the remediation work completed to date has significantly improved our internal control over the accounting for income taxes. We believe it is important to confirm
that the new processes and controls that we put in place as part of the remediation are fully operational for a sufficient period of time in order to provide the Company with adequate assurance of a sustainable and reliable control environment
related to income tax accounting.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted



accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

•

provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. Management based this assessment on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).

Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of
December 31, 2014, a material weakness in our internal control over accounting for income taxes continued to exist. Because of this material weakness, management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria. For information on the progress of the remediation of the material weakness, see

Status of Remediation

above.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

The errors arising from the underlying
deficiencies were not material to the financial results reported in any interim or annual period. For details of the current year adjustments, refer to Note 18,

Income Taxes

.

The control deficiencies in the aggregate could result in misstatements of the income tax accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the
annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, we have determined that the ineffective monitoring and oversight of controls over income tax accounting constituted a material weakness.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2014, as stated in their report that appears herein.

February 20, 2015

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management, together
with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2014. As outlined above, we added controls to remediate the material weakness related to our accounting for
income taxes. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2014, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
