PART I

Item 1.  Business.

General

Kraft Foods is the world’s second largest
food company with revenues of $49.2 billion and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of $3.6 billion in 2010. Kraft Foods was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. We have approximately 127,000 employees worldwide,
and we manufacture and market packaged food products, including biscuits, confectionery, beverages, cheese, convenient meals and various packaged grocery products. We sell our products to consumers in approximately 170 countries. At
December 31, 2010, we had operations in more than 75 countries and made our products at 223 manufacturing and processing facilities worldwide. At December 31, 2010, we had net assets of $35.9 billion and gross assets of $95.3 billion. We
are a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Standard & Poor’s 500, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the Ethibel Sustainability Index.

At December 31, 2010, our portfolio included eleven brands with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion each:

Oreo

,

Nabisco

and

LU

biscuits;

Milka

and

Cadbury

chocolates;

Trident

gum;

Jacobs

and

Maxwell House

coffees;

Philadelphia

cream cheeses;

Kraft

cheeses, dinners and dressings; and

Oscar Mayer

meats. Our portfolio included approximately 70 brands which each generate
annual revenues of more than $100 million.

Because Kraft Foods Inc. is a holding company, our principal source of funds is from our subsidiaries. Our
wholly owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock.

Reportable Segments

We manage and report operating results
through three geographic units: Kraft Foods North America, Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets. We manage the operations of Kraft Foods North America and Kraft


Foods Europe by product category, and we manage the operations of Kraft Foods Developing Markets by location. Our reportable segments are U.S. Beverages, U.S. Cheese, U.S. Convenient Meals,
U.S. Grocery, U.S. Snacks, Canada & North America Foodservice, Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets. The results of operations from our Cadbury Limited (formerly, Cadbury plc) (“Cadbury”) acquisition are reflected
within our U.S. Snacks, Canada & N.A. Foodservice, Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets segments.

Note 16,

Segment
Reporting

, to our consolidated financial statements includes a breakout of net revenues, segment operating income, total assets, depreciation expense and capital expenditures by reportable segment, as well as a breakout of net revenues,
long-lived assets and total assets by geographic region. Management uses segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment
performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), certain components of our U.S. pension plan cost (which is a component of cost of sales and
selling, general and administrative expenses), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) and amortization of intangibles.

The relative percentages of total segment operating income attributable to each reportable segment were:


(1)

Percentages were calculated based upon dollars rounded to millions.

(2)

We previously reported Biscuits and Confectionery combined as Snacks. With the Cadbury acquisition, the Biscuits and Confectionery sectors have been broken out
separately. The Biscuits sector primarily includes Cookies, Crackers and Salted Snacks. The Confectionery sector primarily includes Chocolate, Gum and Candy.

Our U.S. subsidiaries export coffee products, refreshment beverage products, grocery products, cheese, biscuits and processed meats. In 2010, these U.S. exports amounted to $563 million.

Products or similar products contributing 10% or more to Kraft Foods’ consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, were:

Our major brands within each reportable segment and consumer sector at December 31, 2010 were:


Significant
Acquisitions and Divestitures

Cadbury Acquisition:

On January 19, 2010, we announced the terms of our final offer for each outstanding ordinary share of Cadbury, including each ordinary share represented by an American Depositary Share (“Cadbury
ADS”), and the Cadbury Board of Directors recommended that Cadbury shareholders accept the terms of the final offer. On February 2, 2010, all of the conditions to the offer were satisfied or validly waived, the initial offer period expired
and a subsequent offer period immediately began. At that point, we had received acceptances of 71.73% of the outstanding Cadbury ordinary shares, including those represented by Cadbury ADSs (“Cadbury Shares”). As of June 1,
2010, we owned 100% of all outstanding Cadbury Shares. We believe the combination of Kraft Foods and Cadbury will create a global snacks powerhouse and an unrivaled portfolio of brands people love.

Under the terms of our final offer and the subsequent offer, we agreed to pay Cadbury shareholders 500 pence in cash and 0.1874 shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock
per Cadbury ordinary share validly tendered and 2,000 pence in cash and 0.7496 shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock per Cadbury ADS validly tendered. This valued Cadbury at $18.5 billion, or approximately £11.6 billion (based on the average
price of $28.36 for a share of Kraft Foods Common Stock on February 2, 2010 and an exchange rate of $1.595 per £1.00).


On February 2, 2010, we acquired 71.73% of Cadbury Shares for $13.1 billion and the value attributed to
noncontrolling interests was $5.4 billion. From February 2, 2010 through June 1, 2010, we acquired the remaining 28.27% of Cadbury Shares for $5.4 billion. We had a $38 million gain on noncontrolling interest acquired and recorded it
within additional paid in capital.

Pizza Divestiture:

On March 1, 2010, we completed the sale of the assets of our North American frozen pizza business (“Frozen Pizza”) to Nestlé USA, Inc. (“Nestlé”) for $3.7 billion. Our Frozen
Pizza business was a component of our U.S. Convenient Meals and Canada & N. A. Foodservice segments. The sale included the

DiGiorno

,

Tombstone

and

Jack’s

brands in the U.S., the

Delissio

brand in Canada and
the

California Pizza Kitchen

trademark license. It also included two Wisconsin manufacturing facilities (Medford and Little Chute) and the leases for the pizza depots and delivery trucks. Approximately 3,600 of our employees transferred with
the business to Nestlé. As a result of the divestiture, we recorded a gain on discontinued operations of $1,596 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, in 2010.

Post Cereals Split-off:

On August 4, 2008, we completed the split-off of the

Post

cereals business
into Ralcorp Holdings, Inc., after an exchange with our shareholders. Accordingly, the

Post

cereals business prior period results were reflected as discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings. The exchange was expected
to be tax-free to participating shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

In this split-off transaction, approximately 46 million shares
of Kraft Foods Common Stock were tendered for $1,644 million. Our shareholders had the option to exchange some or all of their shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock and receive shares of common stock of Cable Holdco, Inc. (“Cable Holdco”).
Cable Holdco was our wholly owned subsidiary that owned certain assets and liabilities of the

Post

cereals business. In exchange for the contribution of the

Post

cereals business, Cable Holdco issued approximately $665 million in debt
securities, issued shares of its common stock and assumed a $300 million credit facility. Upon closing, we used the cash equivalent net proceeds, approximately $960 million, to repay debt. As a result of the split-off, we recorded a gain on
discontinued operations of $926 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in 2008.

See Note 2,

Acquisitions and Divestitures

, to our consolidated
financial statements for additional information on these transactions.

Customers

Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 26% of our net revenues in 2010 compared with 27% in 2009 and 2008. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 35% of our net revenues in 2010
compared with 36% in 2009 and 2008. One of our customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 14% of our net revenues in 2010 compared with 16% in 2009 and 2008.

Seasonality

Demand for some of our products may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other annual
events. However, overall sales of our products are generally evenly balanced throughout the year due to the offsetting nature of demands for our diversified product portfolio.

Competition

We face competition in all aspects of our business. Competitors include large national and
international companies and numerous local and regional companies. Some competitors have different profit objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to currency exchange rates. We also compete with generic products and
retailer brands, wholesalers and cooperatives. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. Moreover, improving our market position or introducing a new product
requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures.

Distribution and Marketing

Our products are generally sold to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, convenience stores, gasoline
stations, drug stores, value stores and other retail food


outlets. In general, the retail trade for food products is consolidating. We distribute our products through distribution centers, satellite warehouses, company-operated and public cold-storage
facilities, depots and other facilities. We currently distribute most products in North America through a combination of direct store delivery and warehouse delivery. Outside of North America, our products are distributed through warehouse delivery
and through the services of independent sales offices and agents.

Our marketing efforts are conducted through three principal sets of activities:
(i) consumer marketing in on-air, print, outdoor and digital media; (ii) consumer incentives such as coupons and contests; and (iii) trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of our products by our
customers.

Raw Materials and Packaging

We
purchase large quantities of commodities, including dairy, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn products, soybean and vegetable oils, nuts, meat products, and sugar and other sweeteners. In addition, we use significant quantities of plastic, glass and
cardboard to package our products, and natural gas for our factories and warehouses. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production.

Significant cost items in chocolate confectionery products are cocoa and sugar. We purchase cocoa and sugar on world markets, and their prices are
affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar relative to certain other currencies. Cocoa bean, cocoa butter and sugar costs on average were higher in 2010 than in 2009. We
purchase our dairy raw material requirements, including milk and cheese, from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. The prices for milk and other dairy products are substantially influenced by market
supply and demand, as well as by government programs. Dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2010 than in 2009. The most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans, which we purchase on world markets. Green coffee bean
prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products. Green coffee bean costs on average were higher in 2010 than in
2009. Significant cost items in our biscuit and grocery products are grains (wheat, corn and soybean oil). Grain costs have experienced significant volatility as a result of burgeoning global demand for food, livestock feed and biofuels such as
ethanol and biodiesel. Grain costs on average decreased from 2009 to 2010.

During 2010, our aggregate commodity costs increased primarily as a result
of higher cocoa, sugar, dairy, coffee and meat costs, partially offset by lower grain costs. For 2010, our commodity costs were approximately $1.0 billion higher than 2009, following a decrease of approximately $150 million in 2009 compared to
2008. Overall, we expect commodity costs to continue to be volatile and to further increase in 2011.

The prices paid for raw materials and agricultural
materials used in our products generally reflect external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of the principal raw
materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact
of price fluctuations in our principal raw materials. However, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and these strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs.

Intellectual Property

We consider our trademarks, in the
aggregate, to be material to our business. We protect our trademarks by registration or otherwise in the U.S. and in other markets where we sell our products. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as
the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered. Registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. From time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in particular
locations. Similarly, we sell some products under brands we license from third parties, including at December 31, 2010:

•

Starbucks

coffee and

Seattle’s Best

coffee for sale in U.S. and European grocery stores and other distribution channels;

•

Starbucks

and

Seattle’s Best

coffee T-Discs for use in our

Tassimo

hot beverage system;

•

Capri Sun

packaged juice drinks for sale in the U.S. and Canada; and

•

Taco Bell Home Originals

Mexican style food products for sale in U.S. grocery stores.


Additionally, we own numerous patents worldwide. While our patent portfolio is material to our
business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business. We have either been issued patents or have patent applications pending that relate to a number of
current and potential products, including products licensed to others. Patents, issued or applied for, cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our
issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can
vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We consider that in the aggregate our patent
applications, patents and licenses under patents owned by third parties are of material importance to our operations.

We also have proprietary trade
secrets, technology, know-how processes and related intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Research and Development

We pursue four objectives in research and development: product safety and quality; growth through new products; superior consumer satisfaction; and
reduced costs. We have approximately 3,300 food scientists, chemists and engineers working primarily in 15 key technology centers: East Hanover, New Jersey; Glenview, Illinois; Madison, Wisconsin; Tarrytown, New York; Whippany, New Jersey; Banbury,
United Kingdom; Bournville, United Kingdom; Curitiba, Brazil; Eysins, Switzerland; Paris, France; Melbourne, Australia; Mexico City, Mexico; Munich, Germany; Reading, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China. These technology centers are equipped with
pilot plants and state-of-the-art instruments. Research and development expense was $583 million in 2010, $466 million in 2009, and $487 million in 2008.

Regulation

Our U.S. food products and packaging materials
are primarily regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or, for products containing meat and poultry, the U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These agencies enact
and enforce regulations relating to the manufacturing, distribution and labeling of food products. We supported the recently enacted law that provides additional food safety authority to the FDA. We do not expect the cost of complying with that
law, and implementing regulations expected over the next two to three years, to be material.

In addition, various states regulate our U.S.
operations by licensing plants, enforcing federal and state standards for selected food products, grading food products, inspecting plants and warehouses, regulating trade practices related to the sale of dairy products and imposing their
own labeling requirements on food products.

Many of the food commodities we use in our U.S. operations are subject to governmental
agricultural programs. These programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic U.S. Congressional and administrative review.

All of our non-U.S. based operations are subject to local and national regulations, some of which are similar to those applicable to our U.S. operations. For example, in the European
Union, we must comply with requirements that apply to labeling, packaging, food content, pricing, marketing and advertising and related areas.

Environmental Regulation

We are subject to various laws
and regulations in and outside of the U.S. relating to the protection of the environment. We accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are
adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when recovery of those costs is deemed probable.


In the U.S., the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act and Superfund (the environmental program established in the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and Recovery Act to address abandoned hazardous waste sites), which imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially
responsible party. At December 31, 2010, our subsidiaries were involved in 74 active actions in the U.S. under Superfund legislation (and other similar actions and legislation) related to current operations and certain former or divested
operations for which we retain liability.

Outside the U.S., we are subject to applicable multi-national, national and local environmental laws and
regulations in the countries in which we do business. Outside the U.S., we have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements.

As of December 31, 2010, we had accrued an insignificant amount for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental
remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results. However, we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and
environmental remedial actions.

Employees

At
December 31, 2010, we employed approximately 127,000 people worldwide. Labor unions represent approximately 27% of our 37,000 U.S. employees. Most of the unionized workers at our U.S. locations are represented under contracts with the Bakery,
Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union; the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union; and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. These contracts expire at various times throughout the next several
years. Outside the U.S., labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 55% of our 90,000 employees. Our business units are subject to various laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. These laws and
regulations are specific to the location of each business unit. In addition, in accordance with European Union requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We believe that
our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good.

Foreign Operations

We sell our products to consumers in approximately 170 countries. At December 31, 2010, we had operations in more than 75 countries and made our products at
223 manufacturing and processing facilities worldwide. We generated approximately 57% of our 2010 net revenues, 49% of our 2009 net revenues and 50% of our 2008 net revenues outside the U.S.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.

You should read the following risk
factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results,
financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there
may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, performance or financial condition in the future.

We operate in a highly competitive industry.

The food
industry is highly competitive. We compete based on price, product innovation, product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences.

We may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures in order to maintain our market share. Competition and
customer pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to


commodity and other cost increases. We may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase market share. These
expenditures are subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. Despite these expenditures, we may not successfully maintain or enhance market share. If we reduce prices or increase costs, but we cannot
increase sales volumes to offset those changes, then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer.

Maintaining our reputation and
brand image is essential to our business success.

Many of our brands are iconic, with worldwide recognition. Our success depends on our ability to
maintain brand image for our existing products, extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings.

We seek to
maintain, extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, and product innovation. Continuing global focus on health and wellness, including weight management, and increasing media
attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices. Increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising, consumer promotions and
marketing, or our response to such restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend and expand our brands. Moreover, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our
customers’ confidence and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations.

In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online
dissemination of advertising campaigns. We are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products, for instance marketing to children. These restrictions may limit our ability to maintain, extend and
expand our brand image as the media and communications environment continues to evolve. If we do not maintain, extend and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected.

We must leverage our value proposition to compete against retailer brands and other economy brands.

Retailers are increasingly offering retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products. Our products must provide higher value and /
or quality to our consumers than less expensive alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty such as those we continue to experience. Consumers may not buy our products if the difference in value or quality between our products
and retailer or other economy brands narrows or if consumers perceive a narrowing. If consumers prefer retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix could shift to
lower margin offerings. These effects could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

The consolidation of
retail customers could adversely affect us.

Retail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors in the U.S., the
European Union and our other major markets, continue to consolidate, resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business. Consolidation also produces large, more sophisticated retail customers that can resist price increases
and demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs or specifically tailored products. In addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market
their own retailer brands. Further retail consolidation may materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. For example, if
our customers do not have access to sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or refuse to pay us for previous purchases.

Changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us.

During 2010,
our five largest customers accounted for approximately 26% of our net revenues with our largest customer Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounting for approximately 14% of our net revenues. There can be no assurance that all significant customers
will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past. The loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product
sales, financial condition and results of operations.


Disputes with significant suppliers, including regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to
supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Commodity and other input prices are volatile and may rise significantly.

We purchase large quantities of commodities, including dairy, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn products, soybean and vegetable oils, nuts, meat products, and sugar and other sweeteners. In addition, we purchase and
use significant quantities of plastic, glass and cardboard to package our products, and natural gas to operate our factories and warehouses. Prices for commodities, other supplies and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that
are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, severe weather, consumer demand and changes in governmental trade and agricultural programs. For example, unusually adverse weather conditions, such as the
heat wave in the grain growing regions of Russia and Ukraine and recent severe drought in the grain growing regions of China, have contributed to rising wheat and corn costs in 2010 and we expect such conditions to continue in 2011. For 2010, our
commodity costs were approximately $1.0 billion higher than 2009. Although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program, and seek to hedge against price increases, continued volatility in the
prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer. Moreover, price increases to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes. If we are not
successful in our hedging activities, or if we are unable to price to cover increased costs, then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in regulations could increase our costs and affect our profitability.

Our activities in the United States and around the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight. Various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations govern food production and
marketing, as well as licensing, trade, tax and environmental matters. Governing bodies regularly issue new regulations and changes to existing regulations. Our need to comply with new or revised regulations or their interpretation and application,
including proposed requirements designed to enhance food safety or to regulate imported ingredients, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that affect our product sales, reputation and
profitability.

We are a large food company that operates in a highly regulated, highly competitive environment with growing retailer power and a
constantly evolving legal and regulatory framework around the world. Consequently, we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure
compliance with existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures. Moreover, the failure to maintain effective control environment processes could lead to
violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. Legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal
penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales, reputation and profitability.

Product recalls or other product liability
claims could materially and adversely affect us.

Selling products for human consumption involves inherent risks. We could decide to, or be required
to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination, spoilage or other adulteration, product misbranding or product tampering. Any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and product sales, financial condition or
results of operations.

We may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, or if our products cause injury,
illness or death. In addition, our marketing could be the target of claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us, or a
widespread product recall, may materially and adversely affect our profitability. Moreover, even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful, has no merit or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against
our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.


We are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate in a global environment, which could
affect our growth and financial performance.

We generated approximately 57% of our 2010 net revenues, 49% of our 2009 net revenues and 50% of our
2008 net revenues outside the U.S. With operations in more than 75 countries, our operations are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations. Those risks include:

•

compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the U.S., such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,

•

compliance with a variety of local regulations and laws,

•

changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws,

•

fluctuations in currency values,

•

sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls,

•

discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies,

•

difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions,

•

greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles,

•

effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our diverse operations, and

•

imposition of more or new tariff, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our sales outside the U.S.

Moreover, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public
corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product
sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Our operations in certain developing markets expose us to political, economic and regulatory
risks.

Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in developing markets, including Brazil, China, India, Mexico,
Russia and Southeast Asia. However, some developing markets have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than established markets. In many countries outside of the U.S.,
particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-bribery laws. These
laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and
criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, competition in developing
markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand their production capacities. Our success in integrating Cadbury’s operations and products, many of which have a strong presence in a
number of developing markets, is critical to our growth strategy. If we cannot successfully increase our business in developing markets, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Unanticipated business disruptions could affect our ability to provide our products to our customers.

We have a complex network of suppliers, owned manufacturing locations, co-manufacturing locations, distribution networks and information systems that support our
ability consistently to provide our products to our customers. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, like weather, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, generalized labor unrest or health pandemics, could damage or disrupt our
operations, or our suppliers’ or co-manufacturers’ operations. If we are unable to respond to disruptions in our operations, whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations, or
are unable to quickly repair damage to our information, production or supply systems, we may be late or unable to deliver products to our customers. If that were to occur, our customers’ confidence in us and long-term demand for our products
could decline. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We must
correctly predict, identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, and offer new products to meet those changes.

Consumer
preferences for food products change continually. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences. If we do not
offer products that appeal to consumers, our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer.


We must distinguish among short-term fads, mid-term trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we
do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales could decline. In addition, because of our varied consumer
base, we must offer an array of products sufficient to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster
growing and more profitable categories, demand for our products will decrease and our profitability could suffer.

Prolonged negative perceptions
concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. For example, recently, consumers have been increasingly focused on health and wellness,
including weight management and reducing sodium consumption. We strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, but we may be unsuccessful in these efforts. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer
preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Increased or unanticipated costs
or difficulties encountered in our continuing integration of Cadbury could affect our results of operations.

We continue to integrate the operations
of our Cadbury business into our existing business. We expect the anticipated synergies of integration to increase revenues and operating results through enhanced growth opportunities and increased cost savings. If we encounter difficulties in fully
integrating the businesses, it could delay or we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings, including the expected increases in revenues and operating results. If the difficulties are significant, our financial condition and
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Additionally, we expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with
combining our operations, including implementation cash costs that we estimate will be approximately $1.5 billion in the first three years following completion of the acquisition. Delays in integrating the businesses could cause such costs to be
significantly higher than anticipated.

We may not successfully complete proposed acquisitions or divestitures or integrate acquired businesses.

From time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives. If we are unable to
complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, including Cadbury, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may divest businesses that do not meet
our strategic objectives, or do not meet our growth or profitability targets. We may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income
from, those businesses may affect our profitability. Moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our profitability.

Our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial, managerial and operational risks. Those risks include diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating
or separating personnel and financial and other systems, effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our diverse employee population, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers,
inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings, potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses, and
indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers. Any of these factors could affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Our acquisition of Cadbury and disposition of
our Frozen Pizza business increased the portion of our assets, liabilities and earnings denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies, which increased our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial results and capital ratios are now
more sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates than in prior periods because a larger portion of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses must be translated into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. In addition, movements in
foreign exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries. We may seek to mitigate our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, but our efforts may not be successful. Accordingly, a
depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, or changes in the relative value of any two currencies that we use for transactions, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.


Business process improvement initiatives to harmonize our systems and processes may fail to operate as designed and
intended.

We regularly implement business process improvement initiatives designed to harmonize our systems and processes and improve our
performance. Significant current business process improvement initiatives include reorganization of our European operations, delivery of a SAP enterprise resource planning application, and outsourcing certain administrative functions. Our business
process improvement initiatives may not be successful, or may interfere with our core business operations or divert management attention from those operations. If we are unable to improve existing operations, achieve anticipated cost savings and
support future growth, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Downgrades in our
credit ratings and other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit market could reduce our liquidity or increase our borrowing costs and liquidity.

Our short- and long-term credit ratings affect our borrowing costs and access to financing. A downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial
paper. We access the commercial paper market for regular funding requirements. Disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit market also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we
could issue and could raise our borrowing costs for both short- and long-term debt offerings.

Volatility in the equity markets or interest rates
could substantially increase our pension costs and have a negative impact on our operating results and profitability.

At the end of 2010, the
projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was $15.6 billion and assets were $13.3 billion. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, significantly affects
the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Among other factors, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, investment returns and the market value of plan
assets can affect the level of plan funding, cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost, and increase our future funding requirements. In addition, if we divest certain businesses, we may be required to increase
future contributions to the benefit plans and the related net periodic pension cost could increase.

We expect to make approximately $940 million
in contributions to our pension plans in 2011, which is approximately $550 million more than we made in 2010. We also expect that our net pension cost will remain flat at approximately $530 million in 2011. Volatile economic conditions increase the
risk that we may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension cost beyond 2011.

Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments.

Not applicable.

Item 2.  Properties.

We have 223 manufacturing and processing facilities worldwide. This includes the 62 manufacturing and process facilities we obtained as part of our Cadbury acquisition. These facilities are located in 57 countries.
We have 57 facilities in Kraft Foods North America, 59 in Kraft Foods Europe and 107 In Kraft Foods Developing Markets.

We own 214 and lease 9 of these
manufacturing and processing facilities. It is our practice to maintain all of our plants and properties in good condition, and we believe they are suitable and adequate for our present needs.

We also have 236 distribution centers and depots worldwide. We own 51 of these distribution centers and depots, and we lease 185 of these distribution centers and
depots. In North America, we have 139 distribution centers and depots, more than 60% of which support our direct store delivery systems. Outside North America, we have 97 distribution centers and depots in 29 countries.


These facilities are located throughout the following regions:

These facilities are in good condition, and we believe they have sufficient capacity to meet our distribution needs in the
near term.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

We routinely are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inspections or investigations (“Legal Matters”) arising in the ordinary course of our business.

On November 29, 2010, we initiated an arbitration proceeding against Starbucks Coffee Company (“Starbucks”) to challenge Starbucks attempt to end
our retail coffee agreement without compensating us pursuant to the agreement’s termination provisions. On December 6, 2010, in a separate proceeding, we filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York against Starbucks to enjoin Starbucks from unilaterally terminating our agreement. The District Court denied our motion for preliminary injunction on January 28, 2011. On February 25, 2011, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the U.S. District Court’s ruling. Despite this ruling, our arbitration proceeding, which we are vigorously pursuing, will continue.

A compliant and ethical corporate culture, which includes adhering to laws and industry regulations in the United States and abroad, is integral to our success. To this end, after we acquired Cadbury in February
2010 we began reviewing and adjusting, as needed, Cadbury’s operations in light of U.S. and international standards as well as Kraft Foods’ policies and practices. We initially focused on such high priority areas as food safety, the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and antitrust. Based upon Cadbury’s pre-acquisition policies and compliance programs and our post-acquisition reviews, our preliminary findings indicated that Cadbury’s overall state of
compliance was sound. Nonetheless, through our reviews, we determined that in certain jurisdictions, including India, there appeared to be facts and circumstances warranting further investigation. We have undertaken these investigations, which are
ongoing.

On February 1, 2011, we received a subpoena from the SEC. The subpoena, issued in connection with an investigation under the FCPA, primarily
relates to a Cadbury facility in India that we acquired in the Cadbury acquisition and primarily requests information regarding dealings with Indian governmental agencies and officials to obtain approvals related to the operation of that facility.
We are cooperating with the U.S. government in its investigation of these matters.

While we cannot predict with certainty the results of these or any
other Legal Matters in which we are currently involved, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of these matters will have effect on our financial results.

Discussion and Analysis

Strategy

We are seeking to build a global Snacks powerhouse
with an unrivaled portfolio of brands people love. Our future growth is centered on three strategies: To delight global Snacks consumers; To unleash the Power of our Iconic Heritage Brands; and To Create a Performance-Driven, Values-Led
Organization, which we believe will allow us to deliver top-tier shareholder returns. We plan to drive sustained, profitable growth that will put us among the top performers of our industry. Our strategic focus on global snacks, iconic heritage
brands and our culture is intended to deliver robust top-line growth. Our ongoing overhead and cost saving efforts are fueling significant additional investments in marketing and innovation. We believe that these savings and investments, along with
our emphasis on the importance of superior execution, will generate sustained growth. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver consistent financial results in the top-tier of our peer group.

Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Cadbury
Acquisition:

On January 19, 2010, we announced the terms of our final offer for each outstanding ordinary share of Cadbury Limited (formerly,
Cadbury plc) (“Cadbury”), including each ordinary share represented by an American Depositary Share (“Cadbury ADS”), and the Cadbury Board of Directors recommended that Cadbury shareholders accept the terms of the final offer. On
February 2, 2010, all of the conditions to the offer were satisfied or validly waived, the initial offer period expired and a subsequent offer period immediately began. At that point, we had received acceptances of 71.73% of the
outstanding Cadbury ordinary shares, including those represented by Cadbury ADSs (“Cadbury Shares”). As of June 1, 2010, we owned 100% of all outstanding Cadbury Shares. We believe the combination of Kraft Foods and Cadbury will
create a global snacks powerhouse and an unrivaled portfolio of brands people love.

Under the terms of our final offer and the subsequent offer, we
agreed to pay Cadbury shareholders 500 pence in cash and 0.1874 shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock per Cadbury ordinary share validly tendered and 2,000 pence in cash and 0.7496 shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock per Cadbury ADS validly tendered.
This valued Cadbury at $18.5 billion, or approximately £11.6 billion (based on the average price of $28.36 for a share of Kraft Foods Common Stock on February 2, 2010 and an exchange rate of $1.595 per £1.00).

On February 2, 2010, we acquired 71.73% of Cadbury Shares for $13.1 billion and the value attributed to noncontrolling interests was $5.4 billion. From
February 2, 2010 through June 1, 2010, we acquired the remaining 28.27% of Cadbury Shares for $5.4 billion. We had a $38 million gain on noncontrolling interest acquired and recorded it within additional paid in capital.

As part of our Cadbury acquisition, we incurred and expensed transaction related fees of $218 million in 2010 and $40 million in 2009. We recorded these expenses
within selling, general and administrative expenses. We also incurred acquisition financing fees of $96 million in 2010. We recorded these expenses within interest and other expense, net.

Cadbury contributed net revenues of $9,143 million and net earnings of $530 million from February 2, 2010 through December 31, 2010. The following unaudited pro forma summary presents Kraft Foods’
consolidated information as if Cadbury had been acquired on January 1, 2009. These amounts were calculated after conversion to U.S. GAAP, applying our accounting policies, and adjusting Cadbury’s results to reflect the additional
depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets had been applied from January 1, 2009, together with the consequential tax effects. These
adjustments also reflect the additional interest expense incurred on the debt to finance the purchase, and the divestitures of certain Cadbury confectionery operations in Poland and Romania, as required by the EU Commission as a condition of our
Cadbury acquisition.


Our February 2, 2010, Cadbury acquisition was valued at $18,547 million, or $17,503 million net of cash and cash
equivalents. As part of that acquisition, we acquired the following assets and assumed the following liabilities (in millions):

(1)

The gross amount due under the receivables we acquired is $1,474 million, of which $141 million is expected to be uncollectable.

(2)

Goodwill will not be deductible for statutory tax purposes and is attributable to Cadbury’s workforce and the significant synergies we expect from the acquisition.

(3)

We acquired $10.3 billion of indefinitely lived intangible assets, primarily trademarks, and $2.6 billion of amortizable intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and
technology. Customer relationships will be amortized over approximately 13 years and technology will be amortized over approximately 12 years.

(4)

Within other current liabilities, a reserve for exposures related to taxes of approximately $70 million was established within our Developing Markets segment. The cumulative
exposure was approximately $150 million at December 31, 2010.

The above amounts represent the allocation of purchase price which was
completed during the fourth quarter of 2010.

Pizza Divestiture:

On March 1, 2010, we completed the sale of the assets of our North American frozen pizza business (“Frozen Pizza”) to Nestlé USA, Inc. (“Nestlé”) for $3.7 billion. Our Frozen
Pizza business was a component of our U.S. Convenient Meals and Canada & North America Foodservice segments. The sale included the

DiGiorno

,

Tombstone

and

Jack’s

brands in the U.S., the

Delissio

brand in
Canada and the

California Pizza Kitchen

trademark license. It also included two Wisconsin manufacturing facilities (Medford and Little Chute) and the leases for the pizza depots and delivery trucks. Approximately 3,600 of our employees
transferred with the business to Nestlé. Accordingly, the results of our Frozen Pizza business have been reflected as discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings, and prior period results have been revised in a
consistent manner. As a result of the divestiture, we recorded a gain on discontinued operations of $1,596 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, in 2010.

Pursuant to the Frozen Pizza business Transition Services Agreement, we agreed to provide certain sales, co-manufacturing, distribution, information
technology, accounting and finance services to Nestlé for up to two years.

Summary results of operations for the Frozen Pizza business
through March 1, 2010 were as follows:


Earnings before income taxes as presented exclude associated allocated overheads of $25 million in 2010, $108 million
in 2009 and $112 million in 2008.

The 2010 gain on discontinued operations from the sale of the Frozen Pizza business included tax expense of $1.2
billion.

The following assets of the Frozen Pizza business were included in the Frozen Pizza divestiture (in millions):

Post Cereals Split-off:

On August 4, 2008, we completed the split-off of the

Post

cereals business into Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. (“Ralcorp”), after an exchange with our shareholders. Accordingly, the

Post

cereals business prior period results were reflected as discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings. The exchange was expected to be tax-free to participating shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

In this split-off transaction, approximately 46 million shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock were tendered for $1,644 million. Our shareholders had the option
to exchange some or all of their shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock and receive shares of common stock of Cable Holdco, Inc. (“Cable Holdco”). Cable Holdco was our wholly owned subsidiary that owned certain assets and liabilities of the

Post

cereals business. In exchange for the contribution of the

Post

cereals business, Cable Holdco issued approximately $665 million in debt securities, issued shares of its common stock and assumed a $300 million credit facility. Upon
closing, we used the cash equivalent net proceeds, approximately $960 million, to repay debt. As a result of the split-off, we recorded a gain on discontinued operations of $926 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in 2008.

The

Post

cereals business included such brands as

Honey Bunches of Oats

,

Pebbles

,

Shredded Wheat

,

Selects

,

Grape-Nuts

and

Honeycomb

. Under Kraft Foods, the brands in this transaction were distributed primarily in North America. In addition to the

Post

brands, the transaction included four manufacturing facilities, certain manufacturing equipment and
approximately 1,230 employees who joined Ralcorp as part of the transaction.

Pursuant to the

Post

cereals business Transition Services
Agreement, we provided certain sales, co-manufacturing, distribution, information technology, and accounting and finance services to Ralcorp through 2009.

Summary results of operations for the

Post

cereals business through August 4, 2008, were as follows:

Other Divestitures:

The EU Commission required, as a condition of our Cadbury acquisition, that we divest certain Cadbury confectionery operations in Poland and Romania. In 2010, we
completed the sale of the assets of the confectionery operations in Poland and Romania. The total proceeds from the divestitures were $342 million and the impacts of these divestitures were primarily reflected as adjustments to the purchase price
allocations.


In 2009, we received $41 million in net proceeds and recorded pre-tax losses of $6 million on the divestitures of our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S., a juice operation in Brazil and a plant in Spain. We recorded after-tax gains of $58 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, on these divestitures, primarily due to the differing book and tax bases of our

Balance

bar operations.

In 2008, we received $153 million in net proceeds, and recorded pre-tax losses of $92 million on divestitures, primarily
related to a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and four operations in Spain. We recorded after-tax losses of $64 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, on these divestitures.

Included in the 2008 divestitures were the following, which were a condition of the EU Commission’s approval of our Groupe Danone S.A. global

LU

biscuit business (“LU Biscuit”) acquisition:

•

We divested a biscuit operation in Spain. From this divestiture, we received $86 million in net proceeds and recorded pre-tax losses of $74 million.

•

We divested another biscuit operation in Spain and a trademark in Hungary that we had previously acquired as part of the

LU

Biscuit acquisition. As such,
the impacts of these divestitures were reflected as adjustments to the purchase price allocations.

The aggregate operating results of
the divestitures discussed above, other than the divestiture of the Frozen Pizza and

Post

cereals businesses, were not material to our financial statements in any of the periods presented. Refer to Note 16,

Segment Reporting

, for
details of the gains and losses on divestitures by segment. The net impacts to segment operating income from gains and losses on divestitures, along with resulting asset impairment charges, are summarized in the table with the Asset Impairment
Charges section below.

Asset Impairment Charges

In 2010, we recorded aggregate asset impairment charges of $55 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. During our 2010 review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $13 million charge for the
impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands and a $30 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in China. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we also recorded an asset impairment of $12 million on a biscuit plant and related
property, plant and equipment in France. We recorded the aggregate asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs.

In 2009, we
recorded aggregate asset impairment charges of $21 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. During our 2009 review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $12 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the
Netherlands. In addition, during 2009, we recorded a $9 million asset impairment charge to write off an investment in Norway. We recorded the aggregate asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs.

In 2008, we recorded aggregate asset impairment charges of $140 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. During our 2008 review of goodwill and non-amortizable
intangible assets, we recorded a $44 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands, France and Puerto Rico. In addition, in December 2008, we reached a preliminary agreement to divest a juice operation in Brazil and
reached an agreement to sell a cheese plant in Australia. In anticipation of divesting the juice operation in Brazil, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The charge primarily included the write-off of
associated intangible assets of $8 million and property, plant and equipment of $4 million. In anticipation of selling the cheese plant in Australia, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $28 million to property, plant and equipment in the
fourth quarter of 2008. Additionally, in 2008, we divested a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation, and incurred an asset impairment charge of $55 million in connection with the divestiture. This charge primarily included the write-off of
associated goodwill of $34 million and property, plant and equipment of $16 million. We recorded the aggregate asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs.


The net impacts to segment operating income from gains and losses on divestitures and the related asset impairment
charges recorded when these divestitures were considered held-for-sale are summarized in the table below.

Restructuring Costs

Within our restructuring programs and initiatives, we include certain costs along with exit and disposal costs that are directly attributable to those activities
yet they do not qualify for treatment as exit or disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These costs, which we commonly refer to as other project costs or implementation costs, generally include the integration and reorganization of operations and
facilities, the discontinuance of certain product lines and the incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities. Management believes the disclosure and inclusion of these charges provides readers of our financial statements greater
transparency to the total costs of our programs and initiatives.

Integration Program:

Our combination with Cadbury has the potential for meaningful synergies and costs savings. We expect to recognize at least $750 million of cost savings by the end of the third year following completion of the
acquisition. Additionally, we expect to create revenue synergies from investments in distribution, marketing and product development. In order to achieve these cost savings and synergies, we expect to incur total integration charges of approximately
$1.5 billion in the first three years following the acquisition to combine and integrate the two businesses (the “Integration Program”).

Integration Program costs include the costs associated with combining our operations with Cadbury’s and are separate from the costs related to the
acquisition. We incurred charges under the Integration Program of $657 million in 2010. We recorded these charges primarily in operations as a part of selling, general and administrative expenses within our Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods
Developing Markets segments, as well as general corporate expenses. At December 31, 2010, we had an accrual of $406 million related to the Integration Program.

During the second quarter of 2010, we evaluated Cadbury’s Vision into Action (“VIA”) restructuring program and began managing it within our overall Integration Program. Cadbury initiated the VIA
restructuring program in 2007 and planned to run it through 2011. Accordingly, we acquired an accrual of $228 million relating to charges taken in previous periods. In evaluating the program as part of our corporate strategies and our integration
plans, we included the remaining charges within our overall Integration Program. As we move forward on a combined company basis, we do not intend to manage these programs separately.


Cost Savings Initiatives:

Cost savings initiatives generally include exit, disposal and other project costs. We incurred costs associated with our Cost Savings Initiatives of $170 million in 2010, $318 million in 2009, and none in 2008.

•

In 2010, we primarily recorded these changes within the segment operating income of Kraft Foods Europe and Canada & N.A. Foodservice. The majority of
these charges incurred were for other project costs associated with the Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization.

•

The 2009 charges primarily included severance charges for benefits received by terminated employees, associated benefit plan costs and other related activities.
These were recorded in operations, primarily within the segment operating income of Kraft Foods Europe, with the remainder spread across all other segments.

2004-2008 Restructuring Program:

In 2008, we completed our five-year restructuring program (the
“Restructuring Program”). The objectives of this program were to leverage our global scale, realign and lower our cost structure, and optimize capacity. As part of the Restructuring Program, we:

•

incurred $2.9 billion in pre-tax charges reflecting asset disposals, severance and implementation costs;

•

announced the closure of 35 facilities and announced the elimination of approximately 18,200 positions;

•

will use cash to pay for $1.9 billion of the $2.9 billion in charges; and

•

anticipate reaching cumulative annualized savings of $1.4 billion for the total program.

In 2010, we reversed $37 million of previously accrued Restructuring Program charges, primarily related to severance (resulting in a favorable impact to diluted
EPS of $0.01). In 2009, we reversed $85 million of previously accrued Restructuring Program charges (resulting in a favorable impact to diluted EPS of $0.04). The reversals in 2009 related to the following:

•

We sold a plant in Spain that we previously announced we would close under our Restructuring Program. Accordingly, we reversed $35 million in Restructuring
Program charges, primarily related to severance, and recorded a $17 million loss on the divestiture of the plant in 2009. The reversal occurred in our Kraft Foods Europe segment.

•

We also reversed $50 million of previously accrued Restructuring Program charges in 2009, primarily due to planned position eliminations that did not occur.
These were primarily the result of redeployment and natural attrition. The majority of these reversals occurred in our Kraft Foods Europe segment, with the remainder spread across all other segments.

We incurred charges under the Restructuring Program of $989 million in 2008, or $0.45 per diluted share. Since the inception of the Restructuring Program, we have
paid cash of $1.8 billion of the $1.9 billion in expected cash payments, including $94 million paid in 2010. At December 31, 2010, we had an accrual of $125 million related to the Restructuring Program, and we anticipate utilizing the majority
of it during 2011.

Under the Restructuring Program, we recorded asset impairment and exit costs of $884 million in 2008. We recorded implementation
costs of $105 million in 2008.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 31.5% in 2010, 28.8% in 2009, and 28.2% in 2008. Our 2010 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $123 million, primarily due to the favorable resolution of a federal tax audit
and the resolution of several items in our international operations, partially offset by a $137 million write-off of deferred tax assets as a result of the U.S. health care legislation enacted in March 2010.

Our 2009 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $225 million, primarily due to an agreement we reached with the IRS on specific matters related to years
2000 through 2003, settlements with various foreign and state tax authorities, the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and the divestiture of our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S.


Our 2008 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $222 million from discrete tax events. Of the total net
tax benefits, approximately $50 million related to fourth quarter corrections of state, federal and foreign tax liabilities and a third quarter reconciliation of our inventory of deferred tax items that resulted in a write-down of our net deferred
tax liabilities. The remaining net tax benefits primarily related to the resolution of various tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. Other discrete tax benefits included the impact from divestitures
of a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and several operations in Spain and the tax benefit from impairment charges taken in 2008. In addition, the 2008 tax rate benefited from foreign earnings taxed below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and
from the expected tax benefit of 2008 restructuring expenses. These benefits were only partially offset by state tax expense and certain foreign tax costs.

Consolidated Results of Operations

The following discussion compares our consolidated results of operations
for 2010 with 2009, and for 2009 with 2008.

Many factors have an impact on the sales to our customers, including, among others, the timing of holidays
and other annual or special events, significant weather conditions, timing of our own or customer incentive programs and pricing actions, customer inventory programs and general economic conditions.

Our domestic operating subsidiaries report results as of the last Saturday of the year, and our international operating subsidiaries generally report results two
weeks prior to the last Saturday of the year. The results of operations of the newly acquired Cadbury Limited (formerly, Cadbury plc) (“Cadbury”) are reported on the last day of the calendar month. In 2010, we changed the consolidation
date for certain European biscuits operations, which are included within our Kraft Foods Europe segment, and certain operations in Asia Pacific and Latin America, which are included within our Kraft Foods Developing Markets segment. Previously,
these operations primarily reported period-end results one month or two weeks prior to the end of the period. Now our Kraft Foods Europe segment primarily reports period-end results two weeks prior to the last Saturday of the period, and certain of
our operations in Asia Pacific and Latin America report results through the last day of the period.

2010 compared with 2009

Net Revenues

- Net revenues
increased $10,453 million (27.0%) to $49,207 million in 2010, and organic net revenues

(1)

increased $1,430 million (3.7%) to $40,075 million as follows.


The increase in net revenues was primarily driven by the Cadbury acquisition, which added $9,143 million in net
revenues during the year. The increase was partially offset by the impact of divestitures and unfavorable foreign currency, due primarily to the impacts of the highly inflationary Venezuelan economy and the strength of the U.S. dollar against the
euro, partially offset by the strength of the Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, Australian dollar and Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar. Additionally, increased organic net revenues were driven by favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing.
Favorable volume/mix was driven by higher base business shipments across all reportable business segments, except U.S. Cheese and U.S. Grocery. Higher net pricing was reflected across all reportable business segments, except Kraft Foods Europe and
U.S. Snacks, as we increased pricing to offset higher input costs.

Operating Income

- Operating income increased $483 million (9.3%) to
$5,666 million in 2010, due to the following:

Input cost increases outpaced pricing during the year. Higher raw material costs more than offset lower manufacturing costs
and higher pricing was driven by the increased input costs we experienced during the year. The favorable volume/mix was driven primarily by strong contributions from Kraft Foods Developing Markets, Kraft Foods Europe, U.S. Beverages and U.S.
Convenient Meals, partially offset by declines in U.S. Grocery, U.S. Cheese and U.S. Snacks. The Cadbury acquisition, net of Integration Program and higher acquisition-related costs, increased operating income by $260 million. Total selling, general
and administrative expenses, as recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings, increased $3,217 million from 2009, but excluding the impacts of divestitures, foreign currency and our Cadbury acquisition (including Integration Program
and acquisition-related costs), decreased $25 million versus the prior year. We recognized gains of $67 million in unrealized hedging positions in 2010, versus gains of $203 million in 2009. During 2010, we reversed $37 million in Restructuring
Program charges recorded in prior years, versus a reversal of $85 million in Restructuring Program charges recorded in prior years during 2009. We recorded asset impairment charges of $55 million in 2010 related to intangible assets in China and the
Netherlands and on a biscuit plant and related property, plant and equipment in France, versus asset impairment charges of $21 million related to intangible assets in the Netherlands and to write off an investment in Norway that were recorded in
2009. In addition, unfavorable foreign currency decreased operating income by $8 million, due primarily to the impacts of the highly inflationary Venezuelan economy and the strength of the U.S. dollar against the euro, partially offset by the
strength of the Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, Korean won and Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar.

As a result of these changes, operating
income margin decreased from 13.4% in 2009 to 11.5% in 2010.


Net Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Kraft Foods

- Net earnings attributable to Kraft Foods of
$4,114 million increased by $1,093 million (36.2%) in 2010. Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Kraft Foods were $1.44 in 2010, down 23.8% from $1.89 in 2009. Diluted EPS attributable to Kraft Foods were $2.39 in 2010, up
17.7% from $2.03 in 2009, due to the following:

(1)

Please see the

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

section at the end of this Item.

(2)

Excludes impacts of acquisition-related interest and other expense, net.

(3)

Excludes the impacts of the 2010 U.S. health care legislation on deferred taxes and includes the impacts of the U.S. federal tax audit agreements in both 2010 and 2009.

2009 compared with 2008


Net Revenues

- Net revenues decreased $1,738 million (4.3%) to $38,754 million in
2009, and organic net revenues

(1)

increased $428 million (1.1%) to
$40,565 million as follows.

The decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency of $1,884 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the
euro, Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnia, Canadian dollar, pound sterling, Brazilian real and Polish zloty. The impact of divestitures also had an unfavorable impact on net revenues. The decrease in net revenues was partially offset by higher organic
net revenues. The increase in organic net revenues was primarily driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by a decrease in volume/mix and the absence of the 2008 favorable resolution of a Brazilian value added tax claim.

Operating Income

- Operating income increased $1,607 million (44.9%) to $5,183 million in 2009, due to the following:

Higher pricing reflected the carryover impact of 2008 pricing actions, as we recovered some of our cumulative cost increases
from prior years. The favorable volume/mix was driven by strong contributions from Kraft Foods Developing Markets and U.S. Beverages. The decrease in input costs was driven by lower raw material costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.
During 2009, we reversed $85 million in Restructuring Program charges recorded in the prior year, versus the $989 million in Restructuring Program charges recognized in 2008. We recognized gains of $203 million on the change in unrealized hedging
positions in 2009, versus losses of $205 million in 2008. We recorded $6 million of net losses on divestitures in 2009, versus $92 million of net losses on divestitures in 2008. We recorded asset impairment charges of $21 million related to
intangible assets in the Netherlands and to write off an investment in Norway in 2009, versus asset impairment charges of $140 million related to certain international intangible assets, the divestiture of our Nordic and Baltic snacks operation, a
juice operation in Brazil and a cheese plant in Australia that were recorded in 2008. We had $22 million of lower charges from certain legal


matters. During 2009, we recorded an additional $50 million of charges for legal matters related to certain of our European operations. In 2008, we recorded $72 million in charges for legal
matters related to certain of our U.S. and European operations, including U.S. coffee operations. Total selling, general and administrative expenses, as recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings, increased $171 million from 2008. Excluding
the impacts of divestitures, foreign currency, charges for certain legal matters, acquisition-related costs associated with Cadbury and prior year Restructuring Program costs it increased $569 million over 2008, primarily due to further investments
in our brands, including spending on Cost Savings Initiatives, and higher marketing support costs. In addition, unfavorable foreign currency decreased operating income by $325 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the
pound sterling, euro, Canadian dollar, Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnia, Korean won, Brazilian real, and Polish zloty.

As a result of these changes,
operating income margin also increased from 8.8% in 2008 to 13.4% in 2009.

Net Earnings and Earnings per Share Attributable to Kraft Foods

- Net
earnings attributable to Kraft Foods of $3,021 million increased by $137 million (4.8%) in 2009. Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Kraft Foods were $1.89 in 2009, up 71.8% from $1.10 in 2008. Diluted EPS attributable to
Kraft Foods were $2.03 in 2009, up 6.8% from $1.90 in 2008, due to the following:

Results of Operations by Business Segment

We manage and report operating results through three geographic
units, Kraft Foods North America, Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets. We manage the operations of Kraft Foods North America and Kraft Foods Europe by product category, and we manage the operations of Kraft Foods Developing Markets
by location. Our reportable segments are U.S. Beverages, U.S. Cheese, U.S. Convenient Meals, U.S. Grocery, U.S. Snacks,


Canada & N.A. Foodservice, Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets. The results of operations from our Cadbury acquisition (including Integration Program and
acquisition-related costs), are reflected within our U.S. Snacks, Canada & N.A. Foodservice, Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets segments.

The following discussion compares our results of operations for each of our reportable segments for 2010 with 2009, and for 2009 with 2008.

As discussed in Note 16,

Segment Reporting

, management uses segment operating income to evaluate segment performance
and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of
cost of sales), certain components of our U.S. pension plan cost (which are a component of cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative
expenses) and amortization of intangibles for all periods presented. We exclude the unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Once
realized, the gains and losses on hedging activities are recorded within segment operating results. We exclude certain components of our U.S. pension plan cost from segment operating income because we centrally manage pension plan funding decisions
and the determination of discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions. Therefore, we allocate only the service cost component of our U.S. pension plan expense to segment operating income.

In 2010, the change in unrealized gains on hedging activities of $67 million primarily resulted from gains associated with commodity hedging activities. In 2009,
the change in unrealized gains on hedging activities of $203 million primarily resulted from the 2008 unrealized losses on energy derivatives becoming realized in 2009 and therefore,


included in segment operating income. In 2008, the change in unrealized losses on hedging activities of $205 million primarily related to energy derivatives, including heating oil (used primarily
to hedge transportation costs) and natural gas contracts.

The 2010 increase in general corporate expenses was primarily due to acquisition-related
transaction fees, Integration Program costs and the impact of Cadbury’s corporate charges. We incurred acquisition-related transaction fees of $218 million in 2010 and $40 million in 2009. We recorded these charges in operations as part of
general corporate expenses. In 2009, general corporate expenses included $50 million of charges for legal matters related to certain of our European operations. In 2008 we recorded $72 million in charges for legal matters related to certain of our
U.S. and European operations, including U.S. coffee operations and represented the primary reason general corporate expenses increased $101 million in 2008.

U.S. Beverages

2010 compared with 2009:

Net revenues increased $155 million (5.1%), due to favorable volume/mix (4.5 pp) and higher net pricing (0.6 pp). The favorable volume/mix impact on net
revenue was primarily driven by higher shipments in ready-to-drink beverages, reflecting volume gains in

Kool-Aid

and

Capri Sun

; coffee, reflecting volume gains in

Maxwell House, Starbucks and Tassimo

; and powdered beverages,
reflecting volume gains in

Tang

.

Segment operating income increased $53 million (10.4%), due to favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs,
higher net pricing and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher raw material costs and higher marketing support costs.

2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues increased $56 million (1.9%), due to favorable volume/mix (1.3 pp) and
higher net pricing (0.6 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven by higher shipments in ready-to-drink and powdered beverages. Ready-to-drink beverages grew from successful quality and marketing investments in

Capri Sun,

partially offset by
the discontinuation of less profitable ready-to-drink product lines. Powdered beverages volume increased primarily due to strong gains in

Kool-Aid

and

Tang.

These favorable factors were partially offset by unfavorable mix driven by the
higher ready-to-drink volume. In addition, coffee volume declined primarily driven by lower shipments of

Gevalia

, partially offset by higher shipments in

Maxwell House, Starbucks

and

Tassimo

. Higher net pricing was primarily
related to ready-to-drink beverages, partially offset by lower input cost-driven pricing in coffee.

Segment operating income increased $130 million
(34.1%), due primarily to lower costs due to the completion of the Restructuring Program, lower raw material costs, higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix (higher shipments, net of unfavorable product mix), lower manufacturing costs and lower
other selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher marketing support costs.


U.S. Cheese

2010 compared with 2009:

Net revenues decreased $77 million (2.1%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (4.7 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.4 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing
(3.0 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by lower shipments across most cheese categories. Higher net pricing, across all cheese categories, was due to input cost-driven pricing, partially offset by increased promotional spending.

Segment operating income decreased $69 million (10.3%), due to higher raw material costs (primarily higher dairy costs), unfavorable volume/mix, higher marketing
support costs and a loss on the divestiture of our

Bagelfuls

operations, partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of divestitures.

2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues decreased $402
million (10.0%), due to lower net pricing (8.8 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (1.2 pp). Lower net pricing was due to lower input cost-driven pricing combined with increases in promotional spending. Net revenues also declined due to lower shipments,
primarily in cultured and natural cheese products.

Segment operating income increased $104 million (18.5%), due primarily to lower raw material costs
(primarily lower dairy costs), lower manufacturing costs, lower costs due to the completion of the Restructuring Program and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower net pricing and higher marketing support
costs.

U.S. Convenient Meals

2010 compared with 2009:

Net revenues increased $102 million (3.4%), due to favorable volume/mix (3.1 pp) and higher net pricing (0.3 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven by higher
shipments in hot dogs,

Lunchables

combination meals and cold cuts. Higher net pricing was driven by input-cost driven pricing, mostly offset by increased promotional spending.

Segment operating income increased $34 million (14.5%), due to lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower manufacturing costs, favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing, partially offset by
higher raw material costs and higher marketing support costs.


2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues increased $82 million (2.8%), due to higher net pricing (2.8 pp). Higher net pricing was driven by input cost-driven pricing, net of increased promotional spending. Volume/mix was flat as higher
shipments in bacon, cold cuts and hot dogs were offset by the discontinuation of less profitable product lines.

Segment operating income increased $109
million (87.2%), due primarily to higher net pricing, lower costs due to the completion of the Restructuring Program and favorable volume/mix, partially offset by higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and higher marketing support
costs.

U.S. Grocery

2010 compared with 2009:

Net revenues decreased $55 million (1.6%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (3.3 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (1.7 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was
due primarily to lower shipments across most key categories, including pourable dressings, ready-to-eat desserts, spoonable dressings and dry packaged desserts. Higher net pricing, across key categories, was primarily related to

Kraft

macaroni and cheese dinners, pourable dressings, ready-to-eat desserts and dry packaged desserts.

Segment operating income increased $18 million
(1.6%), due primarily to higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing support costs.

2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues increased $64 million
(1.9%), due to higher net pricing (3.5 pp), partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix (1.6 pp). Net revenues increased due to higher input cost-driven pricing across several of our key categories, primarily spoonable salad dressings, dry
packaged desserts and ready-to-eat desserts. Net revenues growth was partially offset by lower volume, net of favorable product mix. This reflected the 2008 exit of

Handi-Snacks

ready-to-eat desserts, as well as lower shipments in pourable
and spoonable salad dressings,

Jell-O

ready-to-eat-desserts, barbecue sauce and

Cool Whip

whipped topping, which were partially offset by growth in

Kraft

macaroni and cheese dinners.

Segment operating income increased $137 million (13.6%), due primarily to higher net pricing, lower costs due to the completion of the Restructuring Program and
lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher marketing support costs, unfavorable volume/mix (lower shipments, net of improved product mix) and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.

U.S. Snacks


2010 compared with 2009:

Net revenues increased $1,037 million (20.9%), due to our Cadbury acquisition (21.7 pp) and favorable volume/mix (0.5 pp), partially offset by the impact of divestitures (1.1 pp) and lower net pricing (0.2 pp).
Biscuits net revenues decreased, driven by unfavorable volume/mix, partially offset by higher net pricing. Biscuits unfavorable volume/mix was due primarily to lower shipments in crackers (primarily

Wheat Thins

,

Cheese Nips, Premium and
Honey Maid

) and cookies (primarily

Newtons and Nutter Butter

). Snack nuts net revenues increased, due to favorable volume/mix, driven by higher shipments.

Segment operating income increased $122 million (16.9%), due primarily to our Cadbury acquisition (including Integration Program and acquisition-related costs), the favorable resolution of a settlement relating to
the 2009 pistachio product recall, lower manufacturing costs and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses. These favorable variances were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher marketing support costs, unfavorable
volume/mix, the 2009 gain on the divestiture of our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S., the impact of divestitures and lower net pricing.

2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues decreased $61 million
(1.2%), due to unfavorable volume/mix (1.7 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (0.7 pp). Biscuits net revenues increased, driven by higher input cost-driven pricing, partially offset by
unfavorable volume/mix (unfavorable product mix, net of higher shipments). Biscuits volume gain was due to higher shipments primarily in

Ritz

crackers,

Oreo

cookies,

Triscuit

crackers and

Chips Ahoy!

cookies. Snack bars
net revenues decreased, primarily due to volume declines in breakfast bars. Snack nuts net revenues decreased, primarily driven by lower net pricing, due to higher promotional spending, and unfavorable volume/mix reflecting lower volume due
primarily to the recall of certain products containing pistachios in March 2009.

Segment operating income increased $85 million (13.3%), due primarily
to lower costs due to the completion of the Restructuring Program, lower marketing support costs, lower manufacturing costs, higher net pricing, the gain on the divestiture of our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S. and lower other selling,
general and administrative expenses. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher raw material costs and unfavorable volume/mix (unfavorable product mix and lower shipments, including the recall of certain products containing pistachios).

Canada & N.A. Foodservice

2010 compared with 2009:

Net revenues increased $774 million (19.7%), due to our Cadbury acquisition (11.1 pp), the significant impact of favorable foreign currency (6.4 pp) and higher net
pricing (1.5 pp) and favorable volume/mix (0.8 pp). In Canada, net revenues increased, driven by our Cadbury acquisition, favorable foreign currency, higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, driven by higher shipments in its grocery, cheese and
convenient meals retail businesses. In N.A. Foodservice, net revenues increased, driven by higher net pricing and favorable foreign currency, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix (unfavorable product mix, net of higher shipments).

Segment operating income increased $120 million (26.0%), due primarily to our Cadbury acquisition(including Integration Program and acquisition-related costs),
higher net pricing, favorable foreign currency, lower manufacturing costs, favorable volume/mix and lower marketing support costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses.


2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues decreased $225 million (5.4%), due to the significant impact of unfavorable foreign currency (4.5 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (1.0 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (0.1 pp). In
Canada, net revenues increased, driven by volume gains across most retail businesses and higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency. In N.A. Foodservice, net revenues decreased, driven by lower volume, due to industry-wide
declines in restaurant traffic and the discontinuation of less profitable product lines, lower input cost-driven pricing and unfavorable foreign currency.

Segment operating income increased $67 million (17.0%), due primarily to lower costs due to the completion of the Restructuring Program, lower raw material costs and higher net pricing, partially offset by
unfavorable foreign currency, higher manufacturing costs, unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing support costs.

Kraft Foods Europe

2010 compared with 2009:

Net revenues increased $2,860 million (32.6%), due to our Cadbury acquisition (33.0 pp) and favorable volume/mix (3.9 pp; including approximately 0.6 pp from
the favorable impact of an accounting calendar change for certain European biscuits operations), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency (3.1 pp), lower net pricing (1.0 pp), and the impact of divestitures (0.2 pp). Volume/mix
gains in biscuits, chocolate, cheese and coffee, due primarily to higher shipments, drove net revenues higher. Lower net pricing was reflected across all categories, except coffee. Unfavorable foreign currency primarily reflected the strength of the
U.S. dollar against the euro, partially offset by the strength of the Swedish krona, Swiss franc, and Norwegian krone versus the U.S. dollar.

Segment
operating income increased $330 million (42.0%), due primarily to favorable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, our Cadbury acquisition (including Integration Program and
acquisition-related costs), the 2009 asset impairment charges related to certain intangible assets in the Netherlands and to write-off an investment in Norway, the 2009 loss on the divestiture of a plant in Spain and lower marketing support costs.
These favorable variances were partially offset by higher raw material costs, lower net pricing, lower reversal of prior years’ Restructuring Program costs, asset impairment charges related to intangible assets in the Netherlands and on a
biscuit plant and related property, plant and equipment in France, and unfavorable foreign currency. The accounting calendar change for certain European biscuits operations had an insignificant impact on operating income.

2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues decreased $960
million (9.9%), due to the significant impact of unfavorable foreign currency (6.7 pp), unfavorable volume/mix (2.8 pp) and the impact of divestitures (2.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (1.8 pp). Unfavorable foreign currency
primarily reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and pound sterling. In addition, volume declines in coffee, biscuits, chocolate and cheese and the discontinuation of less profitable product lines drove net revenues lower. These
unfavorable revenue drivers were partially offset by higher net pricing, primarily in chocolate, coffee and biscuits.

Segment operating income
increased $603 million (100+%), due primarily to lower costs due to the completion of the Restructuring Program (including the reversal of prior year costs), higher net pricing, the 2008 net loss on the divestitures of several operations in Spain,
2008 asset impairment charges related to certain international intangible assets and the divestiture of our Nordic and Baltic snacks operation, lower manufacturing costs and lower raw material costs. These favorable variances were partially offset
by unfavorable foreign currency, higher marketing


support costs, higher non-recurring costs associated with the Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (primarily spending on Cost Savings
Initiatives), asset impairment charges related to certain intangible assets in the Netherlands and to write off an investment in Norway, the net loss on the divestiture of a plant in Spain, unfavorable volume/mix (lower shipments, net of improved
product mix) and the impact of divestitures.

Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization

- The reorganization of our European operations to function on a
pan-European centralized category management and value chain model was completed in 2009 for our chocolate, coffee and cheese categories. The integration of our European biscuits business was principally completed in the second quarter of 2010. Our
subsidiary, Kraft Foods Europe GmbH, acts as the European Principal Company (“EPC”). The EPC manages our European categories centrally and makes decisions for all aspects of the value chain, except for sales and distribution. Our European
subsidiaries will execute sales and distribution locally, and the local production companies act as toll manufacturers on behalf of the EPC. As part of the reorganization, we incurred $21 million of severance costs and $69 million of other project
costs during 2010; $32 million of severance costs and $81 million of other project costs during 2009; and we incurred $16 million of restructuring costs, $39 million of implementation costs and $11 million of other non-recurring costs during 2008.
In 2010 and 2009, these charges were recorded within cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses The 2008 restructuring and implementation costs were included in the total Restructuring Program charges, and the other non-recurring
costs were recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. Management believes the disclosure of other project costs and other non-recurring costs provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our
Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization.

Kraft Foods Developing Markets

2010 compared with 2009:

Net revenues increased $5,657 million (71.1%), due to our Cadbury acquisition (59.8 pp), favorable volume/mix (8.5 pp; including approximately 1.9 pp from the
favorable impact of an accounting calendar change for Asia Pacific and certain operations in Latin America), and higher net pricing (3.3 pp), partially offset by the impact of divestitures (0.3 pp) and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency (0.2
pp). In Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, net revenues increased, driven by our Cadbury acquisition, favorable volume/mix across most of the region and favorable foreign currency. In Latin America, net revenues increased, driven by
our Cadbury acquisition, higher net pricing across most of the region and favorable volume/mix, primarily in Brazil, Argentina, Central America and Mexico, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency and the impact of divestitures. In Asia
Pacific, net revenues increased, due primarily to our Cadbury acquisition, favorable volume/mix driven by higher shipments across the region, primarily in China, Indonesia and Australia/New Zealand, and favorable foreign currency.

Segment operating income increased $641 million (68.5%), due to our Cadbury acquisition (including Integration Program and acquisition-related costs), favorable
volume/mix, higher net pricing and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses. These favorable variances were partially offset by higher marketing support costs, higher manufacturing costs, higher raw material costs, asset impairment
charges related to intangible assets in China and unfavorable foreign currency. The accounting calendar change for Asia Pacific and certain operations in Latin America had an insignificant impact on operating income.

2009 compared with 2008:

Net revenues decreased $292
million (3.5%), due to the significant impact of unfavorable foreign currency (12.9 pp), the absence of the 2008 favorable resolution of a Brazilian value added tax claim (0.8 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.5 pp), partially offset by higher
net pricing (8.9 pp) and favorable volume/mix (1.8 pp). In Central and


Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, net revenues decreased, driven primarily by unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by higher net pricing across most of the region and favorable
volume/mix (improved product mix, net of lower shipments). In Latin America, net revenues increased, primarily driven by higher net pricing across the region and favorable volume/mix (improved product mix, net of lower shipments), partially offset
by unfavorable foreign currency and the absence of the 2008 favorable resolution of a Brazilian value added tax claim. In Asia Pacific, net revenues increased, due to higher net pricing across most of the region and favorable volume/mix (improved
product mix, net of lower shipments), primarily in China, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency.

Segment operating income increased $121
million (14.8%), due primarily to higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix (improved product mix, net of lower shipments), lower costs due to the completion of the Restructuring Program (including the reversal of prior year costs) and 2008 asset
impairment charges related to certain international intangible assets, a juice operation in Brazil and a cheese plant in Australia. These favorable variances were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher manufacturing costs, unfavorable
foreign currency, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, higher marketing support costs and the absence of the 2008 favorable resolution of a Brazilian value added tax claim.

Venezuela -

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Venezuelan economy was classified as highly inflationary under accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Effective January 1, 2010, we began accounting for our Venezuelan subsidiaries under highly inflationary accounting rules, which principally means all transactions are recorded in U.S.
dollars. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and established a preferential exchange rate for imports of food, medicine and other essential items. Accordingly, we were required to revalue our net assets in
Venezuela. In July 2010, the Venezuelan government eliminated the secondary (or parallel) market exchange rate and replaced it with the government-regulated Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominate Securities (“SITME”) rate.
Accordingly, we were required to revalue those of our net assets in Venezuela that we maintained at the parallel rate. Then on December 30, 2010, the Venezuelan government eliminated the preferential exchange rate. Although the elimination of
the preferential exchange rate did not immediately cause us to revalue our net assets in Venezuela, it will have further impacts to our operating results in future periods. Venezuela now has two exchange rates: the official rate and the SITME rate.
We used both the official rate and the SITME rate to translate our Venezuelan operations into U.S. dollars, based on the nature of the operations of each individual subsidiary.

During 2010, we recorded approximately $115 million of unfavorable foreign currency impacts relating to highly inflationary accounting in Venezuela. This included a one-time impact to translate cash of $34 million
that we previously carried at the secondary rate. Upon the change to highly inflationary accounting in January 2010, we were required to translate those U.S. dollars on hand using the official rate. Based on the current economic structure in
Venezuela, we expect our 2011 operating results will be negatively impacted by approximately another $25 to $50 million as a result of the change to highly inflationary accounting and the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar.

Critical Accounting Policies

Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial
statements. We have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies we
used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include Kraft Foods, as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. Our domestic operating subsidiaries report results as of the last Saturday of the year, and
our international operating subsidiaries generally report results two weeks prior to the last Saturday of the year. The results of operations of the newly acquired Cadbury are reported on the last day of the calendar month.

In 2010, we changed the consolidation date for certain European biscuits operations, which are included within our Kraft Foods Europe segment, and certain
operations in Asia Pacific and Latin America, which are included within our Kraft Foods Developing Markets segment. Previously, these operations primarily reported period-end results one month or two weeks prior to the end of the period. Now our
Kraft Foods Europe segment primarily reports period-end


results two weeks prior to the last Saturday of the period, and certain of our operations in Asia Pacific and Latin America report results through the last day of the period. We believe the
change is preferable and will improve financial reporting by better matching the close dates of the operating subsidiaries within our Kraft Foods Europe segment and those operations with Asia Pacific and Latin America with our consolidated
reporting. This change resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of approximately $200 million and an insignificant impact on operating income and net income in 2010. As the impacts to prior period results were not material to our financial
results, we have not revised the prior period results for this change. Our domestic operating subsidiaries will continue to report period-end results as of the Saturday closest to the end of each period, and our international operating subsidiaries
will continue to report period-end results two weeks prior to the Saturday closest to the end of each period.

We account for investments in which we
exercise significant influence (20% - 50% ownership interest) under the equity method of accounting. We use the cost method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20% and in which we do not exercise
significant influence. Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries consists of the equity interest of noncontrolling investors in consolidated subsidiaries of Kraft Foods. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.

Use of Estimates:

We prepare our financial statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our financial statements. Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, pension and benefit
plan assumptions, lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, marketing programs and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. If actual amounts differ
from estimates, we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period in which we know the actual amounts. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had
a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. We value all our inventories using the average cost method. We also record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and
packaging changes.

Long-Lived Assets:

We review
long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an
impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on
estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

We test goodwill and
non-amortizable intangible assets at least annually for impairment. We have recognized goodwill in our reporting units, which are generally one level below our operating segments. We use a two step process to test goodwill at the reporting unit
level. The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on planned growth rates, and estimates of
discount rates and residual values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we must proceed with the second step of the process. The second step measures the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. To test
non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment, we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. Fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets is determined using our planned growth rates, and estimates of discount
rates and royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets as of October 1 each year. The basis of our valuation methodology
for estimating the fair value of our 21 reporting units is a 20-year projection of discounted cash flows that is based on our annual strategic planning process. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions
and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic conditions. For reporting units within our Kraft Foods North America and Kraft Foods Europe geographic


units, we used a market-participant, weighted-average cost of capital of 7.5% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For reporting units within our Kraft Foods Developing
Markets geographic unit, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 10.5%.

In 2010, we recorded aggregate asset impairment charges of $55 million, or $0.02
per diluted share. During our 2010 review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $13 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands and a $30 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets
in China. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we also recorded an asset impairment of $12 million on a biscuit plant and related property, plant and equipment in France. We recorded the aggregate asset impairment charges within asset impairment and
exit costs. During our 2010 impairment review, we also noted that the following five reporting units were the most sensitive to near-term changes in our discounted cash flow assumptions:

Each of our reporting units passed the first step of our
2010 annual impairment review with an estimated fair value greater than 105% of its carrying value. Looking past 2010, there are uncertainties within the five identified reporting units that could potentially require further analysis in the future
in order for us to determine if a goodwill impairment exists within any of the individual reporting units. Significant uncertainties are:

•

Across Kraft Foods North America, and specifically within our U.S. Grain Snacks reporting unit, we experienced significant input cost inflation over the past
year. In 2010 the contribution from pricing trailed input cost inflation. Consequently, in 2011 we have announced price increases on selective portions of the portfolio, while also implementing sizing changes on other portions of the portfolio. If
input costs continue to rise, as we expect, additional price increases will be required. We expect to take needed pricing actions in the midst of persistent consumer weakness; however, if we are unable to, it would decrease profitability and
adversely affect the estimated fair value of our U.S. Grain Snacks reporting unit.

•

Our U.S. Salty Snacks business grew in 2010, after experiencing two years of volume declines. Revenues and operating income grew more substantially as we
increased pricing and implemented cost saving measures. Further volume, revenue or operating income declines would adversely affect the estimated fair value of U.S. Salty Snacks reporting unit. However, as noted, we also experienced significant
input cost inflation over the past year within our U.S. Salty Snacks business. If input costs continue to rise, as we expect, additional price increases will be required. We expect to take needed pricing actions in the midst of persistent consumer
weakness; however, if we are unable to, it would decrease profitability and adversely affect the estimated fair value of our U.S. Salty Snacks reporting unit.

•

Our U.S. Confections, Asia Pacific and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa businesses compose a significant portion of our 2010 Cadbury
acquisition. As our Cadbury acquisition was only eight months prior to our annual review of goodwill on October 1, 2010, we did not expect a significant amount of excess estimated fair value over book value to be realized in such a short
period. We expect to integrate our combined businesses in these reporting units over the next two years; however, if we are unable to, it would adversely affect the estimated fair values of these reporting units.


As part of the 2009 annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $12 million charge
for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands. In addition, during 2009 we recorded a $9 million asset impairment charge to write off an investment in Norway. We recorded the aggregate charges within asset impairment and exit costs.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed the annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and recorded a $44 million charge
for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands, France and Puerto Rico. In addition, in December 2008, we reached a preliminary agreement to divest a juice operation in Brazil and reached an agreement to sell a cheese plant in
Australia. In anticipation of divesting the juice operation in Brazil, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The charge primarily included the write-off of associated intangible assets of $8 million and
property, plant and equipment of $4 million. In anticipation of selling the cheese plant in Australia, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $28 million to property, plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of 2008. Additionally, in 2008, we
divested a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and incurred an asset impairment charge of $55 million in connection with the divestiture. This charge primarily included the write-off of associated goodwill of $34 million and property, plant and
equipment of $16 million. We recorded the aggregate charges within asset impairment and exit costs.

Insurance and Self-Insurance:

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, product
liability and our obligation for employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions.

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize revenues when title and
risk of loss pass to customers, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods. Revenues are recorded net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers. Kraft Foods’
shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. A provision for product returns and allowances for bad debts are also recorded as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized.

Selling, general and administrative expenses:

Marketing
Costs -

We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. We expense
advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at
the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on
estimated volume and related expense for the full year. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.

Environmental Costs:

We are subject to laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment. We accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are adjusted as new information develops or
circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when recovery of those costs is deemed probable. At December 31, 2010, our subsidiaries were involved in 74 active actions in the
U.S. under Superfund legislation (and other similar actions and legislation) related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability.

Outside the U.S., we are subject to applicable multi-national, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. Outside the U.S., we have specific programs across our
business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements.

As of December 31, 2010, we had accrued an insignificant amount
for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a
material effect on our financial results. However, we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation actions.


Employee Benefit Plans:

We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits, consisting primarily of severance. We record
amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP. These calculations require the use of various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates
and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize any effect of the
modifications over future periods. We believe that the assumptions used in recording our plan obligations are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries. Refer to Note 11,

Benefit Plans

, to the consolidated
financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used.

We recorded the following amounts in earnings for these employee benefit plans during
the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

The 2010 net expense for employee benefit plans of $951 million increased by $164 million over the 2009 amount. The cost
increase primarily related to higher pension plan costs, including costs associated with the Cadbury acquisition and higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences. The 2009 net expense for employee benefit plans of
$787 million increased by $127 million over the 2008 amount. The cost increase primarily related to higher pension plan costs, including higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences and settlement losses for the U.S.
pension plans.

In 2010, we contributed $85 million to our U.S. pension plans and $303 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. In addition, employees
contributed $23 million to our non-U.S. plans. Based on current tax law, we plan to make contributions of approximately $540 million to our U.S. plans and approximately $400 million to our non-U.S. plans in 2011. Of our total 2011 pension
contributions, approximately $510 million will be voluntary. Our actual contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, or significant differences between expected and
actual pension asset performance or interest rates. For our U.S. qualified pension plans, we are currently only required to make a nominal cash contribution to our U.S. pension plans under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 in 2011.

We expect our 2011 net expense for employee benefit plans to remain flat, primarily due to a weighted-average decrease of 40 basis points in our U.S. discount rate
assumption partially offset by lower forecasted non-U.S. pension plan costs due to plan assumption changes.

We are freezing our U.S. pension plans for
current salaried and non-union hourly employees effective December 31, 2019. Pension accruals for all salaried and non-union employees who are currently earning pension benefits will end on December 31, 2019, and continuing pay and service
will be used to calculate the pension benefits through December 31, 2019. Our projected benefit obligation decreased $168 million in 2009, and we incurred a $5 million curtailment charge in 2009 related to the freeze. Beginning in 2010, our
annual U.S. pension plan costs decreased by approximately $40 million as a result of this change. Additionally, for salaried and non-union hourly employees hired in the U.S. after January 1, 2009, we discontinued benefits under our U.S. pension
plans, and we replaced them with an enhanced company contribution to our employee savings plan. This did not have a significant impact on our 2010 or 2009 pension plan cost.

Our 2011 health care cost trend rate assumption increased to 7.50% from 7.00% for our U.S. postretirement plans and decreased to 8.83% from 9.00% for our non-U.S. postretirement plans. We established these rates
based upon


our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward. We anticipate that our health care cost trend rate assumption will be 5.00% for U.S. plans by 2016
and 6.00% for non-U.S. plans by 2017. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following
effects as of December 31, 2010:

Our 2011 discount rate assumption decreased to 5.30% from
5.70% for our U.S. postretirement plans and decreased to 5.02% from 5.25% for our non-U.S. postretirement plans. Our 2011 discount rate decreased to 5.53% from 5.93% for our U.S. pension plans. We model these discount rates using a portfolio of high
quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations. Our 2011 discount rate assumption for our non-U.S. pension plans decreased to 5.11% from 5.21%. We developed the discount
rates for our non-U.S. plans from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year.

Our 2011 expected rate of return on plan assets decreased to 7.95% from 8.00% for our U.S. pension plans. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets
from the plan assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class. We attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we
make contributions and monthly benefit payments.

While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2011 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension
and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rate or a fifty-basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase / (decrease) in
cost, as of December 31, 2010:

Financial Instruments:

As we operate globally, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks. We monitor and
manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have
on our operating results. We maintain foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate risk management strategies that seek to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange
rates, commodity prices and interest rates, principally through the use of derivative instruments.

Financial instruments qualifying for hedge
accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature of and relationships between the hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant
characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur. If we deem it probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, we
recognize the gain or loss in earnings currently.


By using derivatives to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates, we have
exposure on these derivatives to credit and market risk. We are exposed to credit risk that the counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize our credit risk by entering into
transactions with high quality counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring
that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration greater than one year be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk is the risk that the value of the financial
instrument might be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of
derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that may be undertaken by the use of derivative instruments.

We
record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either current assets or current liabilities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge, to the
extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded each period in accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses). Gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) are
reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods in which operating results are affected by the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a fair value hedge, along with the
changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings. Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the
consolidated statements of cash flows.

We also have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed
to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We use foreign-currency-denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. We designated our euro and pound sterling
denominated borrowings as a net investment hedge of a portion of our overall European operations. The gains and losses on our net investment in these designated European operations are economically offset by losses and gains on our euro and pound
sterling denominated borrowings. The change in the debt’s fair value is recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses).

Income Taxes:

We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements when our uncertain tax positions are more
likely than not to be sustained upon audit. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

We recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced
by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Commodity Trends

We purchase large quantities of commodities, including dairy, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn products, soybean and
vegetable oils, nuts, meat products, and sugar and other sweeteners. In addition, we use significant quantities of plastic, glass and cardboard to package our products, and natural gas for our factories and warehouses. We continuously monitor
worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production.

Significant cost
items in chocolate confectionery products are cocoa and sugar. We purchase cocoa and sugar on world markets, and the prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar
relative to certain other currencies. Cocoa bean, cocoa butter and sugar costs on average were higher in 2010 than in 2009. We purchase our dairy raw material requirements, including milk and cheese, from independent third parties such as
agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. The prices for milk and other dairy products are substantially influenced by market supply and demand, as well as by government programs. Dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2010 than
in 2009. The most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans, which are purchased on world markets. Green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in
relation to certain other


currencies and consumer demand for coffee products. Green coffee bean costs on average were higher in 2010 than in 2009. Significant cost items in our biscuit and grocery products are grains
(wheat, corn and soybean oil). Grain costs have experienced significant volatility as a result of burgeoning global demand for food, livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Grain costs on average decreased from 2009 to 2010.

During 2010, our aggregate commodity costs increased primarily as a result of higher cocoa, sugar, dairy, coffee and meat costs, partially offset by
lower grain costs. For 2010, our commodity costs were approximately $1.0 billion higher than 2009, following a decrease of approximately $150 million in 2009 compared to 2008. Overall, we expect commodity costs to continue to be volatile and to
further increase in 2011.

Liquidity

We believe that our cash from operations, our existing $4.5 billion revolving credit facility (which supports our commercial paper program) and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity
to meet our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. We continue to utilize our commercial paper program and primarily uncommitted international credit
lines for regular funding requirements. We also use short-term intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on
our liquidity.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:

Operating activities provided net cash of $3.7 billion in 2010, $5.1 billion in 2009, and $4.1 billion in 2008. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2010 primarily related to estimated tax payments on the Frozen
Pizza divestiture, increased inventory levels and the unfavorable impact of acquisition-related financing fees, partially offset by increased earnings.

The increase in operating cash flows in 2009 primarily related to working capital improvements over the prior year. The capital improvements were primarily due to
improved inventory positions, partially offset by higher interest payments, principally due to the first annual payment on our euro notes. Additionally, higher earnings also attributed to an increase in operating cash flows. The increase in
operating cash flows was partially offset by higher pension contributions, driven by total voluntary contributions of $400 million that we made to our U.S. pension plans in May and December 2009.

We anticipate making U.S. pension contributions of approximately $540 million in 2011 and non-U.S. pension contributions of approximately $400 million in 2011. We
expect to fund these contributions from operations.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities:

Net cash used in investing activities was $7.5 billion in 2010, $1.2 billion in 2009, and $1.3 billion in 2008. The increase in cash used in investing activities in
2010 primarily related to the Cadbury acquisition, partially offset by higher proceeds from divestitures. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2009 primarily related to a $99 million payment made to Groupe Danone S.A. in 2008 to
refund excess cash received in the acquisition of

LU

Biscuit and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by lower proceeds from divestitures.

During 2010, we paid $9.8 billion in net cash for the Cadbury acquisition, and we received $3.7 billion in proceeds from the sale of the Frozen Pizza business and
$0.3 billion in proceeds from the divestitures in Poland and Romania. During 2009, we divested our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S., a juice operation in Brazil and a plant in Spain and received $41 million in net proceeds. During 2008, we
received $153 million in net proceeds on divestitures, primarily related to a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and four operations in Spain, and we disbursed $56 million for transaction fees related to the split-off of the

Post

cereals
business. Additionally, we paid Groupe Danone S.A. the aforementioned refund in 2008.

Capital expenditures, which were funded by operating activities,
were $1.7 billion in 2010, $1.3 billion in 2009, and $1.4 billion in 2008. Cadbury accounted for approximately $440 million of the capital expenditures in 2010. The 2010 capital expenditures were primarily used to modernize manufacturing facilities
and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2011 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.8 billion, including capital expenditures required for systems investments and the Integration Program. We expect to fund these
expenditures from operations.


Net Cash Provided by / (Used in) Financing Activities:

Net cash provided by financing activities was $4.2 billion in 2010, $3.1 billion used in 2009 and $2.1 billion used in 2008. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2010 primarily related to proceeds from
our long-term debt issuance of $9.4 billion, partially offset by $2.2 billion in dividends paid, $2.1 billion in long-term debt repayments, primarily related to our repurchase of $1.5 billion in notes through our tender offer, and $864 million
in net repayments of short-term borrowings. The net cash used in financing activities in 2009 primarily related to $1.7 billion in dividend payments, $950 million in repayments of long-term debt and $344 million in net commercial paper repayments.
Additionally, other cash used in financing activities in 2009 included $69 million in costs related to our bridge facility agreement dated November 9, 2009 (the “Cadbury Bridge Facility”). The net cash used in financing activities in
2008 primarily related to $5.9 billion in payments made on the bridge facility used to fund our

LU

Biscuit acquisition, $1.7 billion in dividend payments, $777 million in Common Stock share repurchases and $795 million in repayments of
long-term debt securities, primarily related to debt that matured on October 1, 2008, partially offset by $6.9 billion in proceeds from our long-term debt offerings.

In November 2011, $1.1 billion of our long-term debt matures. We expect to fund the repayment by re-financing all or a portion of it with long-term debt or short-term borrowings, and any remaining amounts will be
funded by cash from operations.

Borrowing Arrangements:

We maintain a revolving credit facility that we have historically used for general corporate purposes, including for working capital purposes, and to support our commercial paper issuances. Our $4.5 billion
three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility expires in November 2012. No amounts have been drawn on the facility.

The revolving credit
facility agreement includes a covenant that we maintain a minimum total shareholders’ equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses), of at least $28.6 billion. This threshold was increased by $5.6 billion to
$28.6 billion due to the equity we issued as part of our Cadbury acquisition. At December 31, 2010, our total shareholders’ equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses), was $39.7 billion. We expect to continue to
meet this covenant. The revolving credit agreement also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. However, the revolving credit facility has no other financial covenants, credit rating triggers or provisions that could
require us to post collateral as security.

In addition to the above, some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines
to meet short-term working capital needs. Collectively, these credit lines amounted to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2010. Borrowings on these lines amounted to $267 million at December 31, 2010 and $191 million at
December 31, 2009.

Cadbury maintained a three-year, £450 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that we terminated in 2010.

As part of our Cadbury acquisition, on November 9, 2009, we entered into the Cadbury Bridge Facility. During the first quarter of 2010, we
borrowed £807 million under the Cadbury Bridge Facility, and later repaid it ($1,205 million at the time of repayment) with proceeds from the divestiture of our Frozen Pizza business. Upon repayment, the Cadbury Bridge Facility was
terminated.

Long-term Debt:

Our total debt was
$28.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and $19.0 billion at December 31, 2009. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.44 at December 31, 2010 and 0.42 at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, the weighted-average term of our
outstanding long-term debt was 9.9 years.

On December 29, 2010, we repurchased $900 million principal amount of our 5.625% notes due 2011 and $600
million principal amount of our 6.25% notes due 2012, which were validly tendered pursuant to the cash tender offers we initiated in November 2010. We paid $1,596 million aggregate consideration, including accrued and unpaid interest, for the
accepted notes in December 2010.

On December 20, 2010, we repaid £77 million (approximately $119 million) of our long-term debt and on
August 11, 2010, we repaid $500 million of our long-term debt. We funded these repayments with cash from operations and short-term borrowings.


On February 8, 2010, we issued $9.5 billion of senior unsecured notes at a weighted-average effective rate of
5.364% and used the net proceeds ($9,379 million) to finance the Cadbury acquisition and for general corporate purposes. The general terms of the $9.5 billion notes are:

•

$3.75 billion total principal notes due February 10, 2020 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 5.375%. Interest is payable semiannually beginning
August 10, 2010.

•

$3.00 billion total principal notes due February 9, 2040 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 6.500%. Interest is payable semiannually beginning
August 9, 2010.

•

$1.75 billion total principal notes due February 9, 2016 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 4.125%. Interest is payable semiannually beginning
August 9, 2010.

•

$1.00 billion total principal notes due May 8, 2013 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 2.625%. Interest is payable semiannually beginning November 8,
2010.

In addition, these notes include covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt secured by liens above a certain threshold.
We also must offer to purchase these notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, if both of the following occur:

(i)

a “change of control” triggering event, and

(ii)

a downgrade of these notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody’s Investor Service, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch, Inc.
within a specified period.

We expect to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to Note 7,

Debt and Borrowing
Arrangements

, for further details of these debt offerings.

On September 3, 2009, we redeemed our November 2011, 7% $200 million debenture at
par value. Upon redemption, we recorded a loss of $14 million within interest and other expense, net which represented the write-off of the remaining discount. On November 12, 2009, we repaid $750 million in notes. These
repayments were primarily financed from commercial paper issuances.

The fair value of the long-term debt we acquired as part of our Cadbury acquisition
was $2,437 million at February 2, 2010. The acquired debt has the following terms (including U.S. dollar par amounts):

•

£77 million (approximately $123 million) total principal notes due December 20, 2010 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 4.875%.

•

C$150 million (approximately $140 million) Canadian bank loan agreement expiring August 30, 2012 at a variable interest rate. The interest rate at
December 31, 2010 was 1.573%.

•

$1.00 billion total principal notes due October 1, 2013 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 5.125%.

•

£300 million (approximately $478 million) total principal notes due December 11, 2014 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 5.375%.

•

£350 million (approximately $558 million) total principal notes due July 18, 2018 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 7.250%.

From time to time we refinance long-term and short-term debt. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the
proportionate amount of each varies as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Our Board of Directors has authorized $12.0 billion in general long-term financing authority. As a well-known seasoned issuer, we
plan to file an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC shortly after this Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed with the SEC.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than the guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.

Guarantees:

As discussed in Note 13,

Commitments
and Contingencies

, we have third-party guarantees primarily covering the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of those transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make


contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of our third-party guarantees on our consolidated balance sheet and the maximum potential
payments under these guarantees was $26 million. Substantially all of these guarantees expire at various times through 2018.

In addition, at
December 31, 2010, we were contingently liable for $445 million of guarantees related to our own performance. These include letters of credit related to dairy commodity purchases and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes,
and other letters of credit.

Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.

Aggregate Contractual Obligations:

The following table
summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2010.

(1)

Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include unamortized bond premiums or discounts.

(2)

Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our euro notes was forecasted using the euro to U.S. dollar
exchange rate as of December 31, 2010. Interest on our pound sterling notes was forecasted using the pound sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 31, 2010. An insignificant amount of interest expense was excluded from the
table for a portion of our other foreign currency obligations due to the complexities involved in forecasting expected interest payments.

(3)

Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our capital leases, including the expected cash payments of interest expense of approximately $12 million on our capital leases.

(4)

Operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.

(5)

Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and
distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services.
Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable
without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.

(6)

Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2020 of approximately $2,220
million. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2020; as such, they are excluded from the above table. There are also another $31 million of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next
5 years. In addition, the following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, income taxes, insurance accruals and other accruals. We are unable to reliably estimate
the timing of the payments (or contributions beyond 2011, in the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. We currently expect to make approximately $940 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2011. We also expect that our net
pension cost will remain unchanged at approximately $530 million in 2011. As of December 31, 2010, our total liability for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions and associated accrued interest and penalties, was $1.3 billion. We
expect to pay approximately $180 million in the next 12 months. While years 2004-2006 are currently under examination by the IRS, we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the
timing of these and other tax audit outcomes.


Equity and Dividends

Stock Repurchases:

Our Board of Directors had authorized a
$5.0 billion share repurchase program that expired on March 30, 2009. We did not repurchase any shares in 2010 or 2009.

In total, we repurchased 25.3 million shares for $777 million in 2008 under these programs. We made these repurchases
of our Common Stock in open market transactions.

Stock Plans:

In January 2010, we granted 1.7 million shares of stock in connection with our long-term incentive plan, and the market value per share was $27.33 on the date of grant. In February 2010, as part of our annual
equity program, we issued 2.5 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees, and the market value per restricted or deferred share was $29.15 on the date of grant. Also, as a part of our annual equity program, we granted
15.0 million stock options to eligible employees at an exercise price of $29.15.

During 2010, we granted an additional 0.6 million shares of
stock in connection with our long-term incentive plan and the market value per share was $29.15 on the date of grant. We also issued 1.0 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock at a weighted-average market value per restricted
or deferred share of $29.57 on the date of grant, including shares issued to Cadbury employees under our annual equity program. Additionally, we issued 3.1 million off-cycle shares of stock options at a weighted-average exercise price of $29.73
on the date of the grant, including options issued to Cadbury employees under our annual equity program.

At December 31, 2010, the number of
shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options, vesting of non-U.S. deferred shares and vesting of long-term incentive plan shares was 62.2 million or 3.6% of total shares outstanding.

In January 2009, we granted 1.5 million shares of stock in connection with our long-term incentive plan. The market value per share was $27.00 on the date of
grant. In February 2009, as part of our annual equity program, we issued 4.1 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees. The market value per restricted or deferred share was $23.64 on the date of grant. Also, as part
of our annual equity program, we granted 16.3 million stock options to eligible employees at an exercise price of $23.64.

We also issued
0.2 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2009. The weighted-average market value per restricted or deferred share was $25.55 on the date of grant. In aggregate, we issued 5.8 million restricted and deferred
shares during 2009.

In January 2008, we granted 1.4 million shares of stock in connection with our long-term incentive plan. The market value per
share was $32.26 on the date of grant. In February 2008, as part of our annual equity program, we issued 3.4 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees. The market value per restricted or deferred share was $29.49 on
the date of grant. Also, as part of our annual equity program, we granted 13.5 million stock options to eligible employees at an exercise price of $29.49.

In addition, we issued 0.2 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2008. The weighted-average market value per restricted or deferred share was $30.38 on the date of grant. In
aggregate, we issued 5.0 million restricted and deferred shares during 2008. We also granted 0.1 million off-cycle stock options during 2008 at an exercise price of $30.78. In aggregate, we granted 13.6 million stock options during
2008.


Dividends:

We
paid dividends of $2,175 million in 2010, $1,712 million in 2009, and $1,663 million in 2008. The increase of 27.0% in 2010 reflects an increase in shares outstanding due to the Cadbury acquisition and the $224 million payment of a ten pence per
share dividend that Cadbury declared and accrued on the Cadbury shares that were outstanding at the time of the acquisition. The 2.9% increase in 2009 reflects a higher dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding resulting from the
split-off of the

Post

cereals business and share repurchases. The present annualized dividend rate is $1.16 per common share. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors,
including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.

2011 Outlook

Our outlook for 2011 reflects confidence in continuing our strong business momentum in a
challenging environment of weak consumer and category growth as well as significant input cost inflation.

The company expects to deliver organic net
revenue growth of at least 5 percent, or approximately 4 percent excluding the impact of accounting calendar changes, and Operating EPS growth of 11 to 13 percent.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure “organic net revenues”
and corresponding growth ratios. The difference between “organic net revenues” and “net revenues,” which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is that organic net revenues excludes the impact of acquisitions,
divestitures and currency. Management uses organic net revenues to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have disclosed this measure so that you have the same financial data that management uses with the
intention of assisting you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance. Our management believes that organic net revenues better reflect the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our
business and provide improved comparability of results because they exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which are not under our control, and also exclude the one-time impacts of acquisitions and divestitures on net
revenues. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on net revenues. The best way that this limitation can be addressed is by using organic net revenues in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported net revenues. Our
management believes that the presentation of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more
complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting Kraft Foods than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because organic net revenues calculations may vary among other companies, the organic net revenues figures presented in the
Consolidated Results of Operations section may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of organic net revenues is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure.
You should carefully evaluate the following tables reconciling U.S. GAAP reported net revenues to organic net revenues.


We use the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure “Operating EPS” and corresponding growth ratios. The difference between
“Operating EPS” and “diluted EPS attributable to Kraft Foods from continuing operations,” which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is that Operating EPS excludes costs related to: the Integration Program;
acquisition-related costs, including transaction advisory fees, U.K. stamp taxes and the impact of the Cadbury inventory revaluation; acquisition-related financing fees, including hedging and foreign currency impacts associated with the Cadbury
acquisition and other fees associated with the Cadbury Bridge Facility; and the impact of a deferred tax charge resulting from the recently enacted U.S. health care legislation. Management uses Operating EPS to budget, make operating and strategic
decisions and evaluate our performance on a go-forward basis, and our management believes it provides improved comparability of results because it excludes certain impacts related to the Cadbury acquisition and other one-time impacts from earnings
per share. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on diluted EPS attributable to Kraft Foods from continuing operations. The best way that this limitation can be addressed is by using Operating EPS in
combination with our U.S. GAAP reported diluted EPS attributable to Kraft Foods from continuing operations. Our management believes that the presentation of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial
measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting Kraft Foods than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because Operating
EPS calculations may vary among other companies, the Operating EPS figures presented in the Consolidated Results of Operations section may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of Operating EPS is not meant
to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. You should carefully evaluate the following tables reconciling U.S. GAAP reported diluted EPS attributable to Kraft Foods from continuing operations to Operating
EPS.

(1)

Integration Program costs are defined as the costs associated with combining the Kraft Foods and Cadbury businesses, and are separate from those costs associated with the
acquisition.

(2)

Acquisition-related costs include transaction advisory fees, U.K. stamp taxes and the impact of the Cadbury inventory revaluation.

(3)

Acquisition-related financing fees include hedging and foreign currency impacts associated with the Cadbury acquisition and other fees associated with the Cadbury Bridge
Facility.

(4)

As revised to reflect Frozen Pizza as a discontinued operation.


In addition, we use the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure “free cash flow.” The difference between “free
cash flow” and “net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, is that free cash flow reflects the impact of capital expenditures. The limitation of this measure is that it
includes items that do not have an impact on our cash flow provided by operating activities. The best way that this limitation can be addressed is by using free cash flow in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported net cash provided by operating
activities.

Free cash flow is an internal, supplemental measure of our performance. Our management uses free cash flow as the primary cash flow metric
in the budgeting and forecasting processes, as it represents the controllable cash flows from operations. We believe free cash flow shows the financial health of, and how efficiently we are running, the company. We further believe that this non-U.S.
GAAP measure provides information useful to both management and investors in gaining an overall understanding of our current financial performance, and that it provides investors with financial information that most closely aligns to our internal
measurement processes.

This non-U.S. GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows generated by operating,
investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity. Because free cash flow is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, free cash flow may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures of other companies.

The table below reconciles reported net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the
periods stated.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

As we operate globally, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks.
We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these
markets may have on our operating results. We maintain foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate risk management policies that principally use derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise
from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a
party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes. Refer to Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,

and Note 12,

Financial Instruments

, to the consolidated financial
statements for further details of our foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate risk management policies and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge those exposures.

Value at Risk:

We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss
in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our foreign currency and commodity price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. We included our debt; foreign
currency forwards and futures, swaps and options; and commodity futures, forwards and options in our VAR computation. Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the
abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the computation.

We made the VAR estimates assuming normal market conditions,
using a 95% confidence interval. We used a “variance / co-variance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies. These interrelationships were determined by observing
interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The
values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity, and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.


As of December 31, 2010, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive
instruments, primarily debt, under normal market conditions and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our foreign currency and commodity instruments under normal market conditions, as calculated in the VAR model, were
(in millions):

This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse
movements in interest rates, foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by Kraft Foods, nor does it consider the effect of
favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future
changes in market rates may have on our future financial results.

Kraft Foods Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation:

Kraft
Foods Inc. was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Kraft Foods Inc., through its subsidiaries (collectively “Kraft Foods,” “we,” “us” and “our”), sells packaged food and beverage
products to consumers in approximately 170 countries.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include Kraft Foods, as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. Our domestic operating subsidiaries report results as of the last Saturday of the year, and
our international operating subsidiaries generally report results two weeks prior to the last Saturday of the year. The results of operations of the newly acquired Cadbury Limited (formerly, Cadbury plc) (“Cadbury”) are reported on the
last day of the calendar month.

In 2010, we changed the consolidation date for certain European biscuits operations, which are included within our
Kraft Foods Europe segment, and certain operations in Asia Pacific and Latin America, which are included within our Kraft Foods Developing Markets segment. Previously, these operations primarily reported period-end results one month or two weeks
prior to the end of the period. Now our Kraft Foods Europe segment primarily reports period-end results two weeks prior to the last Saturday of the period, and certain of our operations in Asia Pacific and Latin America report results through the
last day of the period. We believe the change is preferable and will improve financial reporting by better matching the close dates of the operating subsidiaries within our Kraft Foods Europe segment and those operations with Asia Pacific and Latin
America with our consolidated reporting. This change resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of approximately $200 million and an insignificant impact on operating income and net income in 2010. As the impacts to prior period results were not
material to our financial results, we have not revised the prior period results for this change. Our domestic operating subsidiaries will continue to report period-end results as of the Saturday closest to the end of each period, and our
international operating subsidiaries will continue to report period-end results two weeks prior to the Saturday closest to the end of each period.

We
account for investments in which we exercise significant influence (20%-50% ownership interest) under the equity method of accounting. We use the cost method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20% and
in which we do not exercise significant influence. Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries consists of the equity interest of noncontrolling investors in consolidated subsidiaries of Kraft Foods. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.

Use of Estimates:

We prepare our financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our financial statements.
Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, pension and benefit plan assumptions, lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, marketing programs and income taxes. We base our
estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known.
Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Foreign Currencies:

We translate the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries using average exchange
rates during each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of each period. We record currency translation adjustments as a component of equity. Transaction gains and losses are recorded in earnings and
were not significant for any of the periods presented.

Highly Inflationary Accounting:

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Venezuelan economy was classified as highly inflationary under U.S. GAAP. Effective January 1, 2010, we began accounting for our Venezuelan subsidiaries under highly
inflationary accounting


rules, which principally means all transactions are recorded in U.S. dollars. On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and established a preferential exchange rate
for imports of food, medicine and other essential items. Accordingly, we were required to revalue our net assets in Venezuela. In July 2010, the Venezuelan government eliminated the secondary (or parallel) market exchange rate and replaced it with
the government-regulated Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominate Securities (“SITME”) rate. Accordingly, we were required to revalue those of our net assets in Venezuela that we maintained at the parallel rate. Then on
December 30, 2010, the Venezuelan government eliminated the preferential exchange rate. Although the elimination of the preferential exchange rate did not immediately cause us to revalue our net assets in Venezuela, it will have further impacts
to our operating results in future periods. Venezuela now has two exchange rates: the official rate and the SITME rate. We used both the official rate and the SITME rate to translate our Venezuelan operations into U.S. dollars, based on the nature
of the operations of each individual subsidiary.

During 2010, we recorded approximately $115 million of unfavorable foreign currency impacts relating
to highly inflationary accounting in Venezuela. This included a one-time impact to translate cash of $34 million that we previously carried at the secondary rate. Upon the change to highly inflationary accounting in January, we were required to
translate those U.S. dollars on hand using the official rate.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market. We value all our inventories using the average cost method. We also record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes.

Long-Lived Assets:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated by the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 20 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 40 years.

We review long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not
be fully recoverable. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of assets held for use, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are
separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of
disposal.

Software Costs:

We capitalize certain
computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets at least annually for impairment. We have recognized goodwill in our reporting units, which are generally one
level below our operating segments. We use a two step process to test goodwill at the reporting unit level. The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value is estimated
using discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on planned growth rates, and estimates of discount rates and residual values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we must proceed with the second step of the process. The second step
measures the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. To test non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment, we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. Fair value of non-amortizable
intangible assets is determined using our planned growth rates, and estimates of discount rates and royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. Definite-lived
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.


We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets as of October 1 each
year. The basis of our valuation methodology for estimating the fair value of our 21 reporting units is a 20-year projection of discounted cash flows that is based on our annual strategic planning process. Estimating the fair value of individual
reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic conditions. For reporting units within our Kraft Foods North America and Kraft Foods Europe geographic units, we used a
market-participant, weighted-average cost of capital of 7.5% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For reporting units within our Kraft Foods Developing Markets geographic unit, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 10.5%.

Insurance and Self-Insurance:

We use a
combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and our obligation for employee healthcare benefits. Liabilities associated with the
risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions.

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods. Revenues are recorded net of
consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers. Kraft Foods’ shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. A provision for product returns and allowances for bad
debts are also recorded as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized.

Selling, general and administrative
expenses:

Marketing

- We promote our products with advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not
limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. We expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities
are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes,
advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated volume and related expense for the full year. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing
costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Advertising expense was $2,269 million in 2010, $1,581 million in 2009, and $1,598 million in 2008.

Research

- We expense costs as incurred for product research and development. Research and development expense was $583 million in 2010, $466 million in 2009, and $487 million in 2008.

Environmental Costs:

We are subject to laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment. We accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are adjusted as new information develops or
circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when recovery of those costs is deemed probable. At December 31, 2010, our subsidiaries were involved in 74 active actions in the
U.S. under Superfund legislation (and other similar actions and legislation) related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability.

Outside the U.S., we are subject to applicable multi-national, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. Outside the U.S., we have specific programs across our
business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements.

As of December 31, 2010, we had accrued an insignificant amount
for environmental remediation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a
material effect on our financial results. However, we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation actions.

Employee Benefit Plans:

We provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees. These include
pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits, consisting primarily of severance. We provide


pension coverage for certain employees of our non-U.S. subsidiaries through separate plans. Local statutory requirements govern many of these plans. For salaried and non-union hourly employees
hired in the U.S. after January 1, 2009, we discontinued benefits under our U.S. pension plans, and we replaced them with an enhanced company contribution to our employee savings plan. Additionally, we will be freezing the U.S. pension plans
for current salaried and non-union hourly employees effective December 31, 2019. Pension accruals for all salaried and non-union employees who are currently earning pension benefits will end on December 31, 2019, and continuing pay and
service will be used to calculate the pension benefits through December 31, 2019. Our projected benefit obligation decreased $168 million in 2009, and we incurred a $5 million curtailment charge in 2009 related to the freeze. Our U.S.,
Canadian, and United Kingdom subsidiaries provide health care and other benefits to most retired employees. Local government plans generally cover health care benefits for retirees outside the U.S., Canada, and United Kingdom. Our postemployment
benefit plans cover most salaried and certain hourly employees. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees.

In September 2006, new guidance was issued surrounding employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The new guidance required us to measure plan assets and benefit
obligations as of the balance sheet date beginning in 2008. We previously measured our non-U.S. pension plans (other than certain Canadian and French pension plans) at September 30 of each year. On December 31, 2008, we recorded an
after-tax decrease of $8 million to retained earnings using the 15-month approach to proportionally allocate the transition adjustment required upon adoption of the measurement provision of the new guidance.

Financial Instruments:

As we operate globally, we use
certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate risk management
strategies that seek to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates, principally through the use of derivative instruments.

Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item
being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the
various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it
must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur. If we deem it probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, we recognize the gain or loss in earnings currently.

By using derivatives to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates, we have exposure on these derivatives to credit and market risk. We are exposed to credit risk that the
counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the
amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration greater than one
year be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices
or interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that may be undertaken
by the use of derivative instruments.

We record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either current
assets or current liabilities. Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Commodity cash flow hedges

- We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. Accordingly, we use commodity forward contracts as
cash flow hedges,


primarily for meat, coffee, dairy, sugar, cocoa and wheat. Commodity forward contracts generally qualify for the normal purchase exception under guidance for derivative instruments and hedging
activities, and therefore are not subject to its provisions. We use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including dairy, coffee, cocoa, wheat, corn products, soybean oils, meat products, sugar, natural gas and
heating oil. Some of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a
commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.

For those
derivative instruments that are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we defer the effective portion of unrealized gains and losses on commodity futures and option contracts as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
earnings / (losses). We recognize the deferred portion as a component of cost of sales when the related inventory is sold. Ineffectiveness is directly recorded as a component of cost of sales. For the derivative instruments that we consider economic
hedges but do not designate for hedge accounting treatment, we recognize gains and losses directly as a component of cost of sales.

Foreign currency
cash flow hedges

- We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. These instruments include forward foreign exchange contracts,
foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, Swiss franc, pound sterling and Canadian dollar.

For those derivative instruments that are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we defer the effective portion of unrealized
gains and losses associated with forward, swap and option contracts as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) until the underlying hedged transactions are reported in earnings. We recognize the deferred portion as a
component of cost of sales when the related inventory is sold or as interest and other expense, net for our hedges of intercompany loans, when the payments are made. For those derivative instruments that we consider economic hedges but do not
designate for hedge accounting treatment, we recognize gains and losses directly as a component of cost of sales or interest and other expense, net, depending on the nature of the underlying transaction.

Interest rate cash flow and fair value hedges

- We manage interest rate volatility by modifying the repricing or maturity characteristics of certain
liabilities so that the net interest margin is not, on a material basis, adversely affected by movements in interest rates. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value. We expect
the effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation to be substantially offset by our gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to these hedged liabilities.

We use derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps that have indices related to the pricing of specific liabilities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. As a matter of policy, we do not
use highly leveraged derivative instruments for interest rate risk management. We use interest rate swaps to economically convert a portion of our nonprepayable fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. Under the interest rate swap contracts, we
agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts, which is calculated based on an agreed-upon notional amount. We also use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability
of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our future debt obligations. Substantially all of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

For those derivative instruments that are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we either record the impacts in current period earnings or defer the effective portion of unrealized gains and
losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses), depending on whether the hedging relationship satisfies the criteria for a fair value or cash flow hedge. For fair value hedges, we record both (i) the gains or
losses on interest rate swaps and (ii) the corresponding changes in fair value of the hedged long-term debt directly as a component of interest and other expense, net. For cash flow hedges, we recognize the deferred portion as a component of
interest and other expense, net when we incur the interest expense. The ineffective portion is directly recorded as a component of interest and other expense, net. For the derivative instruments that we consider economic hedges but do not designate
for hedge accounting treatment, we recognize gains and losses directly as a component of interest and other expense, net.


Hedges of net investments in foreign operations

- We have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries. The
net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We use foreign-currency-denominated debt to hedge our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. We designated our
euro and pound sterling denominated borrowings as a net investment hedge of a portion of our overall European operations. The gains and losses on our net investment in these designated European operations are economically offset by losses and gains
on our euro and pound sterling denominated borrowings. The change in the debt’s fair value is recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses).

Guarantees:

Authoritative guidance related to
guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees requires us to disclose certain guarantees and to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities. See Note 13,

Commitments
and Contingencies

for a further discussion of guarantees.

Income Taxes:

We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements when our uncertain tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that
is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

We recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary
differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

New Accounting Pronouncements:

In June 2009, new guidance
was issued on the consolidation of variable interest entities. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2010. This guidance increases the likelihood of an enterprise being classified as a variable interest entity. The adoption of this
guidance did not have a material impact on our financial results.

Note 2.  Acquisitions and Divestitures:

Cadbury Acquisition:

On January 19, 2010, we announced the terms of our final offer for each outstanding
ordinary share of Cadbury, including each ordinary share represented by an American Depositary Share (“Cadbury ADS”), and the Cadbury Board of Directors recommended that Cadbury shareholders accept the terms of the final offer. On
February 2, 2010, all of the conditions to the offer were satisfied or validly waived, the initial offer period expired and a subsequent offer period immediately began. At that point, we had received acceptances of 71.73% of the
outstanding Cadbury ordinary shares, including those represented by Cadbury ADSs (“Cadbury Shares”). As of June 1, 2010, we owned 100% of all outstanding Cadbury Shares. We believe the combination of Kraft Foods and Cadbury will
create a global snacks powerhouse and an unrivaled portfolio of brands people love.

Under the terms of our final offer and the subsequent offer, we
agreed to pay Cadbury shareholders 500 pence in cash and 0.1874 shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock per Cadbury ordinary share validly tendered and 2,000 pence in cash and 0.7496 shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock per Cadbury ADS validly tendered.
This valued Cadbury at $18.5 billion, or approximately £11.6 billion (based on the average price of $28.36 for a share of Kraft Foods Common Stock on February 2, 2010 and an exchange rate of $1.595 per £1.00).

On February 2, 2010, we acquired 71.73% of Cadbury Shares for $13.1 billion and the value attributed to noncontrolling interests was $5.4 billion. From
February 2, 2010 through June 1, 2010, we acquired the remaining 28.27% of Cadbury Shares for $5.4 billion. We had a $38 million gain on noncontrolling interest acquired and recorded it within additional paid in capital.

As part of our Cadbury acquisition, we incurred and expensed transaction related fees of $218 million in 2010 and $40 million in 2009. We recorded these expenses
within selling, general and administrative expenses. We also incurred acquisition financing fees of $96 million in 2010. We recorded these expenses within interest and other expense, net.

Cadbury contributed net revenues of $9,143 million and net earnings of $530 million from February 2, 2010 through December 31, 2010. The following unaudited pro forma summary presents Kraft Foods’
consolidated information as


if Cadbury had been acquired on January 1, 2009. These amounts were calculated after conversion to U.S. GAAP, applying our accounting policies, and adjusting Cadbury’s results to
reflect the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets had been applied from January 1, 2009, together with the consequential
tax effects. These adjustments also reflect the additional interest expense incurred on the debt to finance the purchase, and the divestitures of certain Cadbury confectionery operations in Poland and Romania, as required by the EU Commission as a
condition of our Cadbury acquisition.

(1)

The gross amount due under the receivables we acquired is $1,474 million, of which $141 million is expected to be uncollectable.

(2)

Goodwill will not be deductible for statutory tax purposes and is attributable to Cadbury’s workforce and the significant synergies we expect from the acquisition.

(3)

We acquired $10.3 billion of indefinitely lived intangible assets, primarily trademarks, and $2.6 billion of amortizable intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and
technology. Customer relationships will be amortized over approximately 13 years and technology will be amortized over approximately 12 years.

(4)

Within other current liabilities, a reserve for exposures related to taxes of approximately $70 million was established within our Developing Markets segment. The cumulative
exposure was approximately $150 million at December 31, 2010.

The above amounts represent the allocation of purchase price which was
completed during the fourth quarter of 2010.

Pizza Divestiture:

On March 1, 2010, we completed the sale of the assets of our North American frozen pizza business (“Frozen Pizza”) to Nestlé USA, Inc. (“Nestlé”) for $3.7 billion. Our Frozen
Pizza business was a component of our U.S. Convenient Meals and Canada & North America Foodservice segments. The sale included the

DiGiorno

,

Tombstone

and

Jack’s

brands in the U.S., the

Delissio

brand in
Canada and the

California Pizza Kitchen

trademark license. It also included two Wisconsin manufacturing facilities (Medford and Little Chute) and the leases for the pizza depots and delivery trucks. Approximately 3,600 of our employees
transferred with the business to Nestlé. Accordingly, the results of our Frozen Pizza business have been reflected as discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings, and prior period results have been revised in a
consistent manner.

Pursuant to the Frozen Pizza business Transition Services Agreement, we agreed to provide certain sales, co-manufacturing,
distribution, information technology, accounting and finance services to Nestlé for up to two years.


Summary results of operations for the Frozen Pizza business through March 1, 2010 were as follows:

Earnings before income taxes as presented exclude associated allocated overheads of $25 million in 2010, $108 million in 2009 and
$112 million in 2008.

The 2010 gain on discontinued operations from the sale of the
Frozen Pizza business included tax expense of $1.2 billion.

The following
assets of the Frozen Pizza business were included in the Frozen Pizza divestiture (in millions):

Post Cereals Split-off:

On
August 4, 2008, we completed the split-off of the

Post

cereals business into Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. (“Ralcorp”), after an exchange with our shareholders. Accordingly, the

Post

cereals business prior period results were
reflected as discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings. The exchange was expected to be tax-free to participating shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

In this split-off transaction, approximately 46 million shares of Kraft Foods Common Stock were tendered for $1,644 million. Our shareholders had the option to exchange some or all of their shares of Kraft
Foods Common Stock and receive shares of common stock of Cable Holdco, Inc. (“Cable Holdco”). Cable Holdco was our wholly owned subsidiary that owned certain assets and liabilities of the

Post

cereals business. In exchange for the
contribution of the

Post

cereals business, Cable Holdco issued approximately $665 million in debt securities, issued shares of its common stock and assumed a $300 million credit facility. Upon closing, we used the cash equivalent net
proceeds, approximately $960 million, to repay debt.

The

Post

cereals business included such brands as

Honey Bunches of Oats

,

Pebbles

,

Shredded Wheat

,

Selects

,

Grape-Nuts

and

Honeycomb

. Under Kraft Foods, the brands in this transaction were distributed primarily in North America. In addition to the

Post

brands, the transaction
included four manufacturing facilities, certain manufacturing equipment and approximately 1,230 employees who joined Ralcorp as part of the transaction.

Pursuant to the

Post

cereals business Transition Services Agreement, we provided certain sales, co-manufacturing, distribution, information technology, and
accounting and finance services to Ralcorp through 2009.


Summary results of operations for the

Post

cereals business through August 4, 2008, were as follows:

Other Divestitures:

The EU
Commission required, as a condition of our Cadbury acquisition, that we divest certain Cadbury confectionery operations in Poland and Romania. In 2010, we completed the sale of the assets of the confectionery operations in Poland and Romania. The
total proceeds from the divestitures were $342 million and the impacts of these divestitures were primarily reflected as adjustments to the purchase price allocations.

In 2009, we received $41 million in net proceeds and recorded pre-tax losses of $6 million on the divestitures of our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S., a juice operation in Brazil and a plant in Spain. We
recorded after-tax gains of $58 million on these divestitures, primarily due to the differing book and tax bases of our

Balance

bar operations.

In 2008, we received $153 million in net proceeds, and recorded pre-tax losses of $92 million on divestitures, primarily related to a Nordic and Baltic snacks
operation and four operations in Spain. We recorded after-tax losses of $64 million on these divestitures.

Included in the 2008 divestitures were the
following, which were a condition of the EU Commission’s approval of our Groupe Danone S.A. global

LU

biscuit business (“LU Biscuit”) acquisition:

•

We divested a biscuit operation in Spain. From this divestiture, we received $86 million in net proceeds and recorded pre-tax losses of $74 million.

•

We divested another biscuit operation in Spain and a trademark in Hungary that we had previously acquired as part of the

LU

Biscuit acquisition. As such,
the impacts of these divestitures were reflected as adjustments to the purchase price allocations.

These gains and losses on
divestitures do not reflect the related asset impairment charges discussed in Note 5,

Goodwill and Intangible

Assets.

The aggregate
operating results of the divestitures discussed above, other than the divestiture of the Frozen Pizza and

Post

cereals businesses, were not material to our financial statements in any of the periods presented. Refer to Note 16,

Segment
Reporting

, for details of the gains and losses on divestitures by segment.

Note 3.  Inventories:

Inventories at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were:


Note 4.  Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were:

Refer to Note 5,

Goodwill and Intangible

Assets, for asset impairment charges taken against property, plant and equipment.

Note 5.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, goodwill by reportable segment was:

Non-amortizable intangible assets consist principally of brand names purchased through our acquisitions of Nabisco Holdings Corp.,

LU

Biscuit and the Spanish and Portuguese operations of United Biscuits and Cadbury. Amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of trademark licenses, customer-related intangibles, process technology, license agreements and non-compete
agreements. At December 31, 2010, the weighted-average life of our amortizable intangible assets was 13.2 years.


The movements in goodwill and intangible assets were:

Changes to goodwill and intangible assets during 2010 were:

•

Acquisitions - We increased goodwill by $9,530 million and intangible assets by $12,907 million related to allocations of purchase price for our Cadbury
acquisition. We recorded $2,177 million of the acquired goodwill in our U.S. Snacks segment, $937 million in our Canada & N.A. Foodservice segment, $2,671 million in our Kraft Foods Europe segment and $3,745 million in our Kraft Foods
Developing Markets segment.

•

Divestitures - We reduced goodwill by $475 million due to our Frozen Pizza business divestiture.

•

Asset impairments - During our 2010 review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $43 million charge for the impairment of
intangible assets. We recorded the aggregate asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs.

Changes to goodwill and
intangible assets during 2009 were:

•

Divestitures - We reduced goodwill by $17 million due to the divestiture of our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S.

•

Asset impairments - During our 2009 review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded a $12 million charge for the impairment of intangible
assets in the Netherlands.

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $211 million in 2010, $26 million in 2009, and
$23 million in 2008. We currently estimate amortization expense for each of the next five years to be approximately $220 million.

Annual
Impairment Review & Asset Impairment Charges:

As a result of our 2010 annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets, we
recorded a $13 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands and a $30 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in China. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we also recorded an asset impairment of $12
million on a biscuit plant and related property, plant and equipment in France. We recorded the aggregate asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs. During our 2010 impairment review, we also noted that the following five
reporting units were the most sensitive to near-term changes in our discounted cash flow assumptions:


Each of our reporting units passed the first step of our 2010 annual impairment review with an estimated fair value
greater than 105% of its carrying value. Looking past 2010, there are uncertainties within the five identified reporting units that could potentially require further analysis in the future in order for us to determine if a goodwill impairment exists
within any of the individual reporting units. Significant uncertainties are:

•

Across Kraft Foods North America, and specifically within our U.S. Grain Snacks reporting unit, we experienced significant input cost inflation over the past
year. In 2010 the contribution from pricing trailed input cost inflation. Consequently, in 2011 we have announced price increases on selective portions of the portfolio, while also implementing sizing changes on other portions of the portfolio. If
input costs continue to rise, as we expect, additional price increases will be required. We expect to take needed pricing actions in the midst of persistent consumer weakness; however, if we are unable to, it would decrease profitability and
adversely affect the estimated fair value of our U.S. Grain Snacks reporting unit.

•

Our U.S. Salty Snacks business grew in 2010, after experiencing two years of volume declines. Revenues and operating income grew more substantially as we
increased pricing and implemented cost saving measures. Further volume, revenue or operating income declines would adversely affect the estimated fair value of U.S. Salty Snacks reporting unit. However, as noted, we also experienced significant
input cost inflation over the past year within our U.S. Salty Snacks business. If input costs continue to rise, as we expect, additional price increases will be required. We expect to take needed pricing actions in the midst of persistent consumer
weakness; however, if we are unable to, it would decrease profitability and adversely affect the estimated fair value of our U.S. Salty Snacks reporting unit.

•

Our U.S. Confections, Asia Pacific and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa businesses compose a significant portion of our 2010 Cadbury
acquisition. As our Cadbury acquisition was only eight months prior to our annual review of goodwill on October 1, 2010, we did not expect a significant amount of excess estimated fair value over book value to be realized in such a short
period. We expect to integrate our combined businesses in these reporting units over the next two years; however, if we are unable to, it would adversely affect the estimated fair values of these reporting units.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, we completed the annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and recorded a $12 million charge for the
impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands. In addition, during 2009, we recorded a $9 million asset impairment charge to write off an investment in Norway. We recorded the aggregate charges within asset impairment and exit costs.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed the annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and recorded a $44 million charge
for the impairment of intangible assets in the Netherlands, France and Puerto Rico. During our 2008 impairment review, we determined that our Europe Biscuits reporting unit was the most sensitive to near-term changes in our discounted cash flow
assumptions, as it contains a significant portion of the goodwill recorded upon our 2007 acquisition of

LU

Biscuit. In addition, in December 2008, we reached a preliminary agreement to divest a juice operation in Brazil and reached an
agreement to sell a cheese plant in Australia. In anticipation of divesting the juice operation in Brazil, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The charge primarily included the write-off of associated
intangible assets of $8 million and property, plant and equipment of $4 million. In anticipation of selling the cheese plant in Australia, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $28 million to property, plant and equipment in the fourth quarter
of 2008. Additionally, in 2008, we divested a Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and incurred an asset impairment charge of $55 million in connection with the divestiture. This charge primarily included the write-off of associated goodwill of $34
million and property, plant and equipment of $16 million. We recorded the aggregate charges within asset impairment and exit costs.


Note 6. Restructuring Costs:

Within our restructuring programs and initiatives, we include certain costs along with exit and disposal costs that are directly attributable to those activities yet they do not qualify for treatment as exit or
disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. These costs, which we commonly refer to as other project costs or implementation costs, generally include the integration and reorganization of operations and facilities, the discontinuance of certain product lines
and the incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities. Management believes the disclosure and inclusion of these charges provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our programs and
initiatives.

Integration Program

Our
combination with Cadbury has the potential for meaningful synergies and costs savings. We expect to recognize at least $750 million of cost savings by the end of the third year following completion of the acquisition. Additionally, we expect to
create revenue synergies from investments in distribution, marketing and product development. In order to achieve these cost savings and synergies, we expect to incur total integration charges of approximately $1.5 billion in the first three
years following the acquisition to combine and integrate the two businesses (the “Integration Program”).

Integration Program costs include
the costs associated with combining our operations with Cadbury’s and are separate from the costs related to the acquisition. We incurred charges under the Integration Program of $657 million in 2010. We recorded these charges primarily in
operations as a part of selling, general and administrative expenses within our Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets segments, as well as general corporate expenses.

During the second quarter of 2010, we evaluated Cadbury’s Vision into Action (“VIA”) restructuring program and began managing it within our overall Integration Program. Cadbury initiated the VIA
restructuring program in 2007 and planned to run it through 2011. Accordingly, we acquired an accrual of $228 million relating to charges taken in previous periods. In evaluating the program as part of our corporate strategies and our integration
plans, we included the remaining charges within our overall Integration Program. As we move forward on a combined company basis, we do not intend to manage these programs separately.

Liability activity for Integration Program in 2010 was (in millions):

Cost Savings Initiatives

Cost
savings initiatives generally include exit, disposal and other project costs. We incurred costs associated with our Cost Savings Initiatives of $170 million in 2010 and $318 million in 2009 and none in 2008.

•

In 2010, we primarily recorded these changes within the segment operating income of Kraft Foods Europe and Canada & N.A. Foodservice. The majority of
these charges incurred were for other project costs associated with the Kraft Foods Europe Reorganization.

•

The 2009 charges primarily included severance charges for benefits received by terminated employees, associated benefit plan costs and other related activities.
These were recorded in operations, primarily within the segment operating income of Kraft Foods Europe, with the remainder spread across all other segments.

Even though other project costs were directly attributable to exit and disposal costs, they did not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. Management believes the disclosure of
other project costs provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our Cost Savings Initiatives.


2004-2008 Restructuring Program

In 2008, we completed our five-year restructuring program (the “Restructuring Program”). The Restructuring Program’s objectives were to leverage our global scale, realign and lower our cost
structure, and optimize capacity. As part of the Restructuring Program, we:

•

incurred $2.9 billion in pre-tax charges reflecting asset disposals, severance and implementation costs;

•

announced the closure of 35 facilities and announced the elimination of approximately 18,200 positions; and

•

will use cash to pay for $1.9 billion of the $2.9 billion in charges.

In 2010, we reversed $37 million of previously accrued Restructuring Program charges, primarily related to severance. In 2009, we reversed $85 million of previously accrued Restructuring Program charges. The
reversal in 2009 related to the following:

•

We sold a plant in Spain that we previously announced we would close under our Restructuring Program. Accordingly, we reversed $35 million in Restructuring
Program charges, primarily related to severance, and recorded a $17 million loss on the divestiture of the plant in 2009. The reversal occurred in our Kraft Foods Europe segment.

•

We also reversed $50 million of previously accrued Restructuring Program charges in 2009, primarily due to planned position eliminations that did not occur.
These were primarily the result of redeployment and natural attrition. The majority of these reversals occurred in our Kraft Foods Europe segment, with the remainder spread across all other segments.

We incurred charges from continuing operations under the Restructuring Program of $989 million in 2008. Since the inception of the Restructuring Program, we have
paid cash of $1.8 billion of the $1.9 billion in expected cash payments, including $94 million paid in 2010. At December 31, 2010, we had an accrual of $125 million related to the Restructuring Program.

Restructuring Costs:

Under the Restructuring Program, we
recorded asset impairment and exit costs of $884 million during 2008. We recorded implementation costs from of $105 million in 2008. Restructuring liability activity for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was (in millions):

Our 2010 activity was related to cash outflows on prior year Restructuring Program charges and reversals relating to severance
benefits and other charges. Our prior year charges to the liability included severance benefits received by terminated employees, other costs related primarily to the renegotiation of supplier contract costs, workforce reductions associated with
facility closings and the termination of leasing agreements. We anticipate utilizing the majority of the remaining accrual during 2011.

Implementation Costs:

Implementation costs were directly
attributable to exit and disposal costs; however, they did not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. These costs primarily included the discontinuance of certain product lines, incremental expenses related to the
closure of facilities and the reorganization of our European operations discussed above. Management believes the disclosure of implementation charges provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our
Restructuring Program.


Implementation costs associated with the Restructuring Program were:

The fair values of our short-term borrowings at December 31, 2010 and 2009, based upon current market interest rates,
approximate the amounts disclosed above.

Borrowing Arrangements:

We maintain a revolving credit facility that we have historically used for general corporate purposes, including for working capital purposes, and to support our commercial paper issuances. Our $4.5 billion
three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility expires in November 2012. No amounts have been drawn on the facility.

The revolving credit
facility agreement requires us to maintain a minimum total shareholders’ equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses), of at least $28.6 billion. This threshold was increased by $5.6 billion to $28.6 billion
due to the equity we issued as part of our Cadbury acquisition. At December 31, 2010, our total shareholders’ equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses), was $39.7 billion. We expect to continue to meet this
covenant. The revolving credit agreement also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. However, the revolving credit facility has no other financial covenants, credit rating triggers or provisions that could require us to
post collateral as security.


In addition to the above, some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet
short-term working capital needs. Collectively, these credit lines amounted to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2010. Borrowings on these lines amounted to $267 million at December 31, 2010 and $191 million at December 31, 2009.

Cadbury maintained a three-year, £450 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that we terminated in 2010.

As part of our Cadbury acquisition, on November 9, 2009, we entered into an agreement for a 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility (the “Cadbury Bridge
Facility”). During the first quarter of 2010, we borrowed £807 million under the Cadbury Bridge Facility, and later repaid it ($1,205 million at the time of repayment) with proceeds from the divestiture of our Frozen Pizza business.
Upon repayment, the Cadbury Bridge Facility was terminated.

Long-Term Debt:

On February 8, 2010, we issued $9.5 billion of senior unsecured notes at a weighted-average effective rate of 5.364% and used the net proceeds ($9,379 million) to finance the Cadbury acquisition and for
general corporate purposes. The general terms of the $9.5 billion notes are:

•

$3.75 billion total principal notes due February 10, 2020 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 5.375%. Interest is payable semiannually beginning
August 10, 2010.

•

$3.00 billion total principal notes due February 9, 2040 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 6.500%. Interest is payable semiannually beginning
August 9, 2010.

•

$1.75 billion total principal notes due February 9, 2016 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 4.125%. Interest is payable semiannually beginning
August 9, 2010.

•

$1.00 billion total principal notes due May 8, 2013 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 2.625%. Interest is payable semiannually beginning November 8,
2010.

In addition, these notes include covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt secured by liens above a certain threshold.
We also must offer to purchase these notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, if both of the following occur:

(i)

a “change of control” triggering event, and

(ii)

a downgrade of these notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch, Inc.
within a specified period.

We expect to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants.

The fair value of the long-term debt we acquired as part of our Cadbury acquisition was $2,437 million at February 2, 2010. The acquired debt has the
following terms (including U.S. dollar par amounts):

•

£77 million (approximately $123 million) total principal notes due December 20, 2010 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 4.875%.

•

C$150 million (approximately $140 million) Canadian bank loan agreement expiring August 30, 2012 at a variable interest rate. The interest rate at
December 31, 2010 was 1.573%.

•

$1.00 billion total principal notes due October 1, 2013 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 5.125%.

•

£300 million (approximately $478 million) total principal notes due December 11, 2014 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 5.375%.

•

£350 million (approximately $558 million) total principal notes due July 18, 2018 at a fixed, annual interest rate of 7.250%.


At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our long-term debt consisted of (interest rates were as of December 31,
2010):

As of December 31, 2010, aggregate maturities of long-term debt were (in millions):

On December 29, 2010 we repurchased $900 million principal
amount of our 5.625% notes due 2011 and $600 million principal amount of our 6.25% notes due 2012, which were validly tendered pursuant to the cash tender offers we initiated in November 2010. We paid $1,596 million aggregate consideration,
including accrued and unpaid interest, for the accepted notes in December 2010.

On
December 20, 2010, we repaid £77 million (approximately $119 million) of our long-term debt and on August 11, 2010, we repaid $500 million of our long-term debt. We funded these repayments with cash from operations and
short-term borrowings.

On September 3, 2009, we redeemed our November 2011, 7%
$200 million debenture at par value. Upon redemption, we recorded a loss of $14 million within interest and other expense, net which represented the write-off of the remaining discount. On November 12, 2009, we repaid $750 million in
notes. This repayment was primarily financed from commercial paper issuances.

Fair Value:

The aggregate fair value of our total debt, based
on quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities, was $31,459 million at December 31, 2010 as compared with the carrying value of $28,724 million. The aggregate fair value of our total debt, based on quoted prices in active
markets for identical liabilities, at December 31, 2009, was $20,222 million as compared with the carrying value of $18,990 million.

Interest and Other Expense:

Interest and other expense
was:


There were no Class B common shares or preferred shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. At
December 31, 2010, 136,402,967 shares of Common Stock were reserved for stock options and other stock awards.

In 2010, we issued 262 million
additional shares of our Common Stock as part of the Cadbury acquisition. The issued stock had a total fair value of $7,457 million based on the average of the high and low market prices on the dates of issuance.

On August 4, 2008, we completed the split-off of the

Post

cereals business. In this transaction, approximately 46 million shares of Kraft Foods
Common Stock were tendered for $1,644 million.

On March 30, 2007, our Board of Directors had authorized a $5.0 billion share repurchase program
that expired on March 30, 2009. We did not repurchase any shares in 2010 or 2009.

In total, we repurchased 25.3 million shares for $777 million in 2008 under this program. We made these repurchases of
our Common Stock in open market transactions.


Note 9.  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Earnings / (Losses):

The components of accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) were:

Note 10.  Stock Plans:

We align our annual and long-term incentive compensation programs with shareholder returns. Under the Amended and Restated 2005 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”), we may grant to eligible
employees awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted and deferred stock units, and other awards based on our Common Stock, as well as performance-based annual and long-term incentive awards. We are authorized to
issue a maximum of 168.0 million shares of our Common Stock under the 2005 Plan. In addition, under the Kraft Foods 2006 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “2006 Directors Plan”), we may grant up to 500,000 shares
of our Common Stock to members of the Board of Directors who are not our full-time employees. At December 31, 2010, there were 73,897,346 shares available to be granted under the 2005 Plan and 326,766 shares available to be granted under the
2006 Directors Plan. Restricted or deferred shares available for grant under the 2005 Plan at December 31, 2010, were 23,599,273.


All stock awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. We have no specific policy to repurchase Common Stock to
mitigate the dilutive impact of options; however, we have historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends and other factors, to satisfy stock option exercise activity.

Stock Options:

Stock options are granted at an exercise
price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the grant date, generally become exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a maximum term of ten years. Prior to 2008, we had not
granted stock options through a broad-based program since 2002.

We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting
using a modified Black-Scholes methodology to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. The fair value of the stock options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period. We recorded compensation expense related to
stock options of $46 million in 2010, $31 million in 2009 and $18 million in 2008. The deferred tax benefit recorded related to this compensation expense was $15 million in 2010, $11 million in 2009 and $6 million in 2008. The unamortized
compensation expense related to our stock options was $60 million at December 31, 2010 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions were as
follows:

In February 2010, as part of our annual equity program, we granted 15.0 million stock options to eligible employees at
an exercise price of $29.15. We also issued 3.1 million off-cycle shares of stock options during 2010 at a weighted-average exercise price of $29.73 on the date of grant, including options issued to Cadbury employees under our annual equity
program.

In February 2009, as part of our annual equity program, we granted 16.3 million stock options to eligible employees at an exercise price
of $23.64.

In February 2008, as part of our annual equity program, we granted 13.5 million stock options to eligible employees at an exercise
price of $29.49. We also granted 0.1 million off-cycle stock options during 2008 at an exercise price of $30.78.


The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $92 million in 2010, $72 million in 2009, and $76 million in
2008. Cash received from options exercised was $134 million in 2010, $79 million in 2009, and $80 million in 2008. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from the option exercises totaled $60 million in 2010, $52 million in 2009, and
$44 million in 2008.

Restricted and Deferred Stock:

We may grant shares of restricted or deferred stock to eligible employees, giving them in most instances all of the rights of shareholders, except that they may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber the
shares. Shares of restricted and deferred stock are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. Restricted and deferred stock generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.

Shares granted in connection with our long-term incentive plan vest based on varying performance, market and service conditions. The unvested shares have no voting
rights and do not pay dividends.

The fair value of the restricted and deferred shares at the date of grant is amortized to earnings over the
restriction period. We recorded compensation expense related to restricted and deferred stock of $128 million in 2010, $133 million in 2009, and $160 million in 2008. The deferred tax benefit recorded related to this compensation expense was $39
million in 2010, $44 million in 2009, and $53 million in 2008. The unamortized compensation expense related to our restricted and deferred stock was $150 million at December 31, 2010 and is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of two years.

Our restricted and deferred stock activity for the year ended December 31, 2010 was:

In January 2010, we granted 1.7 million shares of stock in connection with our long-term incentive plan, and the market
value per share was $27.33 on the date of grant. During 2010, we granted an additional 0.6 million shares of stock in connection with our long-term incentive plan and market value per share was $29.15 on the date of grant. In February 2010, as
part of our annual equity program, we issued 2.5 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees, and the market value per restricted or deferred share was $29.15 on the date of grant. During 2010, we issued an additional
1.0 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock at a weighted-average market value per restricted or deferred share of $29.57 on the date of grant, including shares issued to Cadbury employees under our annual equity program. In
aggregate, we issued 5.8 million restricted and deferred shares during 2010, including those issued as part of our long-term incentive plan.

In
January 2009, we granted 1.5 million shares of stock in connection with our long-term incentive plan, and the market value per share was $27.00 on the date of grant. In February 2009, as part of our annual equity program, we issued
4.1 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees, and the market value per restricted or deferred share was $23.64 on the date of grant. We also issued 0.2 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock
during 2009, and the weighted-average market value per restricted or deferred share was $25.55 on the date of grant.

In January 2008, we granted
1.4 million shares of stock in connection with our long-term incentive plan, and the market value per share was $32.26 on the date of grant. In February 2008, as part of our annual equity program, we issued 3.4 million shares of restricted
and deferred stock to eligible employees, and the market value per restricted or deferred share was $29.49 on the date of grant. We also issued 0.2 million off-cycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2008, and the weighted-average
market value per restricted or deferred share was $30.38 on the date of grant. The total number of restricted and deferred shares issued in 2008 was 5.0 million.


The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted and deferred stock granted was $167 million, or $28.82
per restricted or deferred share, in 2010, $143 million, or $24.68 per restricted or deferred share, in 2009, and $151 million, or $30.38 per restricted or deferred share, in 2008. The vesting date fair value of restricted and deferred stock was
$117 million in 2010, $153 million in 2009, and $196 million in 2008.

Note 11. Benefit Plans:

Pension Plans

Obligations and Funded Status:

The projected benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of our pension plans at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were:


Certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. plans are underfunded and have accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan
assets. For these plans, the projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were:

We used the following weighted-average assumptions to
determine our benefit obligations under the pension plans at December 31:

Year-end discount rates for our U.S. and Canadian plans were
developed from a model portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations. Year-end discount rates for our non-U.S. plans (other than Canadian plans) were
developed from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets
from the plan assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.

Components of Net Pension Cost:

Net pension cost consisted of
the following for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008:

A significant portion of the 2010 increase in non-U.S. net periodic pension cost related to the Cadbury acquisition. The following
costs are included within other expenses above. Severance payments related to our Cost Savings Initiatives and Restructuring Program, and retired employees who elected lump-sum payments resulted in settlement losses for our U.S. plans of $118
million in 2010, $107 million in 2009, and $74 million in 2008. In addition, we incurred a $5 million curtailment charge in 2010 related to the divestiture of our Frozen Pizza business. Non-U.S. plant closures and early retirement benefits
resulted in curtailment and settlement losses of $11 million in 2010, $8 million in 2009, and $16 million in 2008.

For the U.S. plans, we
determine the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost using a calculated market return value that recognizes the cost over a four year period. For our non-U.S. plans, we utilize a similar approach with varying cost
recognition periods for some plans, and with others, we determine the expected return on plan assets based on asset fair values as of the measurement date.


As of December 31, 2010, for the combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, we expected to amortize from
accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) into net periodic pension cost during 2011:

•

an estimated $318 million of net loss from experience differences; and

•

an estimated $7 million of prior service cost.

We used the following weighted-average assumptions to determine our net pension cost for the years ended December 31:


We excluded plan assets of $155 million at December 31, 2010 and $172 million at December 31, 2009 from the
above tables related to certain insurance contracts as they are reported at contract value, in accordance with authoritative guidance. U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities and government bonds are primarily classified as level one and are valued
using quoted prices in active markets. Corporate bonds and other fixed income securities are primarily classified as level two and are valued using independent observable market inputs, such as matrix pricing, yield curves and indices. Pooled
funds, including assets in real estate pooled funds, are primarily classified as level two and are valued using net asset values of participation units held in common collective trusts, as reported by the managers of the trusts and as supported by
the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. Level three assets are valued using unobservable inputs that reflect the plans’ assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets, based on the best information
available. Fair value estimates are calculated by the general partners for limited partnership and private equity investments using the market approach to estimate the fair value of private investments. The market approach utilizes prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions, type of security, degree of liquidity, restrictions on the disposition, latest round of financing data, company financial statements, relevant valuation multiples and discounted cash flow
analyses. Fair value estimates are calculated for real estate investments by the investment managers using the present value of future cash flows expected to be received from the investments, based on valuation methodologies such as appraisals,
local market conditions, and current and projected operating performance. Fair value estimates are calculated for investments in hedge fund-of-funds by the investment managers using the net asset value per share of the investment as reported by the
money managers of the underlying funds. Fair value estimates are calculated for insurance contracts based on the future stream of benefit payments discounted using prevailing interest rates based on the valuation date.

Below is a rollforward of our Level 3 assets for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Our investment strategy is based on our expectation that equity securities will outperform fixed-income securities over the
long term. Accordingly, approximately 70% of our U.S. plan assets are in equity securities and approximately 30% are in fixed-income securities. The strategy uses indexed U.S. equity securities, actively managed and indexed international equity
securities and actively managed and indexed U.S. and international investment grade fixed-income securities (which constitute 90% or more of fixed-income securities) with lesser allocations to high yield fixed-income securities. The other asset
balance of our non-U.S. plans at December 31, 2010 primarily related to $374 million in hedge funds and private equity investments and $150 million in cash accounts held across various investment managers.


For the plans outside the U.S., the investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset / liability
profiles of the plans in each individual country. These specific circumstances result in a level of equity exposure that is typically less than the U.S. plans. In aggregate, the asset allocation targets of our non-U.S. plans are broadly
characterized as a mix of 41% equity securities, 46% fixed-income securities and 13% real estate / other.

We attempt to maintain our target asset
allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments.

Employer Contributions:

In 2010, we contributed $85 million to our U.S. pension plans and $303 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. In addition, employees contributed $23 million to our
non-U.S. plans. We make contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, primarily, to the extent that they are tax deductible and do not generate an excise tax liability. Based on current tax law, we plan to make contributions of approximately
$540 million to our U.S. plans and approximately $400 million to our non-U.S. plans in 2011. Of our total 2011 pension contributions, approximately $510 million will be voluntary. However, our actual contributions may be different due to
many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates.

Future Benefit Payments:

The estimated future benefit payments from our pension plans at December 31,
2010 were:


The current portion of our accrued postretirement health care costs of $217 million at December 31, 2010 and
$216 million at December 31, 2009 was included in other accrued liabilities.

We used the following weighted-average assumptions to determine
our postretirement benefit obligations at December 31:


Future Benefit Payments:

Our estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans at December 31, 2010 were:

The net postemployment costs exclude severance costs related to other Cost Savings Initiatives of $25 million in 2010 and
$125 million in 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the estimated net gain for the postemployment benefit plans that we expected to amortize from accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) into net postemployment costs during 2011 was
insignificant.


Note 12.  Financial Instruments:

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

:

The fair values of derivative instruments recorded in the consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were:

Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist of commodity forwards; foreign exchange forwards, currency swaps, and options; and
interest rate swaps.

Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract
rate multiplied by the notional amount. Foreign currency contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.


Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our
calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk.

Cash
Flow Hedges:

Cash flow hedges affected accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses), net of income taxes, as follows:

We record (i) the gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) into earnings, (ii) the
gain or loss on ineffectiveness, and (iii) the gain or loss on the amount excluded from effectiveness testing in:

•

cost of sales for commodity contracts;

•

cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses for foreign exchange contracts related to forecasted transactions, depending on the type of
transaction; and

•

interest and other expense, net for interest rate contracts and foreign exchange contracts related to intercompany loans.

We expected to transfer unrealized gains of $52 million (net of taxes) for commodity cash flow hedges and unrealized gains of $16 million (net of taxes) for
foreign currency cash flow hedges and unrealized losses of $1 million (net of taxes) for interest rate cash flow hedges to earnings during the next 12 months.


Hedge Coverage:

As of December 31, 2010, we had hedged forecasted transactions for the following durations:

•

commodity transactions for periods not exceeding the next 17 months;

•

interest rate transactions for periods not exceeding the next 32 years and 4 months; and

•

foreign currency transactions for periods not exceeding the next 13 months.

Fair Value Hedges:

The effect of fair value hedges for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was:

The hedging losses related to the Cadbury acquisition were economically offset by foreign exchange movement net gains of
$240 million on the pound sterling cash, Cadbury Bridge Facility and payable balances associated with the acquisition. For commodity contracts not designated as hedging instruments, the impact to earnings was insignificant in 2008. For foreign
exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments, we recognized net losses of $50 million in 2008. The majority of these losses were attributable to hedges of intercompany loans and were economically offset with foreign currency gains from
the intercompany receivable.


Volume:

As of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had the following notional amounts of outstanding hedges:

Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies:

Legal Proceedings:

We routinely are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inspections or
investigations, arising in the ordinary course of our business.

On February 1, 2011, we received a subpoena from the SEC. The subpoena, issued in
connection with an investigation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, primarily relates to a Cadbury facility in India that we acquired in the Cadbury acquisition and primarily requests information regarding dealings with Indian governmental
agencies and officials to obtain approvals related to the operation of that facility. We are cooperating with the U.S. government in its investigation of these matters.

While we cannot predict with certainty the results of this or any other legal matters in which we are currently involved, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of these matters will have a
material effect on our financial results.

In 2010, we recorded an insignificant amount of legal charges. In 2009, we recorded $50 million of charges
for legal matters related to certain of our European operations.

Third-Party Guarantees:

We have third-party guarantees primarily covering the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of those transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make
contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of our third-party guarantees on our consolidated balance sheet and the maximum potential payment under these guarantees was $26 million.
Substantially all of these guarantees expire at various times through 2018.

Leases:

Rental expenses were $514 million in 2010, $505 million in 2009, and $505 million in 2008. As of December 31, 2010, minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases in effect at year-end were
(in millions):


Note 14. Income Taxes:

Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and the provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2010,
2009, and 2008:

The 2010 earnings and gain from discontinued operations from the sale of the Frozen Pizza business included tax expense of
$1.2 billion. Additionally, the 2008 earnings and gain from discontinued operations from the split-off of the

Post

cereals business included a net tax benefit of $104 million.

As of January 1, 2010, our unrecognized tax benefits were $829 million. If we had recognized all of these benefits, the net impact on our income tax provision would have been $661 million. Our unrecognized tax
benefits were $1,281 million at December 31, 2010, and if we had recognized all of these benefits, the net impact on our income tax provision would have been $1,062 million. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease
by approximately $50 million during the next 12 months due to the potential resolution of certain foreign, U.S. federal and state examinations. Furthermore, we recorded $357 million of unrecognized tax benefits and $47 million of accrued
interest and penalties as part of our purchase price allocations for Cadbury. We include accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. We had accrued interest and penalties of $210 million as of
January 1, 2010 and $246 million as of December 31, 2010. Our 2010 provision for income taxes included a $3 million net benefit for interest and penalties as reversals exceeded expense accruals during the year, due to the resolution of a
federal tax audit, settlements with various foreign and state tax authorities and the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. We also paid interest and penalties of $11 million during 2010.


The changes in our unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were (in
millions):

Our 2010 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $123 million, primarily due to the favorable resolution of a
federal tax audit and the resolution of several items in our international operations, partially offset by a $137 million write-off of deferred tax assets as a result of the U.S. health care legislation enacted in March 2010.

Our 2009 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $225 million, primarily due to an agreement we reached with the IRS on specific matters related to years
2000 through 2003, settlements with various foreign and state tax authorities, the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and the divestiture of our

Balance

bar operations in the U.S.

Our 2008 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of $222 million from discrete tax events. Of the total net tax benefits, approximately $50 million
related to fourth quarter corrections of state, federal and foreign tax liabilities and a third quarter reconciliation of our inventory of deferred tax items that resulted in a write-down of our net deferred tax liabilities. The remaining net tax
benefits primarily related to the resolution of various tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. Other discrete tax benefits included the impact from divestitures of a


Nordic and Baltic snacks operation and several operations in Spain and the tax benefit from impairment charges taken in 2008. In addition, the 2008 tax rate benefited from foreign earnings taxed
below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and from the expected tax benefit of 2008 restructuring expenses. These benefits were only partially offset by state tax expense and certain foreign costs.

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following at December 31, 2010 and
2009:


We exclude antidilutive Kraft Foods stock options from our calculation of weighted-average shares for diluted EPS. We
excluded 28.5 million antidilutive options for the year ended December 31, 2010, 23.0 million antidilutive options for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 11.3 million antidilutive options for the year ended
December 31, 2008.

Note 16.   Segment Reporting:

We manufacture and market packaged food products, including snacks, beverages, cheese, convenient meals and various packaged grocery products. We manage and report operating results through three geographic units:
Kraft Foods North America, Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets. We manage the operations of Kraft Foods North America and Kraft Foods Europe by product category, and we manage the operations of Kraft Foods Developing Markets by
location. Our reportable segments are U.S. Beverages, U.S. Cheese, U.S. Convenient Meals, U.S. Grocery, U.S. Snacks, Canada & N.A. Foodservice, Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets. The results of operations from our
Cadbury acquisition are reflected within our U.S. Snacks, Canada & N.A. Foodservice, Kraft Foods Europe and Kraft Foods Developing Markets segments.

Management uses segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends.
Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), certain components of our U.S. pension plan cost (which is a component of cost of sales and selling, general and
administrative expenses), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) and amortization of intangibles for all periods presented. We exclude certain components of our U.S. pension plan cost from
segment operating income because we centrally manage pension plan funding decisions and the determination of discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions. Therefore, we allocate only the service cost
component of our U.S. pension plan expense to segment operating income. We exclude the unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Once
realized, the gains and losses on hedging activities are recorded within segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, we do not present these items by segment because they are excluded
from the segment profitability measure that management reviews. We use the same accounting policies for the segments as those described in Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

statements.


Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. We acquired Cadbury Limited (formerly, Cadbury plc) (“Cadbury”) in the first quarter of 2010, and it represented approximately 32% of our total assets as of
December 31, 2010. As the acquisition occurred in the first quarter of 2010, the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting does not include Cadbury. This exclusion is in accordance with the
SEC’s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from our scope in the year of acquisition. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2010, and noted the following significant changes.

•

In 2008, we began implementing “Catalyst,” a business initiative to simplify and harmonize our systems processes. This multi-year program includes the
delivery of SAP enterprise software applications and business solutions. During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, we transitioned some of our processes and procedures into the SAP control environment within Kraft Foods North America and
Kraft Foods Developing Markets. As we migrate to the SAP environment, our management ensures that our key controls are mapped to applicable SAP controls, tests transition controls prior to the migration date of those controls, and as appropriate,
maintains and evaluates controls over the flow of information to and from SAP. We expect the transition period to be completed in 2011.

We determined that there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2010, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America;

•

provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect
on the consolidated financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and
internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2010. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

Management reviewed the results of our assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on this assessment, management determined
that, as of December 31, 2010, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent
registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements included in this report, has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.

February 28, 2011


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Kraft Foods Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, equity and cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Kraft Foods Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in the Report of Management on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting management has excluded Cadbury Limited (formerly, Cadbury plc) (“Cadbury”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 because it was acquired by the
Company in a purchase business combination during 2010. We have also excluded Cadbury from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Cadbury is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent 32% and 19%,
respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.
