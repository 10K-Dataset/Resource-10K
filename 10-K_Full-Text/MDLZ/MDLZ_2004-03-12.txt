PART I

Item 1.

Business.

(a)    General Development of Business

General

Kraft Foods Inc. ("Kraft") was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. On December 11, 2000, Kraft acquired all of the outstanding
shares of Nabisco Holdings Corp. ("Nabisco"). Kraft, through its subsidiaries (Kraft and its subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as the "Company"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of
branded foods and beverages in the United States, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa.

Prior
to June 13, 2001, Kraft was a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. On June 13, 2001, Kraft completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of 280,000,000
shares of its Class A common stock at a price of $31.00 per share. The IPO proceeds, net of the underwriting discount and expenses, of $8.4 billion were used to retire a portion of an
$11.0 billion long-term note payable to Altria Group, Inc., incurred in connection with the acquisition of Nabisco. After the IPO, Altria Group, Inc. owned
approximately 83.9% of the outstanding shares of Kraft's capital stock through its ownership of 49.5% of Kraft's Class A common stock and 100% of Kraft's Class B common stock. Kraft's
Class A common stock has one vote per share, while its Class B common stock has ten votes
per share. At December 31, 2003, Altria Group, Inc. held 97.9% of the combined voting power of Kraft's outstanding capital stock and owned approximately 84.6% of the outstanding shares
of Kraft's capital stock.

In
January 2004, the Company announced a three-year restructuring program with the objectives of leveraging the Company's global scale, realigning and lowering the
cost structure, and optimizing capacity utilization. As part of this program, the Company anticipates the exit or closing of up to twenty plants and the elimination of approximately 6,000 positions.
Over the next three years, the Company expects to incur up to $1.2 billion in pre-tax charges, reflecting asset disposals, severance and other implementation costs, including an
estimated range of $750 million to $800 million in 2004. Approximately one-half of the pre-tax charges are expected to require cash payments. In addition, the
Company expects to spend approximately $140 million in capital over the next three years to implement the program, including approximately $50 million in 2004. Cost savings as a result
of this program in 2004 are expected to be approximately $120 million to $140 million and are anticipated to reach annual cost savings of approximately $400 million by 2006, all
of which are expected to be used in supporting brand-building initiatives.

Source of Funds—Dividends

Because Kraft is a holding company, its principal source of funds is dividends from its subsidiaries. Kraft's principal wholly owned subsidiaries currently are
not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock.

(b)    Financial Information About Industry Segments

The Company conducts its global business through its subsidiaries: Kraft Foods North America, Inc. ("Kraft Foods North America") and Kraft Foods
International, Inc. ("Kraft Foods International"). The Company has operations in 68 countries and sells its products in more than 150 countries. Kraft Foods North America operates in the United
States, Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico and manages its operations principally by product category, while Kraft Foods International manages its operations by geographic region. During 2003, 2002 and
2001, Kraft Foods North America's segments were Cheese, Meals and Enhancers; Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery; Beverages, Desserts and Cereals; and Oscar Mayer and Pizza. Kraft Foods North America's
food service business within the United States and


its
businesses in Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico were reported through the Cheese, Meals and Enhancers segment. Kraft Foods International's segments were Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Latin
America and Asia Pacific.

During
January 2004, the Company announced a new global organizational structure, which will result in new segments for financial reporting purposes. Beginning in 2004, the
Company's new segments will be U.S. Beverages & Grocery; U.S. Snacks; U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America Foodservice; U.S. Convenient Meals; Europe, Middle East & Africa; and
Latin America & Asia Pacific. The new segment structure in North America reflects a shift of certain divisions and brands between segments to align businesses with consumer targets. Results for
the Mexico and Puerto Rico businesses will be reported in the Latin America & Asia Pacific segment.

The
Company's 2003, 2002 and 2001 results by segment are discussed herein under the reporting structure in place during 2003. The Company will report financial results in the new segment
structure beginning with the results for the first quarter of 2004, and historical amounts will be restated.

Net
revenues and operating companies income* attributable to each segment (together with a reconciliation to consolidated operating income) for each of the last three years are set forth
in Note 13 to the Company's consolidated financial statements and are incorporated herein by reference to the 2003 Annual Report.

The
relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows:

During
the first quarter of 2003, the Company transferred management responsibility of its Canadian Biscuits and Pet Snacks operations from the Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery segment
to the Cheese, Meals and Enhancers segment, which contains the Company's other Canadian businesses. Accordingly, all prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the transfer.

*

The
Company's management uses operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment
performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze business performance and trends of the various business segments.

Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials

Kraft Foods North America's products are generally sold to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors,
convenience stores, gasoline stations and other retail food outlets. In general, the retail trade for food products is consolidating. Food products are distributed through distribution centers,
satellite warehouses, company-operated and public cold-storage facilities, depots and other facilities. Most distribution in North America is in the form of warehouse delivery, but
biscuits and frozen pizza are distributed through two direct-store-delivery systems. Selling efforts are supported by national and regional advertising on television and radio, as well as outdoor
media such as billboards and in magazines and newspapers, as well as by sales promotions, product displays, trade incentives, informative material offered to customers and other promotional
activities. Subsidiaries and affiliates of Kraft Foods International sell their food products primarily in the same manner and also engage the services of independent sales offices and agents.

Kraft
Foods North America, Kraft Foods International and their subsidiaries are subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of their business. Competitors include large national and
international companies and numerous local and regional companies. Some competitors may have different profit objectives and some international competitors may be more or less susceptible to currency
exchange rates. In addition, certain international competitors benefit from government subsidies. Products of Kraft Foods North America and Kraft Foods International also compete with generic products
and private-label products of food retailers, wholesalers and cooperatives. Kraft Foods North America, Kraft Foods International and their subsidiaries compete primarily on the basis of product
quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. Substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to maintain or improve a brand's market position
or to introduce a new product.

Kraft
Foods North America, Kraft Foods International and their subsidiaries are major purchasers of milk, cheese, nuts, green coffee beans, cocoa, corn products, wheat, rice, pork,
poultry, beef, vegetable oil, and sugar and other sweeteners. They also use significant quantities of glass, plastic and cardboard to package their products. They continuously monitor worldwide supply
and cost trends of these commodities to enable them to take appropriate action to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production.

Kraft
Foods North America, Kraft Foods International and their subsidiaries purchase a substantial portion of their dairy raw material requirements, including milk and cheese, from
independent third


parties
such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. The prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by government programs, as well as by market
supply and demand. Dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2003 than those seen in 2002.

The
most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans, which are purchased on world markets. Green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of
supply, trade agreements among producing and consuming nations, the unilateral policies of the producing nations, changes in the value of the United States dollar in relation to certain other
currencies and consumer demand for coffee products. In 2003, coffee bean costs on average were higher than in 2002. A significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa, which is
purchased on world markets, and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the British pound sterling and the United States dollar relative to
certain other currencies. In 2003, cocoa bean costs on average were higher than in 2002.

The
prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in the products of Kraft Foods North America, Kraft Foods International and their subsidiaries generally reflect
external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and the effects of
governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, the Company believes such raw materials to be in
adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. The Company uses hedging techniques to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in its principal raw materials. However, it does not
fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect the Company or its subsidiaries from increases in specific raw material costs.


Regulation

All of Kraft Foods North America's United States food products and packaging materials are subject to regulations administered by the Food and Drug Administration
("FDA") or, with respect to products containing meat and poultry, the United States Department of Agriculture. Among other things, these agencies enforce statutory prohibitions against misbranded and
adulterated foods, establish safety standards for food processing, establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain foods, establish standards of identity for certain foods, determine
the safety of food additives and establish labeling standards and nutrition labeling requirements for food products.

In
addition, various states regulate the business of Kraft Foods North America's operating units by licensing dairy plants, enforcing federal and state standards of identity for selected
food products, grading food products, inspecting plants, regulating certain trade practices in connection with the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products.

Many
of the food commodities on which Kraft Foods North America's United States businesses rely are subject to governmental agricultural programs. These programs have substantial effects
on prices and supplies and are subject to Congressional and administrative review.

Almost
all of the activities of the Company's food operations outside of the United States are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to Kraft Foods North
America's United States businesses and, in some cases, international regulatory provisions, such as those of the European Union relating to labeling, packaging, food content, pricing, marketing and
advertising and related areas.

The
European Union and certain individual countries require that food products containing genetically modified organisms or classes of ingredients derived from them be labeled
accordingly. Other countries may adopt similar regulations. The FDA has concluded that there is no basis for similar mandatory labeling under current United States law.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

During 2003, the Company acquired a biscuits business in Egypt and trademarks associated with a small U.S.-based natural foods business. The total cost of these
and other smaller acquisitions was $98 million. During 2002, the Company acquired a snacks business in Turkey and a biscuits business in Australia. The total cost of these and other smaller
acquisitions was $122 million. During 2001, the Company purchased coffee businesses in Romania, Morocco and Bulgaria and also acquired confectionery businesses in Russia and Poland. The total
cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $194 million.

During
2003, the Company sold a European rice business and a branded fresh cheese business in Italy. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses during 2003 were
$96 million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $31 million. During 2002, the Company sold several small North American food businesses, some of which were
previously classified as businesses held for sale. The net revenues and operating results of the businesses held for sale, which were not significant, were excluded from the Company's consolidated
statements of earnings, and no gain or loss was recognized on these sales. In addition, the Company sold its Latin American yeast and industrial bakery ingredients business for $110 million and
recorded a pre-tax gain of $69 million. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses during 2002 were $219 million, on which the Company recorded
pre-tax gains of $80 million. During 2001, the Company sold several small food businesses. The aggregate proceeds received in these transactions were $21 million, on which
the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $8 million.

The
operating results of these acquisitions and divestitures were not material to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods
presented.


Other Matters

Customers

For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company's five largest customers accounted for approximately 27% of its net revenues, while the Company's ten
largest customers accounted for approximately 37% of its net revenues. One of the Company's customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 12% of net revenues for
2003.

Employees

At December 31, 2003, the Company employed approximately 106,000 people worldwide. Approximately 30% of the Company's 48,000 employees in the United States
are represented by labor unions. Most of the unionized workers at the Company's domestic locations are represented under contracts with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers
International Union; the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union; and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. These contracts expire at various times throughout the next several
years. Outside the United States, labor unions or workers' councils represent approximately 60% of the Company's 58,000 employees. The Company's business units are subject to a number of laws and
regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. These laws and regulations are specific to the location of each enterprise. In addition, in accordance with European Union
requirements, Kraft Foods International has established European Works Councils composed of management and elected members of its workforce. The Company believes that its relations with employees and
their representative organizations are good.

In
January 2004, the Company announced a three-year restructuring program. Under this program, the Company anticipates the elimination of approximately 6,000
positions.

Research and Development

The Company pursues four objectives in research and development: uncompromising product safety and quality; growth through new products; superior consumer
satisfaction; and reduced costs.

The
Company's research and development resources include more than 2,000 food scientists, chemists and engineers, deployed primarily in five key technology centers: East Hanover, New
Jersey; Glenview, Illinois; Tarrytown, New York; Banbury, United Kingdom; and Munich, Germany. These technology centers are equipped with pilot plants and
state-of-the-art instruments. Research and development expense was $380 million in 2003, $360 million in 2002 and $358 million in 2001.

Trademarks and Intellectual Property

Trademarks are of material importance to the Company's businesses and are protected by registration or otherwise in the United States and most other markets where
the related products are sold. The Company has from time to time granted various parties exclusive or non-exclusive licenses to use one or more of its trademarks in particular locations.
The Company does not believe that these licensing arrangements have had a material effect on the conduct of its business or operating results.

Some
of the Company's products are sold under brands that have been licensed from others on terms that are generally renewable at the Company's discretion. These licensed brands include

Starbucks

bagged
coffee for sale in United States grocery stores,

Capri Sun

aseptic juice drinks for
sale in North America,

Taco Bell Home Originals

Mexican style food products for sale in United States grocery stores,

California
Pizza Kitchen

frozen pizzas for sale in grocery stores in the United States and Canada,

Pebbles

ready-to-eat cereals and

Breyers

yogurt products.

Similarly,
the Company owns thousands of patents worldwide, and the patent portfolio as a whole is material to the Company's business; however, no one patent or group of related patents
is material to the


Company.
In addition, the Company has proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Seasonality

Demand for certain of the Company's products may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other annual events. Due to the offsetting nature of demands for
the Company's product portfolio, however, sales of the Company's products are generally evenly balanced throughout the year.

Environmental Regulation

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise
related to environmental protection, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as "Superfund"), which imposes joint and several liability on each responsible party. In 2003, subsidiaries of the Company were involved in 103 active Superfund
and other actions in the United States related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which the Company retains liability.

Outside
the United States, the Company is subject to applicable multi-national, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the host countries in which the Company does
business. The Company has specific programs across its international business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements.

Although
it is not possible to predict precisely the estimated costs for such environmental-related expenditures, compliance with such laws and regulations, including the payment of any
remediation costs and the making of such expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, capital expenditures, financial
position, earnings, cash flows or competitive position.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in the Company's filings
with the SEC and in its reports to shareholders. One can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as "strategy," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will,"
"continues," "estimates," "intends," "projects," "goals," "targets" and other words of similar meaning. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current
facts. These statements are based on our assumptions and estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties. In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995, the Company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement made by
or on behalf of the Company; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements.

Each
of the Company's segments is subject to intense competition, changes in consumer preferences and demand for its products, the effects of changing prices for its raw materials and
local economic and market conditions. Their results are dependent upon their continued ability to promote brand equity successfully, to anticipate and respond to new consumer trends, to develop new
products and markets, to broaden brand portfolios, to compete effectively with lower priced products in a consolidating environment at the retail and manufacturing levels and to improve productivity.
The Company's results are also dependent on its ability to consummate and successfully integrate acquisitions and to realize the cost savings and improved asset utilization contemplated by its
restructuring program. In addition, the Company is subject to the effects of foreign economies, currency movements, fluctuations in levels of customer inventories and credit and other business risks
related to its customers operating in a challenging economic and competitive environment. The Company's


results
are affected by its access to credit markets, borrowing costs and credit ratings, which may in turn be influenced by the credit ratings of Altria Group, Inc. The Company's benefit
expense is subject to the investment performance of pension plan assets, interest rates and cost increases for medical benefits offered to employees and retirees. The food industry continues to be
subject to recalls if products become adulterated or misbranded, liability if product consumption causes injury, ingredient disclosure and labeling laws and regulations and the possibility that
consumers could lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products. The food industry is also subject to consumer concerns regarding genetically modified organisms and the health
implications of obesity and trans-fatty acids. Developments in any of these areas, which are more fully described elsewhere in this document and which descriptions are incorporated into this section
by reference, could cause the Company's results to differ materially from results that have been or may be projected by or on behalf of the Company. The Company cautions that the foregoing list of
important factors is not exclusive. Any forward-looking statements are made as of the date of the document in which they appear. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement
that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company.

(d)    Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales

The amounts of net revenues, total assets and long-lived assets attributable to each of the Company's geographic segments for each of the last three
fiscal years are set forth in Note 13 to the Company's consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference to the 2003 Annual Report.

Kraft's
subsidiaries export coffee products, grocery products, cheese and processed meats. In 2003, exports from the United States by these subsidiaries amounted to approximately
$99 million.

Item 2.

Properties.

The Company has 197 manufacturing and processing facilities worldwide. In North America, the Company has 90 facilities, and outside of North America there are 107
facilities located in 43 countries. These manufacturing and processing facilities are located throughout the following territories:

Territory

United States


Canada


Mexico

Total


The
Company owns 188 and leases nine of these manufacturing and processing facilities. All of the Company's plants and properties are maintained in good condition, and the Company
believes that they are suitable and adequate for its present needs.

As
of December 31, 2003, the Company's distribution facilities consisted of 500 distribution centers and depots worldwide. In North America, the Company had 370 distribution
centers and depots, more than 75% of which support the Company's direct-store-delivery systems. Outside North America, the Company had 130 distribution centers in 41 countries. The Company owns 60 of
these distribution centers and two of these depots and leases 260 of these distribution centers and 178 of these depots. The Company believes that all of these facilities are in good condition and
have sufficient capacity to meet the Company's distribution needs for the foreseeable future.

In
January 2004, the Company announced a three-year restructuring program. As part of this program, the Company expects to exit or close up to 20 of its production
facilities worldwide.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is party to a variety of legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business, including the matters discussed below. While the results of
litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

On
January 2, 2004, the Canada Border Services Agency ("CBSA"), an agency of the Canadian government, announced the initiation of an investigation into an allegation of injurious
dumping by Kraft Foods North America of frozen self-rising crust pizza from the United States following a complaint filed by McCain Foods Limited, which claims that the alleged dumping is
materially injuring Canadian production by causing price erosion, price suppression, lost sales and reduced profits. Kraft Canada is the major importer of frozen self-rising crust pizza
from the United States, which it sells under the brand name

Delissio

. On the basis of McCain's allegation, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal
("CITT") issued a preliminary finding that there was a reasonable indication of injury in the Canadian market. Following this finding, the CBSA must make a preliminary determination as to whether
dumping has occurred. This is currently scheduled for April 1, 2004, but may be extended by an additional 45 days. If the CBSA were to conclude on a preliminary basis that dumping has
occurred, the CITT would commence a formal inquiry into whether the imports are in fact materially injuring Canadian production.


The
CITT would be required to hold hearings and make a final determination as to material injury, if any, by the end of July 2004, subject to the possible 45-day extension. The Company is
vigorously contesting McCain's allegations of dumping and material injury. If material injury is found by the CITT, dumping duties will be assessed against imports of frozen self-rising
crust pizza from the United States for an initial period of five years. The dumping duties will be based upon a comparison of normal values determined by the CBSA for Kraft Foods North America against
Kraft Foods North America's export prices. Frozen pizzas are currently imported into Canada from the United States on a duty-free basis under the terms of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.

In
November 2003, the Company was advised by the Fort Worth District Office of the SEC that the staff is considering recommending that the SEC bring a civil injunctive action
against the Company charging it with aiding and abetting Fleming Companies ("Fleming") in violations of the securities laws. District staff alleges that a Company employee, who received a similar
notice, signed documents requested by Fleming, which Fleming used in order to accelerate its revenue recognition. The notice does not contain any allegations or statements regarding the Company's
accounting for transactions with Fleming. The Company believes that it properly recorded the transactions in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company
has submitted a response to the staff indicating why it believes that no enforcement action should be brought against it. The Company has cooperated fully with the SEC with respect to this matter and
the SEC's investigation of Fleming.

In
October 2002, Mr. Mustapha Gaouar filed suit in the Commercial Court of Casablanca against the Company and Mr. Omar Berrada claiming damages of approximately
$31 million arising from a non-compete undertaking signed by Mr. Gaouar allegedly under duress. The non-compete clause was contained in an agreement concluded in
1986 between Mr. Gaouar and Mr. Berrada acting for himself and for his group of companies, including Les Cafes Ennasr (renamed Kraft Foods Maroc), which was acquired by the Company from
Mr. Berrada in 2001. In June 2003, the court issued a preliminary judgment against Kraft Foods Maroc and Mr. Berrada holding that Mr. Gaouar is entitled to damages for
being deprived of the possibility of engaging in coffee roasting from 1986 due to such non-compete undertaking. At that time, the court appointed two experts to assess the amount of
damages to be awarded. In
December 2003, these experts delivered a report concluding that they could see no evidence of loss suffered by Mr. Gaouar. Mr. Gaouar has asked the court that this report be set
aside and new court experts be appointed. The Company believes that it has various grounds for appeal of the original judgment and intends to pursue such an appeal after damages have been finally
assessed. The existence of the claims of Mr. Gaouar was not disclosed by Mr. Berrada at the time of the Company's acquisition of Kraft Foods Maroc in 2001. As a result, in the event that
the Company is ultimately found liable for damages to plaintiff in this case, the Company believes that it may have claims against Mr. Berrada for recovery of all or a portion of the amount.

In
May 2002, the Company was served with a lawsuit filed in California by the American Environmental Safety Institute against several major chocolate manufacturers alleging that
the defendants' chocolate products contain "potentially dangerous levels of lead and cadmium." The suit alleged that these levels, which are not disclosed on the product labels, are a violation of
California's

Proposition 65

, which requires a warning on products containing chemicals "known to the State" to be carcinogens or reproductive toxicants.
In December 2003, a settlement was reached, and all claims in the case were dismissed with prejudice. The settlement amount was not material to the Company.

Environmental Matters

In May 2001, the State of Ohio notified the Company that it may be subject to an enforcement action for alleged past violations of the Company's wastewater
discharge permit at its production facility in Farmdale, Ohio. The State has offered to attempt to negotiate a settlement of this matter, and the parties currently are involved in settlement
negotiations.


The
Company is potentially liable for certain environmental matters arising from the operations of Nabisco's former wholly owned subsidiary, Rowe Industries. Rowe operated a small engine
manufacturing facility in Sag Harbor, New York in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s that used various solvents. About 20 homes downgradient from the site were connected to public drinking water in the
mid-1980s after solvents were detected in their individual wells. Since 1996, three toxic tort cases have been brought against Nabisco in New York state court, collectively by or on behalf
of approximately 80 individuals, including 17 minors. The first case was filed on March 6, 1996, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York and was subsequently dismissed by the trial court.
That decision was affirmed on appeal. The other two cases were both filed on January 3, 2000, also in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. That court granted defendant's summary judgment
motion as to all but one of the plaintiffs in each of the remaining cases, and the plaintiffs have now withdrawn their appeal of this ruling. In August 2002, the court entered summary judgment
against the remaining two plaintiffs and dismissed all of their remaining claims. These two plaintiffs appealed that judgment, and in December 2003, the Appellate Division upheld the lower
court's ruling dismissing all claims. The time to seek leave to appeal or to move
for reconsideration expired on January 21, 2004, with no action taken by the two remaining plaintiffs, and the cases are now final and fully resolved in the Company's favor.
