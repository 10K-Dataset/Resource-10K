PART I

Item 1. Business.

General

We are one of the world’s largest snack companies with global net revenues of $25.9 billion and net earnings of $2.9 billion in 2017. We manufacture and
market delicious snack food and beverage products for consumers in approximately 160 countries around the world. Our portfolio includes many iconic snack brands including

Nabisco

,

Oreo, LU

and

belVita

biscuits

; Cadbury,
Milka, Cadbury Dairy Milk

and

Toblerone

chocolate;

Trident

gum;

Halls

candy and

Tang

powdered beverages.

We are proud members of
the Standard and Poor’s 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Our Common Stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “MDLZ.” We have been incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia since 2000.

Strategy

We intend to leverage our core strengths, including our advantaged
geographic footprint, market leadership positions and portfolio of iconic brands and innovation platforms, to grow our people, grow our business and grow our impact.

•

Grow our People:

We strive to inspire our people to engage in challenging and rewarding career experiences and to contribute their talent to create a great place to work. We collaborate globally, scale ideas
quickly and develop world-class capabilities. Our culture is fast-moving, bold, innovative and accountable, reflecting the traits and skills necessary to thrive in a competitive global marketplace. To support and build on the success of our people
in a continually-evolving business environment, we invest in our people and their development, foster respect for one another, celebrate diversity and commit to authenticity at every level. We also work to create an environment in which our people
can demonstrate innovative and courageous leadership to make a difference in every role they play in the Company. As reflected in our actions and our investments in our people, we value their contributions and celebrate their success.

•

Grow our Business:

We aim to deliver strong, profitable long-term growth by accelerating our core snacks business and expanding the reach of our Power Brands globally. Leveraging our Power Brands (including

Oreo, LU

and

belVita

biscuits;

Milka, Cadbury Dairy Milk

and

Toblerone

chocolate;

Trident

gum and

Halls

candy) and our innovation platforms, we plan to innovate boldly and connect with our consumers wherever
they are. As consumers seek out foods that have better well-being credentials, we are actively evolving our portfolio by expanding the well-being brands in our portfolio, enhancing the nutrition and ingredient profile of our Power Brands and
inspiring consumers to snack mindfully by providing more portion control treats. We plan to reach consumers in new markets around the world, using both traditional and digital channels. While we already have a strong presence in modern grocery
stores, we are increasing our presence in higher growth

non-grocery

channels, including

e-commerce.

To fuel these investments, we have been working to optimize our cost
structure. These efforts include reinventing our supply chain, including adding and upgrading to more efficient production lines, while reducing the complexity of our product offerings, ingredients and number of suppliers. We also continue to
aggressively manage our overhead costs. We have embedded

zero-based

budgeting practices across the organization to identify potential areas of cost reductions and capture and sustain savings within our ongoing
operating budgets. Through these actions, we are leveraging our brands, platforms and capabilities to drive long-term value and return on investment for our shareholders.

•

Grow our Impact:

We are focused on helping people snack in balance and enjoy life with products that are safely and sustainably sourced, produced and delivered. We are committed to driving business growth while
making positive change in the world. We use our global scale and focus where we can have the greatest impact on people and planet - including communities, safety, sustainability and well-being snacks. This includes reducing our environmental
footprint, empowering farmers in our supply chain and supporting the communities where our snacks are sourced, produced and sold.



Reportable Segments

Our
operations and management structure are organized into four reportable operating segments:

•

Latin America

•

Asia, Middle East, and Africa (“AMEA”)

•

Europe

•

North America

On October 1, 2016, we integrated our Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EEMEA”)
operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments to further leverage and optimize the operating scale built within the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined
within our Europe region, while the remaining Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific region to form the AMEA operating segment. We have reflected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented.

We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth
opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.

We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze
segment performance and trends. For a definition and reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated

pre-tax

earnings as well as other information on our segments, see Note 16,

The deconsolidation of our global coffee business in 2015, the deconsolidation of our Venezuela operations beginning with our 2016

global coffee business deconsolidation, see the discussions under

and

.

Customers

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2017. Our five largest customers accounted for 15.6% and our ten
largest customers accounted for 21.4% of net revenues from continuing operations in 2017.

Seasonality

Demand for our products is generally balanced over the first three quarters of the year and increases in the fourth quarter primarily because of holidays and other
seasonal events. Depending on when Easter falls, Easter holiday sales may shift between the first and second quarter. We build inventory based on expected demand and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt so the backlog of
unfilled orders is not material. Funding for working capital items, including inventory and receivables, is normally sourced from operating cash flows and short-term commercial paper borrowings. For additional information on our liquidity, working
capital management, cash flow and financing activities, see

Liquidity and Capital Resources

, Note 1

, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,

and Note 7,

Debt and Borrowing Arrangements

, appearing later in this

filing.

Competition

We face
competition in all aspects of our business. Competitors include large multinational as well as numerous local and regional companies. Some competitors have different profit objectives and investment time horizons than we do and therefore approach
pricing and promotional decisions differently. We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, service, product innovation, taste, convenience, nutritional value, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences,
effectiveness of sales and marketing, routes to market and distribution networks, promotional activity and price. Improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial research, development, advertising and promotional
expenditures. We believe these investments lead to better products for the consumer and support our growth and market position.



Distribution and Marketing

Across our segments, we generally sell our products to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, convenience stores,
gasoline stations, drug stores, value stores and other retail food outlets. We distribute our products through direct store delivery, company-owned and satellite warehouses, distribution centers and other facilities. We use the services of
independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations.

Consumers are also increasingly shopping online. And we are building a global

e-commerce

organization and capabilities to pursue online growth with partners in key markets around the world, including both pure

e-tailers

and

brick-and-mortar

retailers. We continue to invest in both talent and capabilities. Our

e-commerce

channel strategies will play a
critical role in our ambition to be the best snacking company in the world.

We conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities:
(i) consumer marketing and advertising including

on-air,

print, outdoor, digital and social media and other product promotions; (ii) consumer sales incentives such as coupons and rebates; and
(iii) trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers.

Raw Materials and Packaging

We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, dairy, wheat, palm and other vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, flavoring agents and
nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses. We monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so
we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production.

A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market
conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency
impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge
against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs.

While the costs of our principal raw
materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources. For additional information on our commodity costs, refer to the

Commodity Trends

section within

Management’s

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations

.

Intellectual Property

Our intellectual property rights (including
trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, technology and

know-how)

are material to our business.

We own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their
registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to
processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent
protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability
of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.



From time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks, patents and/or proprietary trade
secrets in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third party products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands, patents and/or proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group,
Inc. (“Kraft Foods Group,” which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the

spin-off

of our North American grocery business.

Research and Development

We pursue four objectives in research and development: product safety and quality, growth through new products, superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs. Our
innovation efforts focus on anticipating consumer demands and adapting quickly to changing market trends. Wellness products and healthy snacking are a significant focus of our current research and development initiatives. These initiatives aim to
accelerate our growth and margins by addressing consumer needs and market trends and leveraging our global innovation platforms, Power Brands and breakthrough technologies. In September 2016, we announced our plan to invest $65 million over
2017-2018 to build out and modernize our network of global research and development facilities. We are focusing our technical resources at nine large locations to drive global growth and innovation. We celebrated the official opening of our Wroclaw
Poland Technical Center in 2017. Our global Technical Centers will enable greater effectiveness, improved efficiency and accelerated project delivery. These locations are in Curitiba, Brazil; Suzhou, China; Thane, India; Mexico City, Mexico; East
Hanover, New Jersey; Wroclaw, Poland; Jurong, Singapore; Bournville, United Kingdom and Reading, United Kingdom.

At December 31, 2017, we had approximately
2,450 scientists and engineers, of which 1,900 are primarily focused on research and development and the remainder are primarily focused on quality assurance and regulatory affairs. Our research and development expense was $366 million in 2017,
$376 million in 2016 and $409 million in 2015.

Regulation

Our food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multinational regulations related to labeling, health and nutrition claims, packaging, pricing,
marketing and advertising, privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for select food products, grading food
products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention, and the scrutiny of human rights
issues in industry supply chains has led to developing regulation in many countries. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review.

Examples of laws and regulations that affect our business include selective food taxes, labeling requirements such as

front-of-pack

labeling and nutrient profiling, marketing restrictions, potential withdrawal of trade concessions as dispute settlement retaliation and sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials. We will
continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations. At this time, we do not expect the cost of complying with new laws and regulations will be material. Also refer to Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency
Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting

, for additional information on government regulations and currency-related impacts on our operations in the United Kingdom, Argentina and other countries.

Environmental Regulation

Throughout the countries in which we do business,
we are subject to local, national and multinational environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements. In
the United States, the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Based on information currently
available, we believe that our compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results.



Sustainability

A key strategic
goal for us is to

Grow our Impact.

Building positive impact for people and our planet is at the core of who we are. We call our commitment to drive business growth with positive change in the world

Impact For Growth

. Many of the
challenges facing people and the planet are interrelated. Our core programs and initiatives holistically address both by working to reduce our environmental footprint, empower farmers and support the communities where our snacks are sourced. We
continue to leverage our global operating scale to secure sustainable raw materials and work with suppliers to drive meaningful social and environmental changes, focusing on where we can make the most impact. For example, we launched our Cocoa
Life program in 2012 and will continue to invest up to $400 million through 2022 to build a sustainable cocoa supply. We are also improving sustainability in our wheat supply by working with farmers in North America and through our Harmony
program in Europe.

Our 2020 sustainability goals aim to place us at the forefront in the fight against climate change with ambitious targets for an

end-to-end

approach to reduce our carbon footprint, including reducing our absolute CO


emissions from manufacturing
and addressing deforestation in key raw material supply chains. We are working to cut our absolute water footprint in manufacturing, focusing on priority sites where water is most scarce. We are also working to reduce waste in manufacturing and
packaging.

We have been recognized for our ongoing economic, environmental and social contributions. This year we were again listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index (“DJSI”) – World and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry. We
are at the


nd

percentile of our industry and achieved perfect scores in health and nutrition and environmental reporting.

We also participate in the CDP Climate and Water disclosures and continue to work to reduce our carbon and water footprints. We are committed to continue this and other
related work in the areas of sustainable resources and agriculture, well-being snacks, community partnerships and safety of our products and people.

Employees

We employed through our consolidated subsidiaries approximately 83,000 people worldwide at December 31, 2017 and approximately 90,000 at December 31,
2016. Employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 64% of our 71,000 employees outside the United States and approximately 28% of our 12,000 U.S. employees. Our business units are subject to various local,
national and multinational laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. In accordance with European Union requirements, we also have established a European Workers Council composed of management and elected members of
our workforce. We or our subsidiaries are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and we work to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

You should read the
following risk factors carefully when evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form

10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect
our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters described in this Annual Report on Form

10-K.

While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors
affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may adversely affect our business, performance or financial condition in the future.



We operate in a highly competitive industry.

The food and snacking industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors include major international food, snack and beverage companies that operate in multiple
geographic areas and numerous local and regional companies. If we do not effectively respond to challenges from our competitors, our business could be adversely affected.

Competitor and customer pressures may require that we reduce our prices. These pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and
other cost increases. Failure to effectively and timely assess, change and set proper pricing or effective trade incentives may negatively impact our operating results and achievement of our strategic and financial goals. The rapid emergence of new
distribution channels, such as

e-commerce,

may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or
other cost increases. We may need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing, advertising, new product innovation, and existing and new distribution channels to protect or increase market share. These expenditures might not result in trade and
consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we reduce prices or our costs increase but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset those changes, then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer.

In addition, like other companies in our industry, we are under pressure to continue to improve the efficiency of our overall cost structure. We are pursuing a
transformation agenda with the goals of focusing our portfolio, improving our cost structure and operating model, and accelerating our growth. If we do not achieve these objectives or do not implement transformation in a way that minimizes
disruptions to our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Maintaining and enhancing our
reputation and brand image is essential to our business success.

Our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand quality and image, extend
our brands into new geographies and to new distribution platforms, including

e-commerce,

and expand our brand image with new and renewed product offerings.

We seek to enhance our brand image through product renovation, innovation and marketing investments, including advertising and consumer promotions. Failure to
effectively address the continuing global focus on well-being, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients, nutritional expectations of our products, and increased attention from the media, shareholders, activists and other stakeholders on
the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image. Undue caution or inaction on our part in addressing these challenges and trends could weaken our competitive position. Such pressures could also lead to stricter regulations and
increased focus on food and snacking marketing practices. Increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising, consumer promotions and labeling, or our response to those restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend and expand
our brands. Moreover, adverse publicity or regulatory or legal action against us on product quality and safety, where we manufacture our products, or environmental risks or human and workplace rights across our supply chain could damage our
reputation and brand image. Such actions could undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or these matters are immaterial to our operations. Our product
sponsorship relationships could also subject us to negative publicity.

In addition, our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand image depends on our ability
to anticipate change and adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns. A variety of legal and regulatory restrictions
limit how and to whom we market our products. These restrictions may limit our brand renovation, innovation and promotion plans, particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve. Negative posts or comments about us
or our brands on social media or web sites (whether factual or not) or security breaches related to use of our social media and failure to respond effectively to these posts, comments or activities could seriously damage our reputation and brand
image across the various regions in which we operate. In addition, we might fail to invest sufficiently in maintaining, extending and expanding our brands, our marketing efforts might not achieve desired results and we might be required to recognize
impairment charges on our brands or related intangible assets or goodwill. Furthermore, third parties may sell counterfeit or spurious versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks. If consumers confuse these counterfeit products
for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand, they might refrain from purchasing our brands in the future, which could harm our brand image and sales. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand
image, then our brands, product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.



We are subject to risks from operating globally.

We are a global company and generated 75.8% of our 2017 net revenues, 75.6% of our 2016 net revenues and 78.7% of our 2015 net revenues outside the United States. We
manufacture and market our products in approximately 160 countries and have operations in more than 80 countries. Therefore, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations. Those risks include:

•

compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”);

•

compliance with antitrust and competition laws, trade laws, data privacy laws, anti-bribery laws, and a variety of other local, national and multinational regulations and laws in multiple regimes;

•

currency devaluations or fluctuations in currency values, including in developing markets such as Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Nigeria, Ukraine and South Africa as well as in developed
markets such as the United Kingdom and other countries within the European Union;

•

the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities like cocoa, potential changes in U.S. trade programs and trade relations with other countries,
or regulations, taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales;

•

changes in capital controls, including currency exchange controls, government currency policies such as demonetization in India or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product into various
countries or repatriate cash from outside the United States;

•

increased sovereign risk, such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit ratings of governments, particularly in our Latin America and AMEA regions;

•

changes in local regulations and laws, the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in

non-U.S.

jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for
nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources;

•

varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights;

•

discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies;

•

greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; and

•

design, implementation and use of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base.

In addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, travel or
immigration restrictions, public corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. High unemployment or the slowdown in economic growth in some
markets could constrain consumer spending. Declining consumer purchasing power could result in loss of market share and adversely impact our profitability. Continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries or the
dynamics and uncertainties associated with the United Kingdom’s planned exit from the European Union (“Brexit”), including currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility in global stock markets, could have a negative effect on our
business. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, results of operations, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and
employees in the short or long term.

Tax matters, including changes in tax laws and rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes,
could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.

In December 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation (“U.S. tax
reform”). The legislation implements many new U.S. domestic and international tax provisions. Many aspects of the U.S. tax reform are unclear, and although additional clarifying guidance is expected to be issued in the future (by the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”), the U.S. Treasury Department or via a technical correction law change), it may not be clarified for some time. In addition, many U.S. states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal
legislation. As a result, we have not yet been able to determine the full impact of the new laws on our results of operations and financial condition. It is possible that U.S. tax reform, or interpretations under it, could change and could have
an adverse effect on us, and such effect could be material.



In addition, foreign jurisdictions may also enact tax legislation that could significantly affect our ongoing operations.
For example, foreign tax authorities could impose rate changes along with additional corporate tax provisions that would disallow or tax perceived base erosion or profit shifting. Aspects of U.S. tax reform may lead foreign jurisdictions to respond
by enacting additional tax legislation that is unfavorable to us.

Adverse changes in the underlying profitability or financial outlook of our operations in several
jurisdictions could lead to changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets and result in a charge to our income tax provision. Additionally, changes in tax laws in the U.S. or in other countries where we have significant operations could
materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities and our income tax provision.

We are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities. Although we
believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties. Unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could
significantly adversely affect our income tax provision and our results of operations.

Our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political,
economic and regulatory risks.

Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets, including among others Brazil,
China, India, Mexico, Russia, Argentina, Ukraine, the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. However, some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions
than more established markets. In many countries, particularly those with emerging economies, engaging in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, or local
anti-bribery laws may be more common. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials, including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other
actions necessary to do business. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers improve and expand their
production capacities. Our success in emerging markets is critical to achieving our growth strategy. If we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political, economic and regulatory risks, our product
sales, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, such as occurred when we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our Venezuelan operations at the close of 2015 or any potential impact on our
business in Venezuela from future economic or political developments.

Our use of information technology and third party service providers exposes us to
cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions that could adversely affect us.

We use information technology and third party service providers to
support our global business processes and activities, including supporting critical business operations; communicating with our suppliers, customers and employees; maintaining effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure controls;
engaging in mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions; conducting research and development activities; meeting regulatory, legal and tax requirements; and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities. Global
shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing amount of services to conduct our business, including a number of accounting, internal control, human resources and computing functions.



Continuity of business applications and services has been, and may in the future be, disrupted by events such as infection
by viruses or malware, like the global malware incident in June 2017 that affected a significant portion of our global sales, distribution and financial networks (the “malware incident”) (see

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Malware Incident

); other cybersecurity attacks; issues with or errors in systems’ maintenance or security; migration of applications to the cloud; power outages; hardware or software
failures; denial of service; telecommunication failures; natural disasters; terrorist attacks; and other catastrophic occurrences. Further, cybersecurity breaches of our or third party systems, whether from circumvention of security systems,

denial-of-service

attacks or other cyberattacks, hacking, phishing attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social
engineering, physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to us or our employees, customers, consumers, partners, suppliers, or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached. When risks such as
these materialize, the need for us to coordinate with various third party service providers and for third party service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might make it more challenging to resolve the related issues. Additionally, if new
initiatives, such as those related to

e-commerce

and direct sales, increase the amount of confidential information that we process and maintain, this could increase our potential exposure to a cybersecurity
breach. If our controls, disaster recovery and business continuity plans or those of our third party providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner, our product sales, financial
condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results, loss of intellectual property and damage to our reputation or brands.

We continue to devote focused resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and
data; we are also in the process of enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment. However, security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach
or disruption on a timely basis. In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats, we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident, and the cost and operational expense of implementing, maintaining and enhancing
protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly.

We regularly move data across national
borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the
collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. The
European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and becomes effective in May 2018, adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data
including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and imposes substantial penalties for

non-compliance

of up to the greater of

€

20 million
or 4% of global annual revenue for the preceding financial year. Our efforts to comply with GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, and we could incur
substantial penalties or litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations.

Unanticipated business disruptions could
adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers.

We manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale. We utilize an
integrated supply chain – a complex network of suppliers and material needs, owned manufacturing locations,

co-manufacturing

locations, distribution networks, shared service delivery centers and
information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, like weather (including any potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, supply
and commodity shortages, fire, explosions, terrorism, political unrest, cybersecurity breaches, generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or

co-manufacturers’

operations. If we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations, for example, by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key or sole manufacturing or
distribution locations, or cannot quickly repair damage to our information, production or supply systems, we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers such as occurred in connection with the malware incident (see

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Malware Incident

), and the quality and safety of our products might be negatively affected. If a material or extended disruption occurs, we may
lose our customers’ or business partners’ confidence or suffer damage to our reputation, and long-term consumer demand for our products could decline. In addition, we might not have the functions, processes or organizational capability
necessary to achieve on our anticipated timeframes our strategic ambition to reconfigure our supply chain and drive efficiencies to fuel growth. Further, our ability to supply



multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint may be negatively impacted by portfolio complexity, significant changes in trade policies, changes in volume produced and changes to
regulatory restrictions or labor-related constraints on our ability to adjust production capacity in the markets in which we operate. These events could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of
operations.

We are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations.

At
December 31, 2017, we sold our products in approximately 160 countries and had operations in more than 80 countries. Consequently, a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial results
and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes or converted into U.S. dollars to service
obligations such as our U.S. dollar-denominated indebtedness and to pay dividends to our shareholders. In addition, movements in currency exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries. We
seek to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily on cross-currency transactions, but our efforts may not be successful. Accordingly, changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into U.S. dollars
for financial reporting purposes or for transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Commodity and other input prices are volatile and may increase or decrease significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained.

We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, dairy, wheat, palm and other vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, flavoring agents and
nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses. Prices for these raw materials, other supplies and energy are
volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict. These conditions include global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, political conditions, severe weather, the potential longer-term consequences of climate
change on agricultural productivity, crop disease or pests, water risk, health pandemics, consumer or industrial demand, and changes in governmental trade, alternative energy and agricultural programs. Increasing focus on climate change,
deforestation, water, plastic waste, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system may lead to increased government intervention and consumer or activist responses, and could adversely affect our or
our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. Many of the commodities we purchase are grown by smallholder farmers, and they might lack the capacity to invest to increase
productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases, we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from
increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase
or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result. Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover higher input costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input
costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply of key commodities may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not
effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices, or if we are limited by supply constraints, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Complying with changes in and inconsistencies among laws and regulations in many countries in which we operate could increase our costs.

Our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight. Various laws and regulations govern food production, packaging, storage,
distribution, sales, advertising, labeling and marketing, as well as licensing, trade, labor, tax and environmental matters, and health and safety practices. Government authorities regularly change laws and regulations as well as their
interpretations. Our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
For instance, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected by the regulatory and economic impact of changes in taxation and trade relations among the United States and other countries, including any changes to or
repeal of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or changes in the European Union such as Brexit.



We may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or manage
changes in our workforce.

We must hire, retain and develop effective leaders and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce. We compete to hire new
personnel with a variety of capabilities in the many countries in which we manufacture and market our products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies. Unplanned turnover, failure to attract and develop personnel with key
emerging capabilities such as

e-commerce

and digital marketing skills, or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or to hire and retain a diverse global workforce with the skills
and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate
skilled employees.

We also face increased personnel-related risks in connection with implementing the changes in our transformation agenda related to our operating
model and business processes, including building a global shared services capability and reconfiguring our supply chain. These risks could lead to operational challenges, including increased competition for employees with the skills we require to
achieve our business goals; higher employee turnover, including of employees with key capabilities; and challenges in developing the capabilities necessary to build and effectively execute a shared services function and transform our business
processes. Furthermore, we might be unable to manage appropriately changes in, or that affect, our workforce or satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees. This includes our management of employees
represented by labor unions or workers’ councils, who represent approximately 64% of our 71,000 employees outside the United States and approximately 28% of our 12,000 U.S. employees. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest by
our employees or those of our suppliers or distributors, or situations like the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements that expired in February 2016 and that cover eight U.S. facilities, could cause disruptions to our supply chain,
manufacturing or distribution processes.

These risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation, ability to meet the needs of our customers, product
sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Our retail customers are consolidating and we must leverage our value proposition in order to compete
against retailer and other economy brands.

Retail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors in the European Union, the United
States and other major markets, continue to consolidate, form buying alliances or be acquired by new entrants in the food retail market, resulting in fewer, larger customers. Large retail customers and customer alliances can delist our products or
reduce the shelf space allotted to our products and demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs or longer payment terms. Retail customers might also adopt these tactics in their dealings with us in response to the significant growth in
online retailing for consumer products, which is outpacing the growth of traditional retail channels. In addition, larger retail customers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and
market their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products. Our products must provide higher quality or value to our consumers than the less expensive alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty.
Consumers may not buy our products if consumers perceive little difference between the quality or value of our products and those of retailer or other economy brands. If consumers switch to purchasing or otherwise prefer the retailer or other
economy brands, then we could lose market share or sales volumes, or we may need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings.

Retail consolidation also
increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they
may delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases.

If we do not effectively respond to retail
consolidation, increasing retail power and competition from retailer and other economy brands, our reputation, brands, product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.



We are subject to changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers.

During 2017, our five largest customers accounted for 15.6% of our net revenues. There can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in
the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands. The loss of or disruptions related to significant customers could result
in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer. This could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes related to pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our
customers or operate our business and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We may decide or
be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims.

We could decide, or laws or regulations could require us, to recall products due to
suspected or confirmed deliberate or unintentional product contamination including contamination of ingredients we use in our products that third parties supply, spoilage or other adulteration, product mislabeling or product tampering. In addition,
if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category. Any of these events could materially and adversely
affect our reputation, brands, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We may also suffer losses if our products or operations or those of
our suppliers violate applicable laws or regulations, or if our or our suppliers’ products cause injury, illness or death. In addition, our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant product
liability or other legal judgment against us, a related regulatory enforcement action, a widespread product recall or attempts to manipulate us based on threats related to the safety of our products could materially and adversely affect our
reputation and profitability. Moreover, even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful, has no merit or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and
adversely affect our reputation, brands, product sales, product inventory, financial condition and results of operations.

We could be subject to legal or tax
claims or other regulatory enforcement actions.

We are a large snack food company operating in highly regulated environments and constantly evolving legal, tax
and regulatory frameworks around the world. Consequently, we are subject to greater risk of litigation, legal or tax claims, or other regulatory enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not
violate policies and procedures we have implemented to promote compliance with existing laws and regulations. Moreover, a failure to maintain effective control environment processes, including in connection with the development of our global shared
services capability, could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. Litigation, legal or tax claims, or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws,
regulations or controls, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We must correctly predict, identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new and improved products that meet those changes.

Consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify and interpret the tastes, dietary
habits, packaging, sales channel and other preferences of consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to these preferences. Moreover, weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other factors, such as severe
weather events, could affect consumer preferences and demand. If we do not offer products that appeal to consumers or if we misjudge consumer demand for our products, our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer.



We must distinguish between short-term fads and trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we do not
accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences or category trends will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those changing preferences, our sales could decline. In addition, because of our varied and
geographically diverse consumer base, we must offer an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories, or if we do not rapidly develop
products in faster growing and more profitable categories, demand for our products could decrease and our profitability could suffer.

Prolonged negative
perceptions concerning the health, environmental and social implications of certain food products and ingredients could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. For example, consumers have
increasingly focused on well-being, including reducing sodium

and added sugar consumption. Developing more well-being products and contemporizing our brands by refining their ingredient and nutrition profiles are critical to our growth. In
addition, consumer preferences differ by region, and we must monitor and adjust our use of ingredients to respond to these regional preferences. We might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and
social expectations. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.

We regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic
alliances that could further our strategic business objectives. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable
transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize
the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes with employees joining us as a result of a transaction; minimize adverse effects on existing business
relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition,
execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial, managerial and operational risks.

With respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards, controls, policies and
procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate, as appropriate, redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of
operations; and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions. Joint ventures and similar strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we share
ownership and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies or resources as we do, or whose interpretation
of applicable policies may differ from our own. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and

non-financial

control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated
benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures, including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic, regulatory and compliance risks, currency
exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input prices. Either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.

Furthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our
growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that
remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.

Any of
these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.



We could fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting.

The accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations. These limitations include, among others, the possibility
of human error, inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud. If we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation
and fair presentation of our financial statements, including in connection with controls executed for us by third parties, we might fail to timely detect any misappropriation of corporate assets or inappropriate allocation or use of funds and could
be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis. As a result, our reputation, results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected.

Weak financial performance, downgrades in our credit ratings, illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the
global capital markets, reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs.

We access the long-term and short-term global capital markets to obtain
financing. Our financial performance, our short-and long-term debt credit ratings, interest rates, the stability of financial institutions with which we partner, the liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global
economy, including the food industry, could affect our access to, and the availability or cost of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions and our ability to pay dividends in the future. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the
global capital markets on terms we find acceptable.

We regularly access the commercial paper markets in the United States and Europe for ongoing funding
requirements. A downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper. Disruptions in the global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile
economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short- and long-term debt offerings.

Limitations on our ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Volatility in the equity markets, interest rates, our participation in multiemployer pension plans and
other factors could increase our costs relating to our employees’ pensions.

We sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for our employees
throughout the world and also contribute toward our employees’ pensions under defined benefit plans that we do not sponsor. At the end of 2017, the projected benefit obligation of the defined benefit pension plans we sponsor was
$12.6 billion and plan assets were $11.0 billion.

For defined benefit pension plans that we maintain, the difference between plan obligations and assets,
or the funded status of the plans, significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Our largest funded defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested
in a globally diversified portfolio of investments, including equities and corporate and government debt. Among other factors, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, investment returns, funding requirements in the
jurisdictions in which the plans operate and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding, cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and increase our future funding requirements. Legislative and other governmental
regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation. Volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we will be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension
plans and recognize further increases in our net periodic pension cost.

We also participate in multiemployer pension plans. Our exposure under those plans may
extend beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our own employees. Our contributions to a multiemployer plan may increase beyond our bargaining obligations depending on the financial condition of the multiemployer plan and the financial
viability of other employers in the plan. We may be required to participate in funding the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable to a withdrawing employer, and our costs might increase as a result. Further, if we partially or completely
withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan, we may be required to pay a partial or complete withdrawal liability. This withdrawal liability will generally increase if there is also a mass withdrawal of other participating employers or if the plan
terminates. (See Note 9,

Benefit Plans

, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our multiemployer pension plans.)



A significant increase in our pension benefit obligations or funding requirements could curtail our ability to invest in
the business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our failure to protect our valuable intellectual property rights could
reduce the value of our products and brands.

We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our patents,
trade secrets, copyrights and licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable part of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret
laws in various countries, as well as licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property
rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.

We may be unaware of third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology, brands or products. Any litigation regarding patents or other
intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations. Third party claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay
monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation, ability to
introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Description of the Company

We manufacture and market primarily snack food
products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy and various cheese & grocery products, as well as powdered beverage products. We have operations in more than 80 countries and sell our
products in approximately 160 countries.

We aim to deliver strong, profitable long-term growth by accelerating our core snacks business and expanding the reach of
our Power Brands globally. To fuel investments in our Power Brands and global and digital reach, we have been working to optimize our cost structure. These efforts include reinventing our supply chain operations and aggressively managing overhead
costs. Through these actions, we’re leveraging our brands, platforms and capabilities to drive long-term value and return on investment for our shareholders.

U.S. Tax Reform

On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax
reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions, including but not limited to a reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% as well as provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions or credits. The
legislation also causes U.S. allocated expenses (e.g. interest and general administrative expenses) to be taxed and imposes a new tax on U.S. cross-border payments. Furthermore, the legislation includes a

one-time

transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits.

In response to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, the
SEC issued guidance to address the complexity in accounting for this new legislation. When the initial accounting for items under the new legislation is incomplete, the guidance allows us to recognize provisional amounts when reasonable estimates
can be made or to continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate of the impact cannot be made. The SEC has provided up to a

one-year

window for companies to finalize the accounting for the
impacts of this new legislation and we anticipate finalizing our accounting during 2018.

While our accounting for the new U.S. tax legislation is not complete, we
have made reasonable estimates for some provisions and recognized a $59 million discrete net tax benefit in our 2017 financial statements. This net benefit is primarily comprised of a $1,311 million provisional deferred tax benefit from
revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate as well as an additional $61 million provisional deferred tax benefit related to changes in our indefinite reinvestment assertion, partially offset by a
$1,317 million provisional charge for the estimated transition tax. However, as of the date of this Form

10-K,

we are continuing to evaluate the accounting impacts of the legislation, as we continue to
assemble and analyze all the information required to prepare and analyze these effects and await additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies. Additionally, we continue to analyze other information
and regulatory guidance, and accordingly we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts in future periods. See Note 14,

Income Taxes

, for further details on the impacts of U.S. tax reform.

Malware Incident

On June 27, 2017, a global malware incident impacted
our business. The malware affected a significant portion of our global sales, distribution and financial networks. In the last four days of the second quarter and during the third quarter, we executed business continuity and contingency plans to
contain the impact, minimize damages and restore our systems environment. To date, we have not found, nor do we expect to find, any instances of Company or personal data released externally. We have now restored our main operating systems and
processes as well as enhanced our system security.



During 2017, we estimate that the loss of revenue as a result of the malware incident had a negative impact of 0.4% on our
net revenue and Organic Net Revenue growth. We also incurred incremental expenses of $84 million predominantly during the second half of 2017 as part of the recovery effort. We believe the recovery from this incident is largely resolved, and we
do not expect significant ongoing impacts or incremental expenses from this incident in future periods. We also continue to make progress on our efforts to strengthen our security measures and mitigate cybersecurity risk. Refer to our

Risk
Factors

section for a discussion of potential risks to our operations from cybersecurity threats.

Coffee Business Transactions

JDE Coffee Business Transactions:

On July 2, 2015, we completed
transactions to combine our wholly owned coffee businesses with those of D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V. to create a new company, Jacob Douwe Egberts (“JDE”). In connection with these transactions, in 2015, we recorded a final

pre-tax

gain of $6.8 billion ($6.6 billion

after-tax)

from the deconsolidation of our legacy coffee businesses. We also recorded approximately $1.0 billion of
cumulative

pre-tax

net gains ($436 million in 2015 and $628 million in 2014) and cash related to currency hedging. See Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions

—

JDE Coffee Business
Transactions

, for additional details. As further described below, in March 2016, we exchanged a portion of our investment in JDE for an investment in Keurig Green Mountain Inc. (“Keurig”). As of December 31, 2017, we hold a 26.5%
voting interest, a 26.4% ownership interest and a 26.2% profit and dividend sharing interest in JDE. We recorded JDE equity earnings of $129 million in 2017 and $100 million in 2016 and equity losses of $58 million in 2015. We also
recorded $49 million of cash dividends received during the first quarter of 2017.

Keurig Transaction:

Following the March 3, 2016 Acorn Holdings B.V. acquisition of Keurig, on March 7, 2016, we exchanged a portion of our equity interest in JDE for an interest
in Keurig valued at $2.0 billion. We recorded the difference between the fair value of the Keurig interest and our basis in JDE shares as a $43 million gain. Following the exchange, our ownership interest in JDE became 26.5% and we owned a
24.2% interest in Keurig. Our initial $2.0 billion investment in Keurig includes a $1.6 billion Keurig equity interest and a $0.4 billion shareholder loan receivable, which are reported on a combined basis within equity method
investments on our consolidated balance sheet. The shareholder loan has a 5.5% interest rate and is payable at the end of a seven-year term on February 27, 2023. We recorded Keurig equity earnings of $208 million in 2017 (of which,
approximately $119 million relates to the provisional tax benefit Keurig recorded as a result of U.S. tax reform), and $77 million in 2016. We recorded shareholder loan interest of $24 million in 2017 and $20 million in 2016.
Additionally, we received shareholder loan interest payments of $30 million in 2017 and $14 million in 2016 and dividends of $14 million in 2017 and $4 million in 2016. See Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions,

for
additional details on the Keurig transaction.

Planned Keurig Dr Pepper Transaction:

On January 29, 2018, we announced that we would exchange our ownership interest in Keurig for equity in Keurig Dr Pepper, which is contingent upon the successful
completion of a planned merger of Keurig with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. Following the close of the merger in

mid-2018,

we expect our ownership in Keurig Dr Pepper to be

13-14%.

We expect to account for this new investment under the equity method as we have for Keurig, resulting in our recognizing our share of their earnings within our earnings and our share of their dividends
within our cash flows. We will have the right to nominate two directors to the board of Keurig Dr Pepper and will have certain governance rights over Keurig Dr Pepper following the transaction.

Venezuela Deconsolidation

Effective as of the close of the 2015 fiscal
year, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries due to a loss of control over our Venezuelan operations and an other-than-temporary lack of currency exchangeability. We recorded a $778 million pretax loss on December 31, 2015 as we
reduced the value of our investment in Venezuela and all Venezuelan receivables held by our other subsidiaries to realizable fair value, resulting in full impairment.

As of the start of 2016, we no longer included net revenues, earnings or net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries within our GAAP consolidated financial statements and
we excluded Venezuela from our

non-GAAP

results for all historical periods presented to facilitate comparisons of operating results. See Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

–

Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting: Venezuela

, for more information on our Venezuela operations, including currency remeasurement losses and the loss on deconsolidation.



Summary of Results

•

Net revenues were approximately $25.9 billion in both 2017 and 2016, a decrease of 0.1% in 2017 and a decrease of 12.5% in 2016. Business deconsolidations and divestitures reduced net revenues during 2015-2017,
with net revenues in 2016 most significantly affected by the deconsolidations of our historical coffee business and Venezuelan operations in 2015 as well as significant unfavorable currency translation impacts in 2016 and 2015.

•

Organic Net Revenue increased 0.9% to $25.5 billion in 2017 and increased 1.5% to $26.4 billion in 2016. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from deconsolidated coffee and
Venezuelan operations, divestitures and an acquisition. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our reconciliation with net
revenues within

Non-GAAP

Financial Measures

appearing later in this section).

•

Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International increased 81.9% to $1.91 in 2017 and decreased 76.4% to $1.05 in 2016. Diluted EPS increased in 2017 as prior-year refinancing and higher restructuring activities
drove lower interest and overhead costs in 2017. We also recorded benefits from resolving two local indirect tax matters and gains from divesting

non-core

businesses during 2017. Diluted EPS was significantly
lower in 2016 primarily as a result of the $6.8 billion gain recorded in 2015 in connection with the JDE coffee business transactions as well as a number of other significant items that affected the comparability of our reported results. See
our

Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results

appearing later in this section for further details.

•

Adjusted EPS increased 15.1% to $2.14 in 2017 and increased 21.6% to $1.86 in 2016. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 14.5% to $2.13 in 2017 and increased 25.5% to $1.92 in 2016. Lower manufacturing
costs and overhead costs, driven by strong productivity efforts, were significant drivers of Adjusted EPS growth in both years. Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis are

non-GAAP

financial
measures. We use these measures as they provide improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within

Non-GAAP

Financial Measures

appearing later in this section).

Financial Outlook

We seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating
Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these

non-GAAP

financial metrics and related computations such as margins internally to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near-and long-term operating and
strategic decisions. As such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) financial results. We believe providing
investors with the same financial information that we use internally ensures that investors have the same data to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and gain additional insight
and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We believe our

non-GAAP

financial measures should always be considered in relation to our GAAP results and we have provided reconciliations between our GAAP
and

non-GAAP

financial measures within

Non-GAAP

Financial Measures

appearing later in this section.

In addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives.

Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends

– Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of populations and rising discretionary
income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets. Over the long term, we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in consumer behaviors such as more frequent, smaller meals, snacking and greater use of
convenience foods. We also recognize changing consumer trends such as the increased emphasis on well-being, time compression and wide participation across an evolving retail and digital landscape. To position ourselves for long-term growth, we are
investing in our well-being and other snack offerings, product and marketing innovation and new routes to market including

e-commerce.



Demand

– We monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we
sell our products. In recent years, low GDP growth, economic recessionary pressures, weak consumer confidence, a historically strong U.S. dollar and changing consumer trends have slowed category and our net revenue growth. While we have begun to see
some improvements in global economic growth and a weaker U.S. dollar in 2017, there are still geopolitical and economic uncertainties, and category growth continues to be soft. Growth in our global snacking categories (excluding Venezuela) decreased
from approximately 3.4% in 2015 and 2.4% in 2016 to 2.1% in 2017. We continue to make investments in our brand and snacks portfolio, while building strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets. In doing
so, we anticipate driving demand in our categories and growing our position in these markets.

Volatility of Global Markets

– Our growth strategy
depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, particularly in emerging markets. Some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more
established markets. Volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business. Refer to Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Venezuela

, for
further discussion of these issues and their impacts on our Venezuela operations. We expect continued volatility across our markets, particularly emerging markets. As such, we are focused on investing in our global Power Brands and routes to market
while we protect our margins through the management of costs and pricing.

Competition

– We operate in highly competitive markets that include global,
regional and local competitors. Our advantaged geographic footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell. To grow
and maintain our market positions, we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through new product innovations and product quality. We also continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing
research and development, advertising, marketing and consumer promotions.

Pricing

– We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables
including demand, the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs. Our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions. Over 2015-2017, we generally increased prices in response
to higher commodity costs, currency and other market factors. In 2018, we anticipate changing market conditions to continue to impact pricing. Price competition may continue to affect net revenues or market share in the near term as the market
adjusts to changes in input costs and other market conditions.

Operating Costs

– Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and
administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. We continue to renegotiate
collective bargaining agreements covering eight U.S. facilities that expired beginning in February 2016. We have plans to ensure business continuity during the renegotiations. To remain competitive on our operating structure, we continue to work on
programs to expand our profitability and margins, such as our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. Effective on
October 1, 2016, we also integrated our EEMEA region operations into our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments. This change had a favorable impact on our operating performance due to greater leverage of our European and AMEA regional
businesses and resulting cost structure.

Taxes

– While the 2017 U.S. tax reform reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate and included beneficial depreciation
provisions, other provisions could have an adverse effect on our results. Specifically, new provisions that cause U.S. allocated expenses (e.g. interest and general administrative expenses) to be taxed and impose a tax on U.S. cross-border payments
could adversely impact our effective tax rate. We will continue to evaluate the impacts as additional guidance on implementing the legislation becomes available.



Currency

– As a global company with 75.8% of our net revenues generated outside the United States, we are
continually exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements. In 2017, the U.S. dollar began to weaken relative to other currencies in which we operate, while in 2015 and 2016, the U.S. dollar generally was stronger as a
number of countries experienced significant declines in or devaluations of their currency. The currency movements created volatility in our reported results of operations. Unfavorable currency translation impacts were 12.6 percentage points (or 12.0
percentage points excluding currency impacts related to Venezuela) of the 13.5% net revenue decrease in 2015 and 4.6 percentage points of the 12.5% net revenue decrease in 2016. In 2017, the 0.1% net revenue decrease reflected 0.3 percentage points
of favorable currency translation impacts as the U.S. dollar generally weakened against a number of currencies this past year. As currency movements can make comparisons of year-over-year operating performance challenging, we isolate the impact of
currency and also report growth on a constant currency basis, holding prior-year currency exchange rates constant, so that prior-year and current-year results can be compared on a consistent basis.

Historically, we have also been exposed to currency devaluation risks impacting earnings particularly, but not only, in connection with our Venezuela operations that
were deconsolidated at the close of the 2015 fiscal year. In the months following the Brexit vote in June 2016, there was significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates. The value of the British pound sterling
relative to the U.S. dollar declined significantly and negatively affected our translated results reported in U.S. dollars. In December 2017, the European Union and United Kingdom agreed to begin trade negotiations, and we could experience
additional volatility in the British pound sterling as the Brexit negotiations move forward.

To partially offset the translation of certain of our overseas
operations, including the United Kingdom, we enter into net investment hedges primarily in the form of local currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps and other financial instruments. We generally do not hedge against currency translation
and primarily seek to hedge against economic losses on cross-currency transactions. Due to limited markets for hedging currency transactions and other factors, we may not be able to effectively hedge all of our cross-currency transaction risks.
Local economies, monetary policies and currency hedging availability can affect our ability to hedge against currency-related economic losses. While we work to mitigate our exposure to currency risks, factors such as continued global and local
market volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty, limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to unfavorable currency impacts in the future. We monitor currency-related risks and economies at risk of qualifying
for highly inflationary accounting under U.S. GAAP, such as Argentina and Ukraine. While we work to safeguard our business, currency devaluations could adversely affect future demand for our products, our financial results and operations, and our
relationships with customers, suppliers and employees in the short or long-term. We may not be able to fully offset the increased risks related to currency devaluations and Brexit, which could impact profitability should the currency-related
conditions continue. See Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting

, and Note 8,

Financial Instruments

, for additional information.

Financing Costs

– We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. We continue to use

low-cost,

short- and
long-term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, dividends and share repurchases. We also expect to use existing cash or short-term borrowings to finance the estimated $1.3 billion U.S. tax
reform transition tax liability payable through 2026. During 2017, we retired $1.5 billion of long-term debt and issued lower-cost, short-term commercial paper and long-term Swiss franc debt. During 2016, we retired $6.2 billion of our
long-term debt and issued lower-cost, long-term euro, Swiss franc and U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2017 was 2.1%, down from 2.2% as of December 31, 2016 and down from
3.7% as of December 31, 2015. We also continue to use interest rate swaps and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate and cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and
protect the value of our debt. For example, through February 8, 2018, we entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps and forwards with an aggregate notional value of $3.2 billion to hedge our

non-U.S.

net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. We designated these swaps and forwards as net investment hedges related to our operations in our Europe and AMEA regions. We expect a
favorable impact on our prospective financing costs as we reduce some of the financing costs and related currency impacts within our interest costs. Refer to Note 7,

Debt and Borrowing Arrangements

, and Note 8,

Financial Instruments

,
for additional information on our debt and derivative activity.

Net revenue decline of 0.1% was driven by the impact of divestitures, partially offset by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 0.9%, favorable currency and the
impact of an acquisition. The impact of divestitures resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $383 million for 2017. Our underlying Organic Net Revenue increase was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable
volume/mix. Net pricing was up, which includes the benefit of carryover pricing from 2016 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2017. Higher net pricing was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, partially offset by
lower net pricing in North America and Europe. Unfavorable volume/mix was reflected in all segments except Europe, in part due to expected shipments that we did not realize following the second quarter malware incident. Favorable year-over-year
currency impacts increased net revenues by $77 million, due primarily to the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Brazilian real, euro, Russian ruble, Australian dollar, Indian rupee and South African rand,
partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Egyptian pound, British pound sterling, Argentinean peso, Nigerian naira, Turkish lira, Philippine peso and Chinese yuan. The November 2, 2016
acquisition of a business and license to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits in additional key markets added $59 million (constant currency basis) of incremental net revenues for 2017.

for more information. Primarily includes the reversal of tax liabilities in connection with the resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax matter

During 2017, we realized higher net pricing while
input costs increased modestly. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2016 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2017, was driven by Latin America and AMEA, partially
offset by lower net pricing in North America and Europe. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs which were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by North
America, Latin America and AMEA, which was partially offset by favorable volume/mix in Europe.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased
$629 million from 2016, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the benefits from the resolution of tax matters, lower implementation costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, lower
divestiture-related costs, a property insurance recovery in AMEA and lower intangible asset impairment charges. The decreases were partially offset by gains on sales of property in 2016, unfavorable currency impact, Value-added tax (“VAT”)
related settlements in 2016 and incremental expenses incurred due to the malware incident.

Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased $405 million from 2016. The decrease was driven primarily by lower overhead costs and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due to continued cost reduction efforts in both areas.

Currency changes during the year did not impact operating income as the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Egyptian pound,
British pound sterling and Argentinean peso, was offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Australian dollar, Indian rupee and South African rand.

Operating income margin increased from 9.9% in 2016 to 13.5% in 2017. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by an increase in our Adjusted
Operating Income margin, lower 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs, the benefits from the resolution of tax matters, the net gain on divestitures and lower divestiture-related costs, partially offset by incremental costs related to the malware
incident and CEO transition remuneration costs. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 15.0% in 2016 to 16.3% in 2017. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by lower overheads and lower advertising and
consumer promotion costs due to continued cost reduction efforts in both areas.

Net revenue decline of 12.5% was driven by the impact of the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, unfavorable
currency, the deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan operations and the year-over-year impact of the 2015 accounting calendar change, partially offset by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 1.5%, and the impact of acquisitions. The
adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,627 million for 2016. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,233 million, due primarily to the
strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, British pound sterling, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Chinese yuan and Russian ruble. The deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan operations resulted in
a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,217 million for 2016. The North America segment accounting calendar change in 2015 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $76 million for 2016. Our underlying Organic Net
Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Net pricing was up, which includes the benefit of carryover pricing from 2015 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2016.
Higher net pricing was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe and North America. Unfavorable volume/mix was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, mostly offset by favorable volume/mix in Europe and North
America. Unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and AMEA was largely due to price elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain

low-margin

product lines. The impact of acquisitions primarily
includes the July 15, 2015 acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam, which added $71 million of incremental net revenues for 2016, and the November 2, 2016 acquisition of a business and a license to manufacture, market and sell
Cadbury-branded biscuits in additional key markets, which added $16 million of incremental net revenues for 2016.

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with
the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in

after-tax

equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. In periods prior to July 2,
2015, we have reclassified the equity method earnings from Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis.

During 2016, we realized higher net pricing while input costs increased modestly. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in
2015, was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe and North America. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on
imported materials, which were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity. Favorable volume/mix was driven by Europe and North America, which was mostly offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and AMEA.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $1,037 million from 2015, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the
deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, a favorable currency impact, lower costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, gains on the sales of property,

VAT-related

settlements and the absence of devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela in 2016. The decreases were partially offset by increases from divestiture-related costs associated with
the planned sale of a confectionery business in France, the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, higher implementation costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and the impact of acquisitions.

Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $318 million from 2015. The decrease was driven primarily by lower
overhead costs due to continued cost reduction efforts.

We recorded a benefit of $54 million in 2016 from

VAT-related

settlements in Latin America as compared to $30 million in 2015. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $171 million due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the
British pound sterling, Argentinean peso and Mexican peso.

Operating income margin decreased from 30.0% in 2015 to 9.9% in 2016. The decrease in operating income
margin was driven primarily by last year’s

pre-tax

gain on the JDE coffee business transactions, the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations,
the unfavorable year-over-year change in

mark-to-market

gains/losses from derivatives, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, divestiture-related
costs associated with the planned sale of a confectionery business in France, higher intangible asset impairment charges and the reclassification of equity method earnings. The items that decreased our operating income margin were partially offset
by the prior-year loss on the Venezuela deconsolidation, an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin and the absence of costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 12.7% in 2015
to 15.0% in 2016. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by lower overheads from cost reduction programs, improved gross margin reflecting productivity efforts, gains on sales of property and

VAT-related

settlements.

On October 1, 2016, we integrated our EEMEA operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific
operating segments to further leverage and optimize the operating scale built within the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined within our Europe operating segment, while the remaining
Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific region to form a new AMEA regional operating segment. We have reflected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented.

We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth
opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments were part of our base business. Beginning in the
third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for our new coffee equity method investment in JDE, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in equity method investment earnings outside of segment operating income. For
the six months ended December 31, 2015,

after-tax

equity method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis. Earnings from equity method investments through July 2,
2015 recorded within segment operating income were $52 million in AMEA and $4 million in North America. See Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Principles of Consolidation,

and Note 2,

Divestitures and
Acquisitions,

for additional information.



In 2015, we also began to report stock-based compensation for our corporate employees within general corporate expenses
that were reported within our North America region. We reclassified $32 million of corporate stock-based compensation expense in 2015 from the North America segment to general corporate expenses.

We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze
segment performance and trends. See Note 16,

2017 compared with 2016:

Net
revenues increased $174 million (5.1%), due to higher net pricing (7.7 pp) and favorable currency (1.9 pp), partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix (4.2 pp) and the impact of a divestiture (0.3 pp). Higher net pricing was reflected across
all categories driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Favorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of several currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Brazilian real, partially offset by the
strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Argentinean peso and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume/mix, which occurred across most of the region, was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity. In addition, only a portion of the
shipments delayed at the end of the second quarter due to the malware incident was recovered. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in all categories except chocolate and candy. On December 1, 2016, we sold a small confectionery
business in Costa Rica.

Segment operating income increased $294 million (108.5%), primarily due to higher net pricing, the benefit from the resolution of a
Brazilian indirect tax matter of $153 million, lower manufacturing costs, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, favorable currency and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially
offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable volume/mix and higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of prior-year

VAT-related

settlements).

2016 compared with 2015:

Net revenues decreased $1,596 million
(32.0%), due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations (21.9 pp), unfavorable currency (14.8 pp), unfavorable volume/mix (5.3 pp) and the impact of a divestiture (0.1 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (10.1 pp). The
deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,217 million. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region,
including the Argentinean peso and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume/mix, which primarily occurred in Brazil and Argentina, was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain

low-margin

product lines. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in all categories except for cheese & grocery. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories driven primarily by Argentina,
Brazil and Mexico.

Segment operating income decreased $214 million (44.1%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan
operations, unfavorable volume/mix and unfavorable currency. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including higher year-over year

VAT-related

settlements), lower manufacturing costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and the absence of remeasurement losses in 2016
related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela.

2017 compared with 2016:

Net
revenues decreased $77 million (1.3%), due to the impact of divestitures (2.2 pp), unfavorable currency (1.8 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.2 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.9 pp). The impact of divestitures, primarily related
to the grocery & cheese business in Australia and New Zealand that was divested on July 4, 2017, resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $128 million for 2017. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the
strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the region, including the Egyptian pound, Nigerian naira, Philippine peso, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen, partially offset by the strength of several other currencies in the region
relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Australian dollar, Indian rupee and South African rand. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in refreshment beverages, cheese & grocery, gum and candy, partially offset by gains in
chocolate and biscuits. In addition, only a portion of the shipments delayed at the end of the second quarter due to the malware incident was recovered. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese & grocery.

Segment operating income increased $10 million (2.0%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including a
property insurance recovery), lower manufacturing costs and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were mostly offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, unfavorable volume/mix, higher costs incurred
for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the impact of divestitures and higher intangible asset impairment charges.

2016 compared with 2015:

Net revenues decreased $186 million (3.1%), due to unfavorable currency (3.9 pp), the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (1.1 pp)
and unfavorable volume/mix (1.0 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (1.7 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (1.2 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the
region, including the Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, South African rand, Egyptian pound, Nigerian naira, Philippine peso and Australian dollar, partially offset by the strength of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar. The adjustment for
deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $66 million. Unfavorable volume/mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain

low-margin

product lines, was driven by declines in candy, refreshment beverages, cheese & grocery and chocolate, partially offset by gains in biscuits and gum. Higher net pricing was driven by
chocolate, candy, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by lower net pricing in gum and cheese & grocery. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam in July 2015 added net revenues of $71 million (constant
currency basis).

Segment operating income increased $117 million (30.1%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, higher net pricing, lower other selling,
general and administrative expenses, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the absence of costs associated with the coffee business transactions and the impact of the Vietnam acquisition. These favorable items were partially
offset by higher raw material costs, the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency, the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business and the impact of divestitures.

Favorable volume/mix was driven by chocolate and biscuits, partially offset by declines in gum, cheese & grocery, candy and refreshment beverages. In addition, a portion of the shipments delayed at the end of the second quarter due to the
malware incident was not recovered. Favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of several other currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro and Russian ruble, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar against several
currencies in the region, including the British pound sterling and Turkish lira. The November 2016 acquisition of a business and license to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits added net revenues of $59 million (constant
currency basis). The impact of divestitures, primarily due to the sale of a confectionery business in France, resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $234 million for 2017. Lower net pricing was driven by biscuits, mostly offset
by higher net pricing in all other categories.

Segment operating income increased $413 million (32.6%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, lower
costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower divestiture-related costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, the benefit from the settlement of a Cadbury tax
matter, favorable volume/mix, lower intangible asset impairment charges, favorable currency and the impact of an acquisition. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, the impact of divestitures, incremental costs
incurred due to the malware incident, lower net pricing and a prior-year gain on the sale of an intangible asset.

2016 compared with 2015:

Net revenues decreased $1,917 million (16.4%), due to the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (12.9 pp), unfavorable currency (4.4 pp),
lower net pricing (0.4 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.2 pp), partially offset by favorable volume/mix (1.3 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.2 pp). The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a
year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,561 million. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar against most currencies in the region, primarily the British pound sterling. Lower net pricing was reflected
across most categories except candy and gum. Favorable volume/mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain

low-margin

Segment operating income decreased $83 million (6.1%), primarily due to the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, unfavorable
currency, higher raw material costs, divestiture-related costs, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, lower net pricing, higher intangible asset impairment charges and the impact of divestitures. These unfavorable items were
partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions, lower manufacturing costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, favorable volume/mix and a gain on the sale of an intangible asset.

shipments delayed at the end of the second quarter due to the malware incident that were not recovered, was driven by declines in gum, biscuits and candy, partially offset by a gain in chocolate. Lower net pricing was reflected in biscuits and
chocolate, partially offset by higher net pricing in candy and gum. Favorable currency impact was due to the strength of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.

Segment operating income increased $42 million (3.9%), primarily due to lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, lower other selling, general
and administrative expenses (net of the prior-year’s gain on sale of property), lower manufacturing costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs and lower raw material costs. These favorable items were partially offset by unfavorable
volume/mix, incremental costs incurred due to the malware incident, lower net pricing, the impact of divestitures and prior-year gain on the sale of an intangible asset.

2016 compared with 2015:

Net revenues decreased $14 million
(0.2%), due to the impact of an accounting calendar change made in the prior year (1.1 pp), unfavorable currency (0.3 pp) and lower net pricing (0.2 pp), mostly offset by favorable volume/mix (1.4 pp). The prior-year change in North
America’s accounting calendar resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $76 million. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Lower net pricing was reflected in
biscuits and candy, partially offset by higher net pricing in chocolate and gum. Favorable volume/ mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain

and lower net pricing. These unfavorable items were mostly offset by lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including the gain on sale of property), lower manufacturing costs, favorable volume/mix and the gain on the sale of an
intangible asset.



Critical Accounting Estimates

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and
assumptions. Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have
discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.

Goodwill and

Non-Amortizable

Intangible Assets

:

We have historically annually tested goodwill and

non-amortizable

intangible assets for impairment as of October 1. This year, we
voluntarily changed the annual impairment assessment date from October 1 to July 1. We believe this measurement date, which represents a change in the method of applying an accounting principle, is preferable because it better aligns with our
strategic business planning process and financial forecasts which are key components of the annual impairment tests. The change in the measurement date did not delay, accelerate or prevent an impairment charge. Each quarter, we have evaluated
goodwill and intangible asset impairment risks and recognized any related impairments to date. As such, the change in the annual test date was applied on July 1, 2017.

We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting
our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such
as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value
with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North
America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 7.2% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 10.2%.
Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value
of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit fair value.

In 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2017 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair
value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if we do not meet business performance expectations or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change
significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.

Annually, we
assess

non-amortizable

intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinite-lived
intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using planned growth
rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.



During our 2017 annual testing of

non-amortizable

intangible assets, we recorded
$70 million of impairment charges in the third quarter of 2017 related to five trademarks. The impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth in part driven by decisions to redirect support from these trademarks to other
regional and global brands. We recorded charges related to candy and gum trademarks of $52 million in AMEA, $11 million in Europe, $5 million in Latin America and $2 million in North America. The impairment charges were
calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method,
which utilizes estimates of future sales, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value. We also noted thirteen brands, including the five impaired trademarks, with $963 million of aggregate
book value as of December 31, 2017 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. We believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired, but if we do not meet the product line
expectations or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2016, we recorded charges related to biscuits, candy and gum trademarks
of $41 million in AMEA, $32 million in North America, $22 million in Europe, and $3 million in Latin America. In 2015, we recorded a $44 million charge related to candy and biscuit trademarks in AMEA, $22 million in
Europe and $5 million in Latin America.

Refer to Note 5,

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

, for additional information.

Trade and marketing programs:

We promote our products with trade and sales
incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives as well as cooperative advertising,

in-store

displays and consumer marketing promotions. Trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these
estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated
program spending. We do not defer costs on our

year-end

consolidated balance sheet and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.

Employee Benefit Plans:

We sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout
the world. These include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates;
expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to
the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and
obligations recognized for the underlying plans.

As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. The
cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees
expected to receive benefits.

Since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan
obligations and expenses. The expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses, as many of our pension plans are partially funded. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting
these assumptions are described in Note 9,

Benefit Plans

, to the consolidated financial statements.



While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2018 assumptions for our U.S. and

non-U.S.

pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a

fifty-basis

point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan
assets would have the following effects, increase/(decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs:

Income Taxes:

As a global company, we
calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax
positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our

pre-tax

earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning
opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will
not be realized.

We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. We recognize
tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is
measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and
circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of
historical tax liabilities, whether by settlement with tax authorities, judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and
historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made.

As a result of the U.S. tax reform and the related SEC guidance, we included provisional estimates in our consolidated financial statements for some impacts of the new
tax legislation. We were unable to make a reasonable estimate for other provisions of the legislation and did not include an estimate in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 14,

Income Taxes

, for further discussion of the
provisional amounts related to U.S. tax reform included in our financial statements and a discussion of the items for which no estimate could be made, as well as additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation
allowances and unrecognized tax benefits.

Contingencies:

See Note 12,

Commitments and Contingencies

, to the consolidated financial statements.

New Accounting Guidance:

See Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital
needs, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, share repurchases, transition tax liability on our historical accumulated foreign earnings due to the U.S. tax reform and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. We
continue to utilize our commercial paper program, international credit lines and long-term debt issuances for regular funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Overall,
we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:

Operating activities provided net cash of $2,593 million in 2017, $2,838 million in 2016 and $3,728 million in 2015. Cash flows from operating
activities were lower in 2017 than 2016 primarily due to increases in working capital including higher tax and

VAT-related

payments in 2017 and lower operating cash flows from divested businesses, partially
offset by higher net earnings and lower pension contributions in 2017. Cash flows from operating activities were lower in 2016 than 2015 due to higher contributions to our pension benefit plans in 2016 and higher working capital cash improvements in
2015 than in 2016.

Net Cash Provided by/(Used in) Investing Activities:

Net cash used in investing activities was $301 million in 2017 and $1,029 million in 2016 and net cash provided by investing activities was $2,649 million
in 2015. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2017 relative to 2016 was due to higher net proceeds received from divestitures in 2017, no acquisition-related payments in 2017 as in 2016, and lower capital expenditures in 2017.
The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 primarily relates to $4.7 billion of proceeds, net of divested cash and transaction costs, from the contribution of our global coffee businesses to JDE, the
divestiture of AGF and the cash receipt of $1.0 billion due to the settlement of currency exchange forward contracts related to our coffee business transactions in 2015.

Capital expenditures were $1,014 million in 2017, $1,224 million in 2016 and $1,514 million in 2015. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily
to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2018 capital expenditures to be up to $1.0 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. We
expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:

Net cash used in financing activities was $3,361 million in 2017, $1,862 million in 2016 and $5,883 million in 2015. The increase in net cash used in
financing activities in 2017 relative to 2016 was primarily due to lower net issuances of short-term and long-term debt as well as an increase in dividends paid, partly offset by lower Common Stock repurchases compared to the prior year. The
decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 was primarily due to higher short-term debt issuances and $1.0 billion of lower share repurchases following the exceptional year of share repurchases using proceeds from
the global coffee business transactions in 2015.

Debt:

From time to
time we refinance long-term and short-term debt. Refer to Note 7,

Debt and Borrowing Arrangements

, for details of our tender offers, debt issuances and maturities during 2016-2017. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt
and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to seasonality, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow,
increasing the need for short-term financing. The second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital needs.

During 2016, one of our subsidiaries, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), issued debt totaling $4.5 billion. The operations
held by MIHN generated approximately 74.5% (or $19.3 billion) of the $25.9 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2017 and represented approximately 75.5% (or $19.8 billion) of the $26.2 billion of net assets as of
December 31, 2017.

On February 3, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion long-term financing authority to replace the prior
authority. As of December 31, 2017, we had $4.7 billion of long-term financing authority remaining.



In the next 12 months, we expect $1.2 billion of long-term debt will mature as follows: fr.250 million Swiss
franc notes ($257 million as of December 31, 2017) in January 2018, $478 million in February 2018, £76 million sterling notes ($103 million as of December 31, 2017) in July 2018, and $322 million in August
2018. We expect to fund these repayments with a combination of cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or long-term debt.

Our total debt was
$17.7 billion at December 31, 2017 and $17.2 billion at December 31, 2016. Our

debt-to-capitalization

ratio was 0.40 at December 31, 2017 and
0.41 at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 6.2 years. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $4.4 billion in 2017, $2.2 billion in 2016 and
$2.2 billion in 2015. We had $3.4 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2017 and $2.4 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2016. We expect to continue to use commercial paper to finance various
short and long-term financing needs and to continue to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to Note 7,

Debt and Borrowing Arrangements

, for more information on our debt and debt covenants.

Commodity Trends

We regularly monitor worldwide
supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During 2017, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher currency-related
costs on our commodity purchases and increased costs for dairy, cocoa, sugar, packaging and other raw materials.

A number of external factors such as weather
conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher
commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not
be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Due to competitive or market conditions,
planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.

We expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2018. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe
there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources.



Off-Balance

Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate
Contractual Obligations

We have no significant

off-balance

sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations
discussed below.

Guarantees:

As discussed in Note 12,

Commitments
and Contingencies

, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures.
At December 31, 2017, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.

Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them
to have, a material effect on our liquidity.

Aggregate Contractual Obligations:

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017.

Amounts include the expected cash payments of our debt excluding capital leases, which are presented separately in the table above. The amounts also exclude $64 million of net unamortized

non-cash

bond premiums, discounts, bank fees and

mark-to-market

adjustments related to our interest rate swaps recorded in total debt.

(2)

Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our euro, British pound sterling and Swiss franc notes was forecasted using currency exchange rates as
of December 31, 2017. An insignificant amount of interest expense was excluded from the table for a portion of our other

non-U.S.

debt obligations due to the complexities involved in forecasting expected
interest payments.

(3)

Operating lease payments represent the minimum rental commitments under

non-cancelable

operating leases.

(4)

Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging,

co-manufacturing

arrangements, storage and
distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services.
Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable
without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.

(5)

In connection with the U.S. tax reform, we currently estimate paying a $1.3 billion transition tax liability through 2026. The amounts and timing of our tax payments are likely to change as a result of additional
guidance expected to be issued in 2018. See Note 14,

Income Taxes

, for additional information on the U.S. tax reform and its impact on our financial statements.

(6)

Other long-term liabilities include estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2027 of $235 million. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the
payments beyond 2027; as such, they are excluded from the above table. There are also another $126 million of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next 5 years. In addition, the following long-term
liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, unrecognized tax benefits, insurance accruals and other accruals. As of December 31, 2017, our unrecognized tax benefit, including
associated interest and penalties, classified as a long-term payable is $649 million. We currently expect to make approximately $289 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2018.



Equity and Dividends

Stock Plans:

See Note 10,

Stock Plans

, to the consolidated financial
statements for more information on our stock plans and grant activity during 2015-2017.

Share Repurchases:

See Note 11,

Capital Stock

, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase program.

Between 2013 and 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of a total of $13.7 billion of our Common Stock through December 31, 2018. On
January 31, 2018, our Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase program, raising the authorization to $19.7 billion of Common Stock
repurchases, and extended the program through December 31, 2020. We repurchased approximately $13 billion of shares ($2.2 billion in 2017, $2.6 billion in 2016, $3.6 billion in 2015, $1.9 billion in 2014 and
$2.7 billion in 2013), at a weighted-average cost of $38.86 per share, through December 31, 2017. The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share
price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion.
Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice.

Dividends:

We paid dividends of $1,198 million in 2017,
$1,094 million in 2016 and $1,008 million in 2015. On August 2, 2017, the Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per common share or
$0.88 per common share on an annualized basis. On July 19, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.19 per common share or $0.76 per common share on an annual basis. On July 23, 2015, our Board
of Directors approved a 13% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.17 per common share or $0.68 per common share on an annual basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various
factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.

For U.S. income tax purposes only, the Company has determined that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in 2017 are characterized as a qualified dividend
paid from U.S. earnings and profits. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends.



Non-GAAP

Financial Measures

We use

non-GAAP

financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate
comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use

non-GAAP

financial
measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the

non-GAAP

adjustments that we make in our

non-GAAP

definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition & divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and

non-cash

impairments, major
program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the

non-GAAP

measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and

non-GAAP

financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP results throughout our

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

in this Form

10-K.

Our primary

non-GAAP

financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating
results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related

non-GAAP

historical results on a

.



(1)

When items no longer impact our current or future presentation of

non-GAAP

operating results, we remove these items from our

non-GAAP

definitions. During 2017, we added to the

non-GAAP

definitions the exclusion of: benefits from the resolution of tax matters (see footnote (8) below), CEO transition remuneration (see footnote
(9) below), incremental expenses related to the malware incident (discussed under

Malware Incident

) and the U.S. tax reform discrete impacts (see footnote (10) below).

(2)

Divestitures include completed sales of businesses and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement.

(3)

We continue to have an ongoing interest in the legacy coffee business we deconsolidated in 2015 as part of the JDE coffee business transactions. For historical periods prior to the July 15, 2015 coffee business
deconsolidation, we have reclassified any net revenue or operating income from the historical coffee business and included them where the coffee equity method investment earnings are presented within Adjusted EPS. As such, Organic Net Revenue and
Adjusted Operating Income in all periods do not include the results of our legacy coffee businesses, which are shown within Adjusted EPS.

(4)

Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial
statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.

(5)

Non-GAAP

adjustments related to the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and
organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the

non-GAAP

adjustments. Refer to our Annual Report on Form

10-K

for the
year ended December 31, 2016 for more information on the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program.

(6)

During the third quarter of 2016, we began to exclude unrealized gains and losses

(mark-to-market

impacts) from outstanding commodity and
forecasted currency transaction derivatives from our

non-GAAP

earnings measures until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency
transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we made this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of
our underlying operating performance across periods. We also discontinued designating commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. To facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating results, we have
recast all historical

non-GAAP

earnings measures to exclude the

mark-to-market

impacts.

(7)

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, we began to
record the earnings from our equity method investments in

after-tax

equity method investment earnings outside of operating income following the deconsolidation of our coffee business. Refer to Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,

in our Annual Report on Form

10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2016 for more information.

(8)

During 2017, we recorded benefits from the reversal of tax liabilities in connection with the resolution of a Brazilian indirect tax matter and settlement of

pre-acquisition

Cadbury tax matters. See Note 12,

Commitments and Contingencies—Tax Matters

, for additional information.

(9)

On November 20, 2017, Dirk Van de Put succeeded Irene Rosenfeld as CEO of Mondelēz International in advance of her retirement at the end of March 2018. In order to incent Mr. Van de Put to join us, we
provided him compensation with a total combined target value of $42.5 million to make him whole for incentive awards he forfeited or grants that were not made to him when he left his former employer. The compensation we granted took the form of
cash, deferred stock units, performance share units and stock options. In connection with Irene Rosenfeld’s retirement, we made her outstanding grants of performance share units for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance cycles eligible for
continued vesting and approved a $0.5 million salary for her service as Chairman from January through March 2018. We refer to these elements of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s compensation arrangements together as
“CEO transition remuneration.” We are excluding amounts we expense as CEO transition remuneration from our 2017 and future

non-GAAP

results because those amounts are not part of our regular
compensation program and are incremental to amounts we would have incurred as ongoing CEO compensation. As a result, in 2017, we excluded amounts expensed for the cash payment to Mr. Van de Put and partial vesting of his equity grants. In 2018,
we expect to exclude amounts paid for Ms. Rosenfeld’s service as Chairman and partial vesting of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s equity grants.

(10)

On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions. As further detailed in Note 14,

Income Taxes

, our accounting for the new
legislation is not complete and we have made reasonable estimates for some tax provisions. We exclude the discrete U.S. tax reform impacts from our Adjusted EPS as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under U.S. tax reform.

(11)

We have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ unusual or infrequent items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs, restructuring program costs and discrete U.S. tax reform
impacts, in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. Although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the
underlying operating results and unusual or infrequent items with them each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. Our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted
basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. Our GAAP “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ unusual and infrequent items.

We believe that the presentation of these

non-GAAP

financial measures, when considered together with our U.S.
GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.
Because

non-GAAP

financial measures vary among companies, the

non-GAAP

financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies. Our use of these

non-GAAP

financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. A limitation of these

non-GAAP

financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our

non-GAAP

financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the

non-GAAP

financial measures in this Form

10-K.



Organic Net Revenue:

Applying
the definition of “Organic Net Revenue”, the adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, our historical Venezuelan operations, the adjustment for
deconsolidating our historical coffee business, an accounting calendar change, acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that Organic Net Revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved
comparability of results. We also evaluate our Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and Power Brands, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP below.

Each year we reevaluate our Power Brands and confirm the brands in which we will continue to make disproportionate investments. As such, we may make changes in our planned investments in primarily regional Power Brands
following our annual review cycles. For 2017, we made limited changes to our list of regional Power Brands and as such, we reclassified 2016 and 2015 Power Brand net revenues on a basis consistent with the current list of Power Brands.



Adjusted Operating Income:

Applying the definition of “Adjusted Operating Income”, the adjustments made to “operating income” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure)
were to exclude 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs; 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs; impairment charges related to intangible assets;

mark-to-market

impacts
from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts; incremental expenses related to the malware incident; acquisition integration costs; acquisition-related costs; divestiture-related costs; the operating results of
divestitures; net gain on divestitures; gain on sale of intangible assets; benefits from the resolution of tax matters; CEO transition remuneration; Venezuela historical operating results and remeasurement and deconsolidation losses; the JDE coffee
business transactions gain and net incremental costs; operating income from our historical coffee business and equity method investment earnings reclassified to

after-tax

earnings in Q3 2015 in connection with
the coffee business transactions. We also present “Adjusted Operating Income margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income, and evaluate Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis. We believe
these measures provide improved comparability of underlying operating results.

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with
the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity method
earnings from Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis.



Adjusted EPS:

Applying the
definition of “Adjusted EPS”

(1)

, the adjustments made to “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to
exclude 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs; impairment charges related to intangible assets;

mark-to-market

impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction
derivative contracts; incremental expenses related to the malware incident; acquisition integration costs; divestiture-related costs; net earnings from divestitures;

after-tax

gains/losses on divestitures;
gain on sale of intangible assets; benefits from the resolution of tax matters; CEO transition remuneration; losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; losses on debt
extinguishment and related expenses; U.S. tax reform discrete net tax benefit; Venezuela historical operating results and remeasurement and deconsolidation losses; the JDE coffee business transactions gain, hedging gains and net incremental costs;
operating income from our historical coffee business; equity method investment earnings reclassified to

after-tax

earnings in Q3 2015 in connection with the coffee business transactions; gain on equity method
investment transactions; and our proportionate share of unusual or infrequent items recorded by our JDE and Keurig equity method investees. We also evaluate Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. We believe Adjusted EPS provides improved
comparability of underlying operating results.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as
part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results.
We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative
activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 8,

Financial Instruments

.

Many of our

non-U.S.

subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange
rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of

non-U.S.

dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other
comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we
hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of

non-U.S.

operations and other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes
in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See

Consolidated Results of Operations

and

Results of Operations by Reportable Segment

under

Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results

for currency
exchange effects on our financial results. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, recent currency devaluations, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operation and the historical remeasurement of our Venezuelan net
monetary assets on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting

.

We also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions,
government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions. To manage input cost volatility, we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing
actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.

We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and
expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”), Euro Interbank Offered Rate
(“EURIBOR”) and commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. Our
weighted-average interest rate on our total debt was 2.1% as of December 31, 2017, down from 2.2% as of December 31, 2016.

There were no significant
changes in the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our exposures between

December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. See Note 8,

Financial
Instruments

, for more information on 2017 and 2018 derivative activity.

Value at Risk:

We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential

one-day

loss in the fair value of our interest
rate-sensitive financial instruments; and 2) the potential

one-day

loss in

pre-tax

earnings of our currency and commodity

price-sensitive

derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented
below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the
computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in

non-U.S.

subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned instruments are intended to hedge.



The VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a

one-day

holding period. A parametric delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating
the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange, and commodity price movements over the prior
quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a

one-to-one

basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.

As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the estimated potential

one-day

loss in fair value of our interest
rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential

one-day

loss in

pre-tax

earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in
the VAR model, were:

This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the specified
confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it
consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual
impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results.



Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Mondelēz International, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mondelēz International, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for
these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the
risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.



Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Mondelēz International, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Mondelēz International, Inc. was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Mondelēz International, Inc., through its subsidiaries (collectively
“Mondelēz International,” “we,” “us” and “our”), sells food and beverage products to consumers in approximately 160 countries.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include
Mondelēz International, Inc. as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. The noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling investors’ interests in the results of
subsidiaries that we control and consolidate. Through December 31, 2015, the operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries are included in our consolidated financial statements. As of the close of the fourth quarter of 2015, we
deconsolidated our Venezuelan operations from our consolidated financial statements and recognized a loss on deconsolidation. See

Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting:

Venezuela

below for more information.

We account for investments in which we exercise significant influence under the equity method of accounting. On July 2, 2015, we contributed our global coffee
businesses to a new company, Jacobs Douwe Egberts (“JDE”), in which we now hold an equity interest (collectively, the “JDE coffee business transactions”). Historically, our coffee businesses and the income from equity method
investments were recorded within our operating income as these businesses were part of our base business. While we retain an ongoing interest in coffee through equity method investments including JDE, Keurig Green Mountain Inc. (“Keurig”)
and Dongsuh Foods Corporation (“DSF”), and we have significant influence with our equity method investments, we do not control these operations directly. As such, in the third quarter of 2015, we began to recognize equity method investment
earnings, consisting primarily of investments in coffee businesses, outside of operating income and segment income. For periods prior to the third quarter of 2015, our historical coffee business and equity method investment earnings were included
within our operating income and segment income. (For the six months ended December 31, 2015,

after-tax

equity method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis and thus are
not shown on our consolidated statement of earnings for this period.) Please see Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions – JDE Coffee Business Transactions

,

Keurig Transaction

and

Planned Keurig Dr

Pepper
Transaction

, and Note 16,

Segment Reporting

, for more information on these transactions.

We use the cost method of accounting for investments in which
we do not exercise significant influence or control. Under the cost method of accounting, earnings are recognized to the extent cash is received.

Use of
Estimates:

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”), which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, pension
and benefit plan assumptions, valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, restructuring program liabilities, marketing program accruals, insurance and self-insurance reserves and income taxes. We base
our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known.
Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Segment Change

:

On October 1, 2016, we integrated our Eastern Europe,
Middle East, and Africa (“EEMEA”) operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments to further leverage and optimize the operating scale built within the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey,
Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined within our Europe region, while the remaining Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific region to form a new Asia, Middle East and Africa (“AMEA”) operating
segment. We have reflected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented.



As of October 1, 2016, our operations and management structure were organized into four reportable operating segments:

•

Latin America

•

AMEA

•

Europe

•

North America

See Note 16,

Segment Reporting

, for additional information on our segments.

Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting

:

We translate the
results of operations of our subsidiaries from multiple currencies using average exchange rates during each period and translate balance sheet accounts using exchange rates at the end of each period. We record currency translation adjustments as a
component of equity (except for highly inflationary currencies) and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings.

Highly inflationary accounting
is triggered when a country’s three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeds 100%. It requires the remeasurement of financial statements of subsidiaries in the country, from the functional currency of the subsidiary to our U.S. dollar reporting
currency, with currency remeasurement gains or losses recorded in earnings. In 2017, none of our consolidated subsidiaries were accounted for as highly inflationary economies.

Argentina.

We continue to closely monitor inflation and the potential for the economy to become highly inflationary for accounting purposes. As of
December 31, 2017, the Argentinian economy was not designated as highly inflationary and we continued to record currency translation adjustments within equity and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings. Our Argentinian
operations contributed $601 million, or 2.3% of consolidated net revenues in 2017. The net monetary liabilities of our Argentinian operations as of December 31, 2017 were not material.

Ukraine

. Based on inflation data published by the National Bank of Ukraine, Ukraine’s three-year cumulative inflation rate dropped and remained below 100%
by the end of 2017. As such, Ukraine is no longer highly inflationary and we continue to record currency translation adjustments within equity and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings. Our Ukrainian operations contributed
$73 million, or 0.3%, of consolidated net revenues in 2017. The net monetary assets of our Ukrainian operations as of December 31, 2017 were not material.

Venezuela.

From January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015, we accounted for the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the U.S. dollar as the
functional currency as prescribed by U.S. GAAP for highly inflationary economies.

Effective as of the close of the 2015 fiscal year, we concluded that we no longer
met the accounting criteria for consolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries due to a loss of control over our Venezuelan operations and an other-than-temporary lack of currency exchangeability. The economic and regulatory environment in Venezuela
and the progressively limited access to dollars to import goods through the use of any of the available currency mechanisms impaired our ability to operate and control our Venezuelan businesses. As a result of these factors, we concluded that we no
longer met the criteria for the consolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries.

As of the close of the 2015 fiscal year, we deconsolidated and changed to the cost
method of accounting for our Venezuelan operations. We recorded a $778 million

pre-tax

loss on December 31, 2015 as we reduced the value of our cost method investment in Venezuela and all Venezuelan
receivables held by our other subsidiaries to realizable fair value, resulting in full impairment. The recorded loss also included historical cumulative translation adjustments related to our Venezuelan operations that had previously been recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive losses within equity. The fair value of our investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries was estimated based on discounted cash flow projections of current and expected operating losses in the foreseeable future and
our ability to operate the business on a sustainable basis. Our fair value estimate included U.S. dollar exchange and discount rate assumptions that reflected the inflation and economic uncertainty in Venezuela.

For 2015, the operating results of our Venezuela operations were included in our consolidated statements of earnings. During this time, we recognized a number of
currency-related remeasurement losses resulting from devaluations of the Venezuela bolivar exchange rates we historically used to source U.S. dollars for purchases of imported raw materials, packaging and other goods and services. The following
table sets forth the 2015 remeasurement losses, the deconsolidation loss and historical operating results and financial position of our Venezuelan subsidiaries for the period presented:

Represents the financial position of our Venezuelan subsidiaries on December 31, 2015 prior to deconsolidation.

Beginning in 2016, we no longer included net revenues, earnings or net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries within our consolidated financial statements. Under the
cost method of accounting, earnings are only recognized to the extent cash is received. Given the current and ongoing difficult economic, regulatory and business environment in Venezuela, there continues to be significant uncertainty related to our
operations in Venezuela. In early 2018, the profitability and cash flows of our local operations significantly deteriorated following the issuance of new government price controls. We are engaging with authorities on the pricing restrictions,
however, if the situation is not resolved, it could significantly impede our ability to continue to operate in Venezuela.

Other Countries.

Since we sell our
products in approximately 160 countries and have operations in over 80 countries, we monitor economic and currency-related risks and seek to take protective measures in response to these exposures. Some of the countries in which we do business have
recently experienced periods of significant economic uncertainty and exchange rate volatility, including Brazil, China, Mexico, Russia, United Kingdom (Brexit), Turkey, Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa. We continue to monitor operations, currencies
and net monetary exposures in these countries. At this time, we do not anticipate a risk to our operating results from changing to highly inflationary accounting in these countries.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits
with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Transfers of Financial Assets:

We account for transfers of financial assets, such as uncommitted revolving

non-recourse

accounts receivable factoring
arrangements, when we have surrendered control over the related assets. Determining whether control has transferred requires an evaluation of relevant legal considerations, an assessment of the nature and extent of our continuing involvement with
the assets transferred and any other relevant considerations. We use receivable factoring arrangements periodically when circumstances are favorable to manage liquidity. We have a factoring arrangement with a major global bank for a maximum combined
capacity of $1.0 billion. Under the program, we may sell eligible short-term trade receivables to the bank in exchange for cash. We then continue to collect the receivables sold, acting solely as a collecting agent on behalf of the bank. The
outstanding principal amount of receivables under this arrangement amounted to $804 million as of December 31, 2017, $644 million as of December 31, 2016 and $570 million as of December 31, 2015. The incremental cost of
factoring receivables under this arrangement were no more than $6 million in each of the years presented. The proceeds from the sales of receivables are included in cash from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Accounting Calendar Change:

In connection with moving toward a common
consolidation date across the Company, in the first quarter of 2015, we changed the consolidation date for our North America segment from the last Saturday of each period to the last calendar day of each period. The change had a favorable impact of
$76 million on net revenues and $36 million on operating income in 2015. As a result of this change, each of our operating subsidiaries now reports results as of the last calendar day of the period.



Inventories:

We value our
inventory using the average cost method. We also record inventory allowances for overstock and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes.

Long-Lived Assets:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical
cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 20 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to
40 years.

We review long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for realizability on an ongoing basis. Changes in depreciation, generally
accelerated depreciation, are determined and recorded when estimates of the remaining useful lives or residual values of long-term assets change. We also review for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may
not be fully recoverable. In those circumstances, we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for asset impairment, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows
are separately identifiable. Any impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value. Fair value is estimated based on the discounted cash flows for the asset group over the remaining useful
life or based on the expected cash proceeds for the asset less costs of disposal. Any significant impairment losses would be recorded within asset impairment and exit costs in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Software Costs:

We capitalize certain computer software and software
development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
of the software, which do not exceed seven years.

Goodwill and

Non-Amortizable

Intangible Assets:

We have historically annually tested goodwill and

non-amortizable

intangible assets for impairment as of October 1. In 2017,
we voluntarily changed the annual impairment assessment date from October 1 to July 1. We believe this measurement date, which represents a change in the method of applying an accounting principle, is preferable because it better aligns
with our strategic business planning process and financial forecasts, which are key components of the annual impairment tests. The change in the measurement date did not delay, accelerate or prevent an impairment charge. Each quarter, we have
evaluated goodwill and intangible asset impairment risks and recognized any related impairments to date. As such, the change in the annual test date was applied on July 1, 2017.

We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting
our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such
as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value
with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North
America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 7.2% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 10.2%.
Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of
a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.

Annually we assess

non-amortizable

intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and
circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated
fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, we consider the asset impaired
and reduce its carrying value to the estimated fair value. We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and evaluate them for impairment as we do other long-lived assets.



Insurance and Self-Insurance:

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, product
liability and our obligation for employee healthcare benefits. We estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an undiscounted basis by evaluating and making judgments about historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions and
the estimated impact on future results.

Revenue Recognition:

We
predominantly sell food and beverage products across several product categories and in all regions as disclosed in Note 16,

Segment Reporting

. We recognize revenue when control over the products transfers to our customers, which generally
occurs upon delivery or shipment of the products. We account for product shipping, handling and insurance as fulfillment activities with revenues for these activities recorded within net revenue and costs recorded within cost of sales. Any taxes
collected on behalf of government authorities are excluded from net revenues. A small percentage of our net revenues relates to the licensing of our intellectual property, predominantly brand and trade names, and we record these revenues over the
license term.

Revenues are recorded net of trade and sales incentives and estimated product returns. Known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments, such as
trade discounts, rebates or returns, are estimated at the time of sale. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. Estimates that affect revenue, such as trade incentives and product returns, are monitored
and adjusted each period until the incentives or product returns are realized.

Key sales terms, such as pricing and quantities ordered, are established on a very
frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a one year or shorter duration. As such, we do not capitalize contract inception costs and we capitalize product fulfillment costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our
inventory policies. We do not have any significant unbilled receivables at the end of any period. Deferred revenues are not material and primarily include customer advance payments typically collected a few days before product delivery, at which
time, deferred revenues are reclassified and recorded as net revenues. We generally do not receive noncash consideration for the sale of goods nor do we grant payment financing terms greater than one year.

Marketing, Advertising and Research and Development:

We promote our products
with marketing and advertising programs. These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperative advertising,

in-store

displays and consumer marketing promotions. For interim reporting purposes,
advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our

year-end

consolidated balance sheet and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred. Advertising expense was $1,248 million in 2017, $1,396 million in 2016 and $1,542 million in 2015. We expense product
research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expense was $366 million in 2017, $376 million in 2016 and $409 million in 2015. We record marketing and advertising as well as research and development expenses
within selling, general and administrative expenses.

Stock-based Compensation:

Stock-based compensation awarded to employees and

non-employee

directors is valued at fair value on the grant date. We record
stock-based compensation expense over the vesting period, generally three years. Forfeitures are estimated on the grant date for all of our stock-based compensation awards.

Employee Benefit Plans:

We provide a range of benefits to our current and
retired employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits depending upon jurisdiction, tenure, job level and other factors. Local statutory requirements govern many of the benefit plans we
provide around the world. Local government plans generally cover health care benefits for retirees outside the United States, Canada and United Kingdom. Our U.S., Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries provide health care and other benefits to most retired
employees. Our postemployment benefit plans provide primarily severance benefits for eligible salaried and certain hourly employees. The cost for these plans is recognized in earnings primarily over the working life of the covered employee.



Financial Instruments:

We use
financial instruments to manage our currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and
seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. A principal objective of our risk management strategies is to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may
arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates, principally through the use of derivative instruments.

We use a combination
of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and
liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 8,

Financial Instruments,

for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use.

We
record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis and at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets within other current assets or other current liabilities due to their relatively short-term duration. Cash flows from derivative
instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the derivative instrument. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective,
are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period
earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge, along with the changes in the fair value of the related hedged asset or liability, are recorded in earnings in the same period. We use

non-U.S.

dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in

non-U.S.

operations against adverse movements in exchange rates, with currency movements related
to the debt and net investment and the related deferred taxes recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).

In order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception
and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of
assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted
transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.

When we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its
performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the
financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant,

non-exchange

traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an
International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange
rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.

Commodity derivatives

. We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter into
commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities
under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable oils. We
also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for
speculative purposes. During the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued designating commodity derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. Any unrealized gains or losses

(mark-to-market

impacts) and realized gains or losses are recorded in earnings.



Currency exchange derivatives

. We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange
rates from third-party and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and location of our businesses, we use these instruments to
hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. During the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued designating currency exchange derivatives for hedge accounting treatment.
Any unrealized gains or losses

(mark-to-market

impacts) and realized gains or losses are recorded in earnings (see Note 8,

Financial Instruments

, for additional
information).

Interest rate cash flow and fair value hedges

. We manage interest rate volatility by modifying the pricing or
maturity characteristics of certain liabilities so that the net impact on expense is not, on a material basis, adversely affected by movements in interest rates. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate liabilities appreciate or
depreciate in market value. We expect the effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation to be substantially offset by our gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to these hedged liabilities. We use derivative
instruments, including interest rate swaps that have indices related to the pricing of specific liabilities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. As a matter of policy, we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments for
interest rate risk management. We use interest rate swaps to economically convert a portion of our fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. Under the interest rate swap contracts, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the
difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts, which is calculated based on an agreed-upon notional amount. We use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our future debt
obligations. We also execute cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge interest payments on newly issued debt denominated in a different currency than the functional currency of the borrowing entity. Substantially all of these derivative
instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

Hedges of net investments in

non-U.S.

operations

. We have numerous investments outside the United States. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to changes and volatility in currency exchange rates. We use local currency denominated debt to hedge our

non-U.S.

net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. We designated our euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc denominated borrowings as a net investment hedge of a portion of our overall European
operations. The gains and losses on our net investment in these designated European operations are economically offset by losses and gains on our euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc denominated borrowings. The change in the debt’s value, net
of deferred taxes, is recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses).

Income Taxes:

Our provision for income taxes includes amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effects of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of our assets and liabilities, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse.

The
realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is
more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider any carryback potential, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences
(including liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits), future taxable income and tax planning strategies.

We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements
from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than
50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. Future changes related to the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions could affect tax expense in the period when the change occurs.



We monitor for changes in tax laws and reflect the impacts of tax law changes in the period of enactment. In response to
the United States tax reform legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 (“U.S. tax reform”), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued guidance that allows us to record provisional amounts for the impacts of
U.S. tax reform if the full accounting cannot be completed before we file our 2017 financial statements. For provisions of the tax law where we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the impact, the guidance allows us to continue to apply the
historical tax provisions in computing our income tax liability and deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017. The guidance also allows us to finalize accounting for the U.S. tax reform changes within one year of the
December 22,

2017 enactment date. See Note 14,

Income Taxes

, for additional information on how we recorded the impacts of the U.S. tax reform.

New Accounting Pronouncements:

In August 2017, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) to simplify the application of hedge accounting and increase the transparency of hedge results. The updated standard changes how companies can assess the
effectiveness of their hedging relationships. For cash flow and net investment hedges as of the adoption date, the ASU requires a modified retrospective transition approach. Presentation and disclosure requirements related to this ASU are required
prospectively. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We intend to early adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2018 and we do not expect it to have a significant impact on
our consolidated financial statements, including the cumulative-effect adjustment required upon adoption.

In May 2017, the FASB issued an ASU to clarify when
changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The ASU is applied prospectively to awards that are modified on or after the adoption date. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the standard on January 1, 2018 and we do not expect a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2017, the FASB issued an ASU to amend the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium, shortening the period to the
earliest call date instead of the maturity date. The standard does not impact securities held at a discount as the discount continues to be amortized to maturity. The ASU is applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect
adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the standard on January 1, 2019.
We do not expect a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2017, the FASB issued an ASU to improve the presentation of net periodic
pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The standard requires employers to disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost and disclose the amount and location where the net benefit cost is
recorded in the income statement or capitalized in assets. The standard is to be applied on a retrospective basis for the change in presentation in the income statement and prospectively for the change in presentation on the balance sheet. The ASU
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the standard on January 1, 2018. We will reclassify net benefit costs other than service costs below operating income, with no
impact to our net earnings. For information on our service cost and other components of net periodic benefit cost for pension, postretirement benefit and postemployment plans, see Note 9,

Benefit Plans

.

In January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU that clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist companies with evaluating whether
transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business may affect many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill and consolidation. The ASU is applied on a
prospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018 and we do not expect a material impact to our consolidated financial
statements.

In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that requires the change in restricted cash or cash equivalents to be included with other changes in cash and
cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018 and we do not expect a material impact
on our consolidated statements of cash flows.



In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that requires the recognition of tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers
other than inventory when the transfer occurs and removes the exception to postpone recognition until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The standard is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment
directly to retained earnings. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018 and we do not expect a material impact to our
consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to provide guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues and reduce
diversity in practice in how some cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt
this standard on January 1, 2018 and we do not expect a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU on
lease accounting. The ASU revises existing U.S. GAAP and outlines a new model for lessors and lessees to use in accounting for lease contracts. The guidance requires lessees to recognize a

right-of-use

asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. In the statement of earnings, lessees will classify leases as either operating (resulting
in straight-line expense) or financing (resulting in a front-loaded expense pattern). The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We anticipate adopting the new standard on
January 1, 2019. We continue to make progress in our due diligence and assess the impact of the new standard across our operations and on our consolidated financial statements, which will consist primarily of recording lease assets and
liabilities on our balance sheet for our operating leases.

In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that provides updated guidance for the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. The standard requires that equity investments (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) be measured at
fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The standard also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017. We will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018 and we do not expect a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU on revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The ASU outlines a new, single comprehensive model for companies to use in
accounting for revenue. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control over promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to
receive in exchange for the goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from customer contracts, including significant judgments made in recognizing
revenue. In 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued several ASUs that clarified principal versus agent (gross versus net) revenue presentation considerations, confirmed the accounting for certain prepaid stored-value products and clarified the guidance for
identifying performance obligations within a contract, the accounting for licenses and partial sales of nonfinancial assets. The FASB also issued two ASUs providing technical corrections, narrow scope exceptions and practical expedients to clarify
and improve the implementation of the new revenue recognition guidance. The revenue guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date (annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016). The ASU may be applied retrospectively to historical periods presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018 on
a full retrospective basis. There was no material financial impact from adopting the new revenue standards.

Note 2. Divestitures and Acquisitions

JDE Coffee Business Transactions:

On July 2, 2015, we completed
transactions to combine our wholly owned coffee businesses with those of D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V. (“DEMB”) to create a new company, JDE. Through March 7, 2016, we held a 43.5% interest in JDE. Following the March 7, 2016
exchange of a portion of our investment in JDE for an interest in Keurig, we held a 26.5% equity interest in JDE. (See discussion under

Keurig Transaction

below.) The remaining 73.5% equity interest in JDE was held by a subsidiary of Acorn
Holdings B.V. (“AHBV,” owner of DEMB prior to July 2, 2015). Following the transactions



discussed under

JDE Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements

below, as of December 31, 2017, we hold a 26.5% voting interest, a 26.4% ownership interest and a 26.2% profit and dividend
sharing interest in JDE. We recorded JDE equity earnings of $129 million in 2017 and $100 million in 2016 and equity losses of $58 million in 2015. We also recorded $49 million of cash dividends received during the first quarter
of 2017.

The consideration we received in the JDE coffee business transactions completed on July 2, 2015 consisted of

€

3.8 billion of cash ($4.2 billion as of July 2, 2015), a 43.5% equity interest in JDE and $794 million in receivables (related to sales price adjustments and tax formation
cost payments). During the third quarter of 2015, we also recorded $283 million of cash and receivables from JDE related to reimbursement of costs that we incurred in separating our coffee businesses. The cash and equity consideration we
received at closing reflects our retaining our interest in our Korea-based joint venture, DSF. During the second quarter of 2015, we also completed the sale of our interest in a Japanese coffee joint venture, Ajinomoto General Foods, Inc.
(“AGF”). In lieu of contributing our interest in the AGF joint venture to JDE, we contributed the net cash proceeds from this sale as part of the overall JDE coffee business transactions.

On July 5, 2016, we received an expected cash payment of $275 million from JDE to settle the receivable related to tax formation costs that were part of the
initial sales price.

In connection with the contribution of our global coffee businesses to JDE on July 2, 2015, we recorded a final

pre-tax

gain of $6.8 billion (or $6.6 billion

after-tax)

in 2015 after final adjustments described below. As previously reported, we deconsolidated net assets
totaling $2.9 billion and reduced accumulated other comprehensive losses for the transfer of coffee business-related pension obligations by $90 million. We also recorded approximately $1.0 billion of

pre-tax

net gains related to hedging the expected cash proceeds from the transactions as described further below. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we and JDE concluded negotiations of a sales price
adjustment and completed the valuation of our investment in JDE. Primarily due to the negotiated resolution of the sales price adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $313 million reduction in the

pre-tax

gain on the coffee transaction, reducing the $7.1 billion estimated gain in the third quarter of 2015 to the $6.8 billion final gain for 2015. As part of our sales price negotiations, we
retained the right to collect future cash payments if certain estimated pension liabilities are realized over an agreed amount in the future. As such, we may recognize additional income related to this negotiated term in the future.

The final value of our 43.5% investment in JDE on July 2, 2015 was

€

4.1 billion ($4.5 billion as of
July 2, 2015). The fair value of the JDE investment was determined using both income-based and market-based valuation techniques. The discounted cash flow analysis reflected growth, discount and tax rates and other assumptions reflecting the
underlying combined businesses and countries in which the combined coffee businesses operate. The fair value of the JDE investment also included the fair values of the

Carte Noire

and

Merrild

businesses, which JDE agreed to divest to
comply with the conditioned approval by the European Commission related to the JDE coffee business transactions. As of the end of the first quarter of 2016, these businesses were sold by JDE. As the July 2, 2015 fair values for these businesses
were recorded by JDE at their pending sales values, we did not record any gain or loss on the sales of these businesses in our share of JDE’s earnings.

In
2014 and 2015, in connection with the expected receipt of cash in euros at the time of closing, we entered into a number of consecutive currency exchange forward contracts to lock in an equivalent expected value in U.S. dollars as of the date the
JDE coffee business transactions were first announced in May 2014. Cumulatively, we realized aggregate net gains and received cash of approximately $1.0 billion on these hedging contracts that increased the cash we received in connection with
the JDE coffee business transactions from $4.2 billion in cash consideration received to $5.2 billion. In connection with these currency contracts and the transfer of the sale proceeds to our subsidiaries that deconsolidated net assets and
shares, we recognized a net gain of $436 million in 2015 within interest and other expense, net.

We also incurred incremental expenses related to readying our
global coffee businesses for the transactions that totaled $278 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Of these total expenses, $123 million was recorded within asset impairment and exit costs in 2015 and the remainder was
recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses of primarily our Europe segment, as well as within general corporate expenses.

JDE Capital
Increase:

On December 18, 2015, AHBV and we agreed to provide JDE additional capital to pay down some of its debt with lenders. Our pro rata share of the
capital increase was

€

499 million ($544 million as of December 18, 2015) and was made in return for a pro rata number of additional shares in JDE such that our ownership in JDE did
not change following the capital increase. To fund our share of the capital increase, we contributed

€

460 million ($501 million) of JDE receivables and made a

€

39 million ($43 million) cash payment.



JDE Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements:

On June 30, 2016, we entered into agreements with AHBV and its affiliates to establish a new stock-based compensation arrangement tied to the issuance of JDE equity
compensation awards to JDE employees. This arrangement replaced a temporary equity compensation program tied to the issuance of AHBV equity compensation to JDE employees. New Class C, D and E JDE shares were authorized and issued for
investments made by, and vested stock-based compensation awards granted to, JDE employees. Under these arrangements, share ownership dilution from the JDE Class C, D and E shareholders is limited to 2%. We retained our 26.5% voting rights and
have a slightly lower portion of JDE’s profits and dividends than our shareholder ownership interest as certain employee shareholders receive a slightly larger share. Upon execution of the agreements and the creation of the Class C, D and
E JDE shares, as a percentage of the total JDE issued shares, our Class B shares decreased from 26.5% to 26.4% and AHBV’s Class A shares decreased from 73.5% to 73.22%, while the Class C, D and E shares, held by AHBV and its
affiliates until the JDE employee awards vest, comprised 0.38% of JDE’s shares. Additional Class C shares are available to be issued when planned long-term incentive plan (“JDE LTIP”) awards vest, generally over the next five
years. When the JDE Class C shares are issued in connection with the vested JDE LTIP awards, the Class A and B relative ownership interests will decrease. Based on estimated achievement and forfeiture assumptions, we do not expect our JDE
ownership interest to decrease below 26.27%.

JDE Tax Matter Resolution:

On July 19, 2016, the Supreme Court of Spain reached a final resolution on a challenged JDE tax position held by a predecessor DEMB company that resulted in an
unfavorable tax expense of

€

114 million. As a result, our share of JDE’s equity earnings during the third quarter of 2016 was negatively affected by

€

30 million ($34 million).

Keurig Transaction:

On March 3, 2016, a subsidiary of AHBV completed a $13.9 billion acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of Keurig through a merger transaction. On
March 7, 2016, we exchanged with a subsidiary of AHBV a portion of our equity interest in JDE with a carrying value of

€

1.7 billion (approximately $2.0 billion as of March 7,
2016) for an interest in Keurig with a fair value of $2.0 billion based on the merger consideration per share for Keurig. We recorded the difference between the fair value of Keurig and our basis in JDE shares as a $43 million gain on the
equity method investment exchange in March 2016. Immediately following the exchange, our ownership interest in JDE was 26.5% and our interest in Keurig was 24.2%. Both AHBV and we hold our investments in Keurig through a combination of equity and
interests in a shareholder loan, with

pro-rata

ownership of each. Our initial $2.0 billion investment in Keurig includes a $1.6 billion Keurig equity interest and a $0.4 billion shareholder loan
receivable, which are reported on a combined basis within equity method investments on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. The shareholder loan has a 5.5% interest rate and is payable at the end of a seven-year term on
February 27, 2023. We recorded Keurig equity earnings of $208 million in 2017 (of which, approximately $119 million relates to the provisional tax benefit Keurig recorded as a result of U.S. tax reform), and $77 million in 2016.
We recorded shareholder loan interest of $24 million in 2017 and $20 million in 2016. Additionally, we received shareholder loan interest payments of $30 million in 2017 and $14 million in 2016 and dividends of $14 million
in 2017 and $4 million in 2016.

Planned Keurig Dr Pepper Transaction

:

On January 29, 2018, we announced that we would exchange our ownership interest in Keurig for equity in Keurig Dr Pepper, which is contingent upon the successful
completion of a planned merger of Keurig with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. Following the close of the merger in

mid-2018,

we expect our ownership in Keurig Dr Pepper to be

13-14%.

We expect to account for this new investment under the equity method as we have for Keurig, resulting in our recognizing our share of their earnings within our earnings and our share of their dividends
within our cash flows. We will have the right to nominate two directors to the board of Keurig Dr Pepper and will have certain governance rights over Keurig Dr Pepper following the transaction.

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with
the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in

after-tax

equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. For the six months ended
December 31, 2015,

after-tax

equity method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis. Earnings from equity method investments recorded within segment operating income were
$56 million for the six months ended July 2, 2015. See Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Principles of Consolidation,

for additional information.

Other Divestitures and Acquisitions

:

On December 28, 2017, we completed
the sale of a confectionery business in Japan. We received cash proceeds of ¥2.8 billion Japanese Yen ($24 million as of December 28, 2017) and recorded an immaterial

pre-tax

loss on the
divestiture within our AMEA segment.

On October 2, 2017, we completed the sale of one of our equity method investments and received cash proceeds of
$65 million. We recorded a

pre-tax

gain of $40 million within the gain on equity method investment transactions and $15 million of tax expense.



In connection with the 2012

spin-off

of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (now a part of The
Kraft Heinz Company (“KHC”)), Kraft Foods Group and we each granted the other various licenses to use certain trademarks in connection with particular product categories in specified jurisdictions. On August 17, 2017, we entered into
two agreements with KHC to terminate the licenses of certain

KHC-owned

brands used in our grocery business within our Europe region and to transfer to KHC inventory and certain other assets. On August 17,
2017, the first transaction closed and we received cash proceeds of

€

9 million ($11 million as of August 17, 2017) and on October 23, 2017, the second transaction closed and
we received cash proceeds of

€

2 million ($3 million as of October 23, 2017). The gain on both transactions combined was immaterial.

On July 4, 2017, we completed the sale of most of our grocery business in Australia and New Zealand to Bega Cheese Limited for $456 million Australian dollars
($347 million as of July 4, 2017). We divested $27 million of current assets, $135 million of

non-current

assets and $4 million of current liabilities based on the July 4, 2017
exchange rate. We recorded a

pre-tax

gain of $247 million Australian dollars ($187 million as of July 4, 2017) on the sale. We also recorded divestiture-related costs of $2 million and a
foreign currency hedge loss of $3 million during 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a $3 million inventory-related working capital adjustment, increasing the

pre-tax

gain to
$190 million in 2017.

On April 28, 2017, we completed the sale of several manufacturing facilities in France and the sale or license of several local
confectionery brands. We received cash of approximately

€

157 million ($169 million as of April 28, 2017), net of cash divested with the businesses. On April 28, 2017, we
divested $44 million of current assets, $155 million of

non-current

assets, $8 million of current liabilities and $22 million of

non-current

liabilities based on the April 28, 2017 exchange rate. We recorded a $3 million loss on the sale and divestiture-related costs of $27 million in 2017 and $84 million in 2016. These divestiture-related costs were recorded within
cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses primarily within our Europe segment. In prior periods, we recorded a $5 million impairment charge in May 2016 for a candy trademark to reduce the overall net assets to the estimated
net sales proceeds after transaction costs. On March 31, 2016, we recorded a $14 million impairment charge for another gum & candy trademark as a portion of its carrying value would not be recoverable based on future cash flows
expected under a planned license agreement with the buyer.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also completed the following sale transactions:

•

On December 31, 2016, we completed the sale of a chocolate factory in Belgium. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a

pre-tax

loss of

€

65 million ($68 million as of December 31, 2016), within asset impairment and exit costs in our Europe segment. The loss includes a fixed asset impairment charge of

€

30 million ($31 million as of December 31, 2016), a loss on disposal of

€

22 million ($23 million as of December 31,
2016) and incremental expenses we incurred and accrued of

€

13 million ($14 million as of December 31, 2016) related to selling the factory.

•

On December 1, 2016, we completed the sale of a confectionery business in Costa Rica represented by a local brand. The sales price was $28 million and we recorded a

pre-tax

gain of $9 million within gains on divestiture within our Latin America segment. We divested approximately $11 million of property, plant and equipment, $4 million of goodwill and
$2 million of inventory. In connection with this transaction, we incurred $2 million of transaction costs and accrued expenses.

•

On August 26, 2016, we recorded a $7 million gain for the sale of a U.S.-owned biscuit trademark. The gain was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016.

•

On May 2, 2016, we completed the sale of certain local biscuit brands in Finland as part of our strategic decisions to exit select small and local brands and shift investment towards our Power Brands. The sales
price was

€

14 million ($16 million as of May 2, 2016) and we recorded a

pre-tax

gain of $6 million ($5 million after tax) within
selling, general and administrative expenses of our Europe segment in the year ended December 31, 2016. We divested $8 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets and less than $1 million of other assets. We received cash proceeds
of

€

12 million ($14 million as of May 2, 2016) upon closing and another

€

2 million ($2 million as of
October 31, 2016) of consideration following the completion of post-closing requirements. The additional $2 million of consideration increased the

pre-tax

gain to $8 million ($6 million
after tax) through December 31, 2016.



On November 2, 2016, we purchased from Burton’s Biscuit Company certain intangibles, which included the license
to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits in additional key markets around the world, including in the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, North America and Saudi Arabia. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Total
cash paid for the acquired assets was £199 million ($245 million as of November 2, 2016). During the third quarter of 2017, we completed the valuation work and finalized the purchase price allocation of $66 million to
definite-lived intangible assets, $173 million to goodwill, $2 million to property, plant and equipment and $4 million to inventory, reflecting a November 2, 2016 exchange rate. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of
$59 million in 2017 and $16 million in 2016 and added incremental operating income of $8 million in 2017 and $1 million in 2016.

During the
third quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisition of a Vietnamese biscuit operation within our AMEA segment. On July 15, 2015, we acquired an 80% interest in the biscuit operation and on August 22, 2016, we acquired the remaining 20%
interest. Total cash paid for the biscuit operation, intellectual property,

non-compete

and consulting agreements less purchase price adjustments was 12,404 billion Vietnamese dong ($569 million
using applicable exchange rates on July 15, 2015, November 27, 2015 and August 22, 2016). On August 22, 2016, in connection with acquiring the remaining 20% interest in the biscuit operation, escrowed funds of
$70 million were released and we retained an agreed $20 million related to two outstanding acquisition-related matters. We subsequently released $5 million in 2016 and $9 million in 2017 to the sellers and expect to pay
$4 million within five years as remaining indemnified obligations are resolved. On August 22, 2016, we also made a final payment of 759 billion Vietnamese dong ($35 million as of August 22, 2016) for the

non-compete

and consulting agreements. The

non-compete

and consulting agreements were recorded as prepaid contracts within other current and

non-current

assets and will be amortized into net earnings over the term of the agreements. During the third quarter of 2016, we also finalized the valuation and purchase price allocation of the acquired net
assets of the business, which included $10 million of inventory, $49 million of property, plant and equipment, $86 million of intangible assets, $385 million of goodwill and $31 million of other net liabilities. In periods
following the initial July 15, 2015 first closing date, the allocation of the net asset fair values had an immaterial impact on our operating results. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of $71 million in 2016 and
$121 million in 2015 and added incremental operating income of $5 million in 2016 and $21 million in 2015. Within selling, general and administrative expenses, we recorded integration costs of $7 million in 2016 and
$9 million in 2015 and acquisition costs of $7 million in 2015.

Sales of Property:

On November 9, 2016, we completed the sale of a manufacturing plant in Russia and recorded total expenses of $12 million, including a related fixed asset
impairment charge of $4 million within asset impairments and exit costs. The sale of the land, buildings and equipment generated cash proceeds of $6 million.

In 2016, we also sold property within our North America segment and from our centrally held corporate assets. In the third quarter of 2016, we sold property in North
America that generated cash proceeds of $10 million and a

pre-tax

gain of $6 million and we sold a corporate aircraft hangar that generated cash proceeds of $3 million and a

pre-tax

gain of $1 million. In the second quarter of 2016, we also sold property within our North America segment and from our centrally held corporate assets. The North America sale generated cash proceeds of
$40 million and a

pre-tax

gain of $33 million. The corporate aircraft sale generated cash proceeds of $20 million and a

pre-tax

gain of $6 million.
The gains were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses and cash proceeds were recorded in cash flows from other investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016.

Changes to goodwill and intangibles were:

•

Divestitures – During 2017, in connection with the divestiture of several manufacturing facilities, primarily in France, we divested $23 million of goodwill and $62 million of amortizable and

non-amortizable

intangible assets. In 2017, we also completed a sale of most of our grocery business in Australia and New Zealand and divested $86 million of related goodwill. Furthermore, we completed a sale
of a confectionery business in Japan and divested $5 million of goodwill and $24 million of definite lived intangible assets. Finally, we divested $14 million of definite lived intangible asset as part of our sale of one of our equity
method investments. During 2016, we divested $4 million of goodwill related to the sale of a confectionery business in Costa Rica and we sold $8 million of

non-amortizable

intangible assets in
Finland. See Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions

, for additional information.

•

Acquisitions – During 2017, we recorded a $15 million adjustment to goodwill and a $7 million adjustment to indefinite lived assets in connection with finalizing the valuation and purchase price
allocation for the Burton’s Biscuit Company purchase completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. In connection with the completion of the purchase of a Vietnam biscuit operation in 2016, we finalized the purchase price allocation of the
consideration paid to the net assets acquired and recorded $25 million of amortizable intangible assets and $61 million of

non-amortizable

intangible assets related to acquired trademarks and
customer-related intangible assets. A preliminary goodwill balance was recorded in 2015 and subsequently adjusted by $76 million to $385 million in 2016 to reflect finalized intangible asset and other asset fair valuations. See Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions

, for additional information.



•

Asset impairments – We recorded $109 million of intangible asset impairments in 2017, $137 million in 2016 and $83 million in 2015. Charges related to our annual testing of

non-amortizable

intangible assets were $70 million in 2017, $98 million in 2016 and $71 million in 2015. During 2017, we also recorded a $38 million intangible asset impairment charge resulting
from a category decline and lower than expected product growth related to a gum trademark in our North America segment and a $1 million intangible asset impairment charge related to a transaction. In 2016, we also recorded $20 million of
impairment charges within our Europe segment related to the planned sale of a confectionery business in France (see Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions – Other Divestitures and Acquisitions

, for additional information) and we also
recorded $19 million of charges in our Europe, North America and AMEA segments resulting from the discontinuation of four biscuit products and one candy product. In 2015, we recorded $12 million of impairment charges within the loss on
deconsolidation of Venezuela related to a biscuit trademark.

We have historically annually tested goodwill and

non-amortizable

intangible assets for impairment as of October 1. This year, we voluntarily changed the annual impairment assessment date from October 1 to July 1. We believe this measurement date, which
represents a change in the method of applying an accounting principle, is preferable because it better aligns with our strategic business planning process and financial forecasts, which are key components of the annual impairment tests. The change
in the measurement date did not delay, accelerate or prevent an impairment charge. Each quarter, we have evaluated goodwill and intangible asset impairment risks and recognized any related impairments to date. As such, the change in the annual
test date was applied on July 1, 2017.

In 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were no goodwill impairments and each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in
excess of its carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change
significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.

During our 2017
annual testing of

non-amortizable

intangible assets, we recorded $70 million of impairment charges in the third quarter related to five trademarks. We also noted thirteen brands, including the five
impaired trademarks, with $963 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2017 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. We believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not
be impaired, but if the product line expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future.

Note 6. 2014-2018 Restructuring Program

On May 6, 2014, our Board of
Directors approved a $3.5 billion restructuring program and up to $2.2 billion of capital expenditures. On August 31, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $600 million reallocation between restructuring program cash costs and
capital expenditures so that now the $5.7 billion program consists of approximately $4.1 billion of restructuring program costs ($3.1 billion cash costs and $1 billion

non-cash

costs) and
up to $1.6 billion of capital expenditures. The primary objective of the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program is to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. The program is intended primarily to cover severance
as well as asset disposals and other manufacturing-related

one-time

costs. Since inception, we have incurred total restructuring and related implementation charges of $3.3 billion related to the 2014-2018
Restructuring Program. We expect to incur the full $4.1 billion of program charges by

year-end

2018.



Restructuring Costs

:

We
recorded restructuring charges of $535 million in 2017, $714 million in 2016 and $711 million in 2015 within asset impairment and exit costs. The 2014-2018 Restructuring Program liability activity for the years ended December 31,

We spent $347 million in 2017 and $315 million in 2016 in cash severance and related costs. We also recognized

pension settlement losses (See Note 9,

Benefit Plans)

,

non-cash

asset write-downs (including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments) and other

non-cash

adjustments totaling $215 million in 2017 and $321 million in 2016. At December 31, 2017, $412 million of our net restructuring liability was recorded within other current liabilities
and $52 million was recorded within other long-term liabilities.

Implementation Costs:

Implementation costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities.
We believe the disclosure of implementation costs provides readers of our financial statements with more information on the total costs of our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. Implementation costs primarily relate to reorganizing our operations and
facilities in connection with our supply chain reinvention program and other identified productivity and cost saving initiatives. The costs include incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities, costs to terminate certain contracts and
the simplification of our information systems. Within our continuing results of operations, we recorded implementation costs of $257 million in 2017, $372 million in 2016 and $291 million in 2015. We recorded these costs within cost
of sales and general corporate expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.



Restructuring and Implementation Costs in Operating Income:

During 2017, 2016 and 2015, and since inception of the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, we recorded restructuring and implementation costs within operating income by

As of December 31, 2017, commercial paper issued and outstanding had between 2 and 75 days remaining to maturity. Commercial
paper borrowings increased since the 2016

year-end

primarily as a result of issuances to finance the payment of long-term debt maturities, dividend payments and share repurchases during the year.

Bank loans include borrowings on primarily uncommitted credit lines maintained by some of our international subsidiaries to meet short-term working capital needs.
Collectively, these credit lines amounted to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017 and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2016. Borrowings on these lines were $107 million at December 31, 2017 and $160 million at
December 31, 2016.



Borrowing Arrangements:

On
March 1, 2017, to supplement our commercial paper program, we entered into a $1.5 billion revolving credit agreement for a

364-day

senior unsecured credit facility that is scheduled to expire on
February 28, 2018. The agreement includes the same terms and conditions as our existing $4.5 billion multi-year credit facility discussed below. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn on the facility.

We also maintain a $4.5 billion multi-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs, and to
support our commercial paper program. On October 14, 2016, the revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to expire on October 11, 2018, was extended through October 11, 2021. The revolving credit agreement includes a covenant
that we maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity of at least $24.6 billion, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) and the cumulative effects of any changes in accounting principles. At December 31, 2017, we
complied with this covenant as our shareholders’ equity, as defined by the covenant, was $36.1 billion. The revolving credit facility agreement also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. There are no credit
rating triggers, provisions or other financial covenants that could require us to post collateral as security. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn on the facility.

On April 12, 2017, we discharged $488 million of our 6.500% U.S. dollar-denominated debt. We paid $504 million,
representing principal as well as past and future interest accruals from February 2017 through the August 2017 maturity date. We recorded an $11 million loss on debt extinguishment within interest expense and a $5 million reduction in
accrued interest.

On March 30, 2017,

fr.

175 million (approximately $175 million) of our 0.000% Swiss franc-denominated notes matured. The notes
and accrued interest to date were paid with net proceeds from the

fr

.350 million Swiss franc-denominated notes issued on March 13, 2017.



On March 13, 2017, we launched an offering of

fr

.350 million of Swiss franc-denominated notes, or
$349 million in U.S. dollars as of March 31, 2017, consisting of:

•

fr

.225 million (or $224 million) of 0.050% fixed rate notes that mature on March 30, 2020

•

fr

.125 million (or $125 million) of 0.617% fixed rate notes that mature on September 30, 2024

On
March 30, 2017, we received net proceeds of

fr.

349 million (or $349 million) that were used for general corporate purposes.

On January 26,
2017,

€

750 million (approximately $801 million) of our 1.125% euro-denominated notes matured. The notes and accrued interest to date were paid with the issuance of commercial paper and cash
on hand.

On December 16, 2016, we redeemed $850 million of 2.250% fixed rate notes, maturing on February 1, 2019, that were issued on
January 16, 2014. The notes were redeemed at a redemption cost equal to $866 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $7 million. In connection with this redemption, during the three months ended December 31, 2016, we
recorded a $19 million loss on debt extinguishment within interest and other expense, net.

On October 31, 2016, we completed a cash tender offer and
retired $3.18 billion of U.S. dollar, euro and British pound sterling-denominated notes. We financed the repurchase of the notes, including the payment of accrued interest and other costs incurred, from net proceeds received on October 28,
2016 from the $3.75 billion note issuance and the term loans described below. In connection with retiring this debt, during the three months ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $409 million loss on debt extinguishment within
interest expense related to the amount we paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized premiums and deferred financing costs in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment. Cash costs related to
tendering the debt are included in long-term debt repayments in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016. We also recognized $1 million in interest income related to the partial settlement of fair value
hedges due to the tender.

On October 19, 2016, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Mondelēz
International, Inc., launched an offering of $3.75 billion of notes, guaranteed by Mondelēz International, Inc. The $1.75 billion of 1.625% notes and the $500 million of floating rate notes will mature on October 28, 2019
and the $1.5 billion of 2.0% notes will mature on October 28, 2021. On October 28, 2016, we received proceeds, net of discounts and associated financing costs, of $3.73 billion. Proceeds from the notes issuance were used for
general corporate purposes, including to grant loans or make distributions to Mondelēz International, Inc. or its subsidiaries to fund the October 2016 cash tender offer and near-term debt maturities. We recorded approximately $20 million
of deferred financing costs and discounts, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes. We entered into cross-currency swaps, serving as cash flow hedges, so that the U.S. dollar-denominated debt payments will
effectively be paid in euros over the life of the debt.

On October 14, 2016, MIHN executed a $1.5 billion bank term loan facility. The loan facility
consists of two $750 million loans, one with a three-year maturity and the other with a five-year maturity. The term loans can be drawn at any time for 60 days after signing. On October 25, 2016, we gave notice of our intent to fully draw
on the loan with a five-year maturity, and funding occurred on October 28, 2016. Proceeds from the $750 million term loan may be used for general corporate purposes, including funding of the tender offer or other debt. On October 25,
2016, we also gave notice of our intent to terminate the $750 million loan with the three-year maturity.

On February 9, 2016, $1,750 million of our
4.125% U.S. dollar notes matured. The notes and accrued interest to date were paid with net proceeds from the

fr

.400 million Swiss franc-denominated notes issued on January 26, 2016 and the

€

700 million euro-denominated notes issued on January 21, 2016, as well as cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper. As we refinanced $1,150 million of the matured notes
with net proceeds from the long-term debt issued in January 2016, we reflected this amount within long-term debt as of December 31, 2015.

On January 26,
2016, we issued

fr

.400 million of Swiss franc-denominated notes, or $399 million in U.S. dollars locked in with a forward currency contract on January 12, 2016, consisting of:

•

fr

.250 million (or $249 million) of 0.080% fixed rate notes that mature on January 26, 2018

•

fr

.150 million (or $150 million) of 0.650% fixed rate notes that mature on July 26, 2022



We received proceeds, net of premiums and deferred financing costs, of $398 million that were used to partially fund
the February 2016 note maturity and for other general corporate purposes. We recorded approximately $1 million of premiums and deferred financing costs, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes.

On January 21, 2016, we issued

€

700 million of euro-denominated 1.625% notes, or $760 million in
U.S. dollars locked in with a forward currency contract on January 13, 2016. The euro-denominated notes will mature on January 20, 2023. We received proceeds, net of discounts and deferred financing costs, of $752 million that were
used to partially fund the February 2016 note maturity and for other general corporate purposes. We recorded approximately $8 million of discounts and deferred financing costs, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the
notes.

Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt was 2.1% as of December 31, 2017, 2.2% as of December 31, 2016 and 3.7% as of
December 31, 2015.

Fair Value of Our Debt:

The fair value of our
short-term borrowings at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 reflects current market interest rates and approximates the amounts we have recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our long-term debt was determined
using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 valuation data) for the publicly traded debt obligations. At December 31, 2017, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $18,354 million and its carrying value was $17,652 million.
At December 31, 2016, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $17,882 million and its carrying value was $17,199 million.

Level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist of exchange-traded commodity futures and listed options. The fair
value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges. Our exchange-traded derivatives are generally subject to master netting arrangements that permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty
when certain criteria are met, such as in the event of default. We also are required to maintain cash margin accounts in connection with funding the settlement of our open positions, and the margin requirements generally fluctuate daily based on
market conditions. We have recorded margin deposits related to our exchange-traded derivatives of $171 million as of December 31, 2017 and $133 million as of December 31, 2016 within other current assets. Based on our net asset or
liability positions with individual counterparties, in the event of default and immediate net settlement of all of our open positions, for derivatives we have in a net asset position, our counterparties would owe us a total of $34 million as of
December 31, 2017 and $48 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we have no Level 1 derivatives in a net liability position, and as of December 31, 2016 we would have owed $2 million for
derivatives in a net liability position.

Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of

over-the-counter

(“OTC”) currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach
based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by
the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the
contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed
by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our commodity and currency exchange OTC derivatives do
not have a legal right of

set-off.

In connection with our OTC derivatives that could be

net-settled

in the event of default, assuming all parties were to fail to comply
with the terms of the agreements, for Level 2 derivatives we have in a net liability position, we would owe $523 million as of December 31, 2017 and $40 million as of December 31, 2016, and for Level 2 derivatives we
have in a net asset position, our counterparties would owe us a total of $26 million as of December 31, 2017 and $162 million as of December 31, 2016. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by
entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.

Cash flow hedge ineffectiveness was not material for all periods presented.

Within interest and other expense, net, we recorded

pre-tax

losses of $97 million in the first quarter of 2016 and
$34 million in the first quarter of 2015 related to amounts excluded from effectiveness testing. These amounts relate to interest rate swaps no longer designated as cash flow hedges due to changes in financing plans. Due to lower overall costs
and our decision to hedge a greater portion of our net investments in operations that use currencies other than the U.S. dollar as their functional currencies, we changed our plans to issue U.S. dollar-denominated debt and instead issued euro and
Swiss franc-denominated notes in 2016 and euro, British pound sterling and Swiss franc-denominated notes in 2015. Amounts excluded from effectiveness testing were not material for all other periods presented.

We record

pre-tax

(i) gains or losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) into earnings,
(ii) gains or losses on ineffectiveness and (iii) gains or losses on amounts excluded from effectiveness testing in:

•

cost of sales for commodity contracts;

•

cost of sales for currency exchange contracts related to forecasted transactions; and

•

interest and other expense, net for interest rate contracts and currency exchange contracts related to intercompany loans.

Based on current market conditions, we would expect to transfer unrealized losses of $1 million (net of taxes) for interest rate cash flow hedges to earnings
during the next 12 months.

Cash Flow Hedge Coverage:

As of
December 31, 2017, our longest dated cash flow hedges are interest rate swaps that hedge forecasted interest rate payments over the next 5 years and 10 months.

In connection with the coffee business transactions, we entered into a number of consecutive euro to U.S. dollar currency exchange
forward contracts in 2015 to lock in an equivalent expected value in U.S. dollars. The

mark-to-market

gains and losses on the derivatives were recorded in earnings. We
recorded net gains of $436 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 within interest and other expense, net in connection with the forward contracts and the transferring of proceeds to our subsidiaries where coffee net assets and shares
were deconsolidated. The currency hedge and related gains and losses were recorded within interest and other expense, net. See Note 2,

The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to the measurement date, was $1,715 million at
December 31, 2017 and $1,540 million at December 31, 2016 for the U.S. pension plans. The accumulated benefit obligation for the

non-U.S.

pension plans was $10,610 million at
December 31, 2017 and $9,531 million at December 31, 2016.

Salaried and

hourly employees
hired after January 1, 2009 in the U.S. and after January 1, 2011 in Canada (or earlier for certain legacy Cadbury employees) are no longer eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plans. These employees are given an enhanced
Company contribution to our employee defined contribution plans. For those salaried and

non-union

hourly employees who are currently participating in the defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and Canada,
benefit accruals will cease December 31, 2019.

The combined U.S. and

non-U.S.

pension plans resulted in a net pension
liability of $1,570 million at December 31, 2017 and $1,882 million at December 31, 2016. We recognized these amounts in our consolidated balance sheets as follows:

Year-end

discount rates for our U.S., Canadian, Eurozone and U.K. plans were developed
from a model portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations.

Year-end

discount rates for our remaining

non-U.S.

plans were developed from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year. We
determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.

At the end of 2015, we changed the approach used to measure service and interest costs for pension benefits. For 2015, we measured service and interest costs utilizing
a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. For 2016, we measured service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash
flows. We believe the new approach provided a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. The impact of this change was a
decrease in net periodic pension cost of approximately $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change did not affect the measurement of our plan obligations. We accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate
and, accordingly, accounted for it on a prospective basis.

Settlement losses include $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 of pension
settlement losses for employees who elected

lump-sum

payments in connection with our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. Retired employees who elected

lump-sum

payments
resulted in net settlement losses of $21 million for our U.S. plans and $6 million for our

non-U.S.

plans in 2017, $15 million for our U.S. plans and $6 million for our

non-U.S.

for more information.

For the U.S. plans, we determine the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost using a calculated
market return value that recognizes the cost over a four year period. For our

non-U.S.

plans, we utilize a similar approach with varying cost recognition periods for some plans, and with others, we determine
the expected return on plan assets based on asset fair values as of the measurement date.

As of December 31, 2017, for the combined U.S. and

non-U.S.

pension plans, we expected to amortize from accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) into net periodic pension cost during 2018:

•

an estimated $209 million of net loss from experience differences; and

•

less than $1 million of estimated prior service credit.

We excluded plan assets of $71 million at December 31, 2017 and $62 million at December 31, 2016 from the above
tables related to certain insurance contracts as they are reported at contract value, in accordance with authoritative guidance.

Fair value measurements:

•

Level 1 – includes primarily U.S and

non-U.S.

equity securities and government bonds valued using quoted prices in active markets.

•

Level 2 – includes primarily pooled funds, including assets in real estate pooled funds, valued using net asset values of participation units held in common collective trusts, as reported by the managers of
the trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. Level 2 plan assets also include corporate bonds and other fixed-income securities, valued using independent observable market inputs, such as matrix
pricing, yield curves and indices.

•

Level 3 – includes investments valued using unobservable inputs that reflect the plans’ assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets, based on the best information available.

•

Fair value estimates for pooled funds are calculated by the investment advisor when reliable quotations or pricing services are not readily available for certain underlying securities. The estimated value is based on
either cost or last sale price for most of the securities valued in this fashion.

•

Fair value estimates for private equity investments are calculated by the general partners using the market approach to estimate the fair value of private investments. The market approach utilizes prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions, type of security, degree of liquidity, restrictions on the disposition, latest round of financing data, company financial statements, relevant valuation multiples and discounted cash flow
analyses.

•

Fair value estimates for private debt placements are calculated using standardized valuation methods, including but not limited to income-based techniques such as discounted cash flow projections or market-based
techniques utilizing public and private transaction multiples as comparables.

•

Fair value estimates for real estate investments are calculated by the investment managers using the present value of future cash flows expected to be received from the investments, based on valuation methodologies such
as appraisals, local market conditions, and current and projected operating performance.

•

Fair value estimates for certain fixed-income securities such as insurance contracts are calculated based on the future stream of benefit payments discounted using prevailing interest rates based on the valuation date.

•

Net asset value – primarily includes equity funds, fixed income funds, real estate funds, hedge funds and private equity investments for which net asset values are normally used.

The increases in Level 3 pension plan investments during 2017 were primarily due to net purchases in corporate bonds and
other fixed income securities, which includes private debt placements, and the effects of currency. The decreases in Level 3 pension plan investments during 2016 were primarily due to net settlements in real estate funds and the effects of
currency.

For our U.S. plans, our investment strategy is to reduce the risk of underfunded plans in part through appropriate asset
allocation within our plan assets. We attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments. The strategy involves using indexed U.S. equity and international
equity securities and actively managed U.S. investment grade fixed-income securities (which constitute 95% or more of fixed-income securities) with smaller allocations to high yield fixed-income securities.



For our

non-U.S.

plans, the investment strategy is subject to local regulations and
the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. In aggregate, the asset allocation targets of our

non-U.S.

plans are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately 32% equity securities
(including investments in real estate), approximately 66% fixed-income securities and approximately 2% for other types of securities. Our investment strategy for our largest

non-U.S.

plan, which comprises 63%
of our

non-U.S.

pension assets, is designed to balance risk and return by diversifying across a wide range of return-seeking and liability matching assets, invested in a range of both active and passive
mandates. We target an allocation of approximately 23% in equity securities, 20% credit, and 57% liability matching assets. The strategy uses indexed global developed equities, actively managed global investment grade and alternative credit, real
estate and other liability matching assets including a

buy-in

annuity policy.

Employer Contributions:

In 2017, we contributed $23 million to our U.S. pension plans and $470 million to our

non-U.S.

pension plans. The

non-U.S.

amount included a

non-recurring

$250 million contribution made in connection with a new funding agreement for a Company plan in the United Kingdom. In addition,
employees contributed $12 million to our

non-U.S.

plans. We make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local funding arrangements and statutory minimum funding requirements. Discretionary
contributions are made to the extent that they are tax deductible and do not generate an excise tax liability.

In 2018, we estimate that our pension contributions
will be $39 million to our U.S. plans and $250 million to our

non-U.S.

plans based on current tax laws. Our actual contributions may be different due to many factors, including changes in tax and
other benefit laws, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates.

Multiemployer Pension Plans:

In
accordance with obligations we have under collective bargaining agreements, we made contributions to multiemployer pension plans of $26 million in 2017, $25 million in 2016 and $31 million in 2015. There are risks of participating in
multiemployer pension plans that are different from single employer plans. Contributions made by a participating employer are not segregated to be used to provide benefits for participants related to that participating employer. If a participating
employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded vested obligations of the plan are borne by the remaining participating employers.

The only individually
significant multiemployer plan we participate in as of December 31, 2017 is the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund (the “Fund”). Our contributions to the Fund exceeded 5% of total contributions to
the Fund for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our contributions to the Fund were $22 million in 2017, $21 million in 2016 and $27 million in 2015. Our contributions to other multiemployer pension plans that were not individually
significant were $4 million in 2017, $4 million in 2016 and $4 million in 2015. Our contributions are based on our contribution rates under our collective bargaining agreements, the number of our eligible employees and Fund
surcharges.

Effective January 1, 2012, the Fund’s zone status changed to “Red”. As a result of this certification, beginning in
July 2012, we were charged a 10% surcharge on our contribution rates. The Fund subsequently adopted a rehabilitation plan on November 7, 2012 that required contribution increases and reductions to benefit provisions. As of August 28, 2016,
the 10% surcharge was no longer applicable and we were required to pay higher contributions under the Fund’s rehabilitation plan. Although our collective bargaining agreements with the Fund expired during 2016 and while we continue to
renegotiate the agreements, we continue to make contributions to the Fund.



Other Costs:

We sponsor and
contribute to employee defined contribution plans. These plans cover eligible salaried,

non-union

and union employees. Our contributions and costs are determined by the matching of employee contributions, as
defined by the plans. Amounts charged to expense in continuing operations for defined contribution plans totaled $43 million in 2017, $44 million in 2016 and $45 million in 2015.

and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe the new approach provided a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the
plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot



rates on the yield curve. The impact of this change was a decrease in net periodic postretirement cost of approximately $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change does
not affect the measurement of our plan obligations. We accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, accounted for it on a prospective basis.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant impact on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A

Note 10. Stock Plans

Under our Amended and Restated 2005 Performance Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), we are authorized through May 21, 2024 to issue a maximum of
243.7 million shares of our Common Stock to employees and

non-employee

directors. As of December 31, 2017, there were 67.2 million shares available to be granted under the Plan.

Stock Options:

Stock options (including stock appreciation rights) are
granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the grant date, generally become exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a maximum term of ten years.

We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes methodology to measure stock option expense at the date
of grant. The fair value of the stock options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period. We recorded compensation expense related to stock options held by our employees of $50 million in 2017, $57 million in 2016
and $50 million in 2015 in our results from continuing operations. The deferred tax benefit recorded related to this compensation expense was $12 million in 2017, $15 million in 2016 and $13 million in 2015. The unamortized
compensation expense related to our employee stock options was $44 million at December 31, 2017 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years.

The risk-free interest rate represents the constant maturity U.S. government treasuries rate with a remaining term equal to the
expected life of the options. The expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. Volatility reflects historical movements in our stock price for a period commensurate with the expected life of the options.
The dividend yield reflects the dividend yield in place at the time of the historical grants.

Deferred Stock Units, Performance Share Units and Restricted
Stock:

Historically we have made grants of deferred stock units, performance share units and restricted stock. Beginning in 2016, we only grant deferred stock
units and performance share units and no longer grant restricted stock. We may grant shares of deferred stock units to eligible employees, giving them, in most instances, all of the rights of shareholders, except that they may not sell, assign,
pledge or otherwise encumber the shares and our deferred stock units do not have voting rights until vested. Shares of deferred stock units are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. Deferred stock units generally vest
on the third anniversary of the grant date. Performance share units granted under our 2005 Plan vest based on varying performance, market and service conditions. The unvested performance share units have no voting rights and do not pay dividends.
Dividend equivalents accumulated over the vesting period are paid only after the performance share units vest.



The fair value of the deferred stock units, performance share units and restricted stock at the date of grant is amortized
to earnings over the vesting period. The fair value of our deferred stock units and restricted stock is measured at the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date. Performance share unit awards generally have targets tied to both performance
and market-based conditions. For market condition components, market volatility and other factors are taken into consideration in determining the grant date fair value and the related compensation expense is recognized regardless of whether the
market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. For performance condition components, we estimate the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved each quarter and adjust compensation expenses
accordingly. The grant date fair value of performance share units is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based total shareholder return component and the market price of our Common Stock on the grant date for
performance-based components. The number of performance share units that ultimately vest ranges from

0-200 percent

of the number granted, based on the achievement of the performance and market-based
components. We recorded compensation expense related to deferred stock units, performance share units and restricted stock of $87 million in 2017, $83 million in 2016 and $86 million in 2015 in our results from continuing operations.
The deferred tax benefit recorded related to this compensation expense was $23 million in 2017, $22 million in 2016 and $24 million in 2015. The unamortized compensation expense related to our deferred stock units, performance share
units and restricted stock was $138 million at December 31, 2017 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.

Share Repurchase
Program:

Between 2013 and 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of a total of $13.7 billion of our Common Stock through December 31,
2018. On January 31, 2018, our Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase program, raising the authorization to $19.7 billion of Common
Stock repurchases, and extended the program through December 31, 2020. Repurchases under the program are determined by management and are wholly discretionary. Prior to January 1, 2017, we had repurchased approximately $10.8 billion
of Common Stock pursuant to this authorization. During 2017, we repurchased approximately 50.6 million shares of Common Stock at an average cost of $43.51 per share, or an aggregate cost of approximately $2.2 billion, all of which was paid
during the period except for approximately $28 million settled in January 2018. All share repurchases were funded through available cash and commercial paper issuances. As of December 31, 2017, we have approximately $0.6 billion in
remaining share repurchase capacity. As of January 31, 2018, subsequent to approximately $0.1 billion of share repurchases in January, our remaining share repurchase capacity was $6.5 billion.



Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings:

We are subject to legal proceedings, claims and
governmental inspections or investigations incidental to our business, including those specified below.

In February 2013 and March 2014, Cadbury India Limited (now
known as Mondelez India Foods Private Limited), a subsidiary of Mondelēz International, and other parties received show cause notices from the Indian Central Excise Authority (the “Excise Authority”) calling upon the parties to
demonstrate why the Excise Authority should not collect a total of 3.7 billion Indian rupees ($59 million as of December 31, 2017) of unpaid excise tax and an equivalent amount of penalties, as well as interest, related to production
at the same Indian facility. We contested these demands for unpaid excise taxes, penalties and interest. On March 27, 2015, after several hearings, the Commissioner of the Excise Authority issued an order denying the excise exemption that we
claimed for the Indian facility and confirming the Excise Authority’s demands for total taxes and penalties in the amount of 5.8 billion Indian rupees ($91 million as of December 31, 2017). We have appealed this order. In
addition, the Excise Authority issued additional show cause notices in February 2015, December 2015 and October 2017 on the same issue but covering the periods January to October 2014, November 2014 to September 2015 and October 2015 to June 2017,
respectively. These notices added a total of 4.9 billion Indian rupees ($77 million as of December 31, 2017) of unpaid excise taxes as well as penalties to be determined up to an amount equivalent to that claimed by the Excise
Authority plus interest. With the implementation of the new Goods and Services Tax in India in July 2017, we will not receive any further show cause notices for additional amounts on this issue. We believe that the decision to claim the excise tax
benefit is valid and we are continuing to contest the show cause notices through the administrative and judicial process.

In April 2013, the staff of the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) advised us and Kraft Foods Group that it was investigating activities related to the trading of December 2011 wheat futures contracts that occurred prior to the

Spin-Off

of Kraft Foods Group. We cooperated with the staff in its investigation. On April 1, 2015, the CFTC filed a complaint against Kraft Foods Group and Mondelēz Global LLC (“Mondelēz
Global”) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (the “CFTC action”). The complaint alleges that Kraft Foods Group and Mondelēz Global (1) manipulated or attempted to manipulate the
wheat markets during the fall of 2011; (2) violated position limit levels for wheat futures and (3) engaged in

non-competitive

trades by trading both sides of

exchange-for-physical

Chicago Board of Trade wheat contracts. The CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties of either triple the monetary gain for each violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act”)
or $1 million for each violation of Section 6(c)(1), 6(c)(3) or 9(a)(2) of the Act and $140,000 for each additional violation of the Act, plus post-judgment interest; an order of permanent injunction prohibiting Kraft Foods Group and
Mondelēz Global from violating specified provisions of the Act; disgorgement of profits; and costs and fees. In December 2015, the court denied Mondelēz Global and Kraft Foods Group’s motion to dismiss the CFTC’s claims of market
manipulation and attempted manipulation, and the parties are now in discovery. Additionally, several class action complaints were filed against Kraft Foods Group and Mondelēz Global in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois by investors in wheat futures and options on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. The complaints make similar allegations as those made in the CFTC action and seek class action certification; an unspecified amount for
damages, interest and unjust enrichment; costs and fees; and injunctive, declaratory and other unspecified relief. In June 2015, these suits were consolidated in the Northern District of Illinois. In June 2016, the court denied Mondelēz Global
and Kraft Foods Group’s motion to dismiss, and the parties are now in discovery. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters; however, based on our Separation and Distribution Agreement with Kraft Foods Group dated as of
September 27, 2012, we expect to bear any monetary penalties or other payments in connection with the CFTC action.

We are a party to various legal proceedings
incidental to our business, including those noted above in this section. At present we believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. However, legal proceedings and government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could involve substantial monetary damages. In addition, in
matters for which conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices or requiring
other remedies. An unfavorable outcome might result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial position.



Third-Party Guarantees:

We
enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2017, we
had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.

Tax Matters:

As part of our 2010 Cadbury acquisition, we became the responsible party for tax matters under a February 2, 2006 dated Deed of Tax Covenant between the Cadbury
Schweppes PLC and related entities (“Schweppes”) and Black Lion Beverages and related entities. The tax matters included an ongoing transfer pricing case with the Spanish tax authorities related to the Schweppes businesses Cadbury divested
prior to our acquisition of Cadbury. During the first quarter of 2017, the Spanish Supreme Court decided the case in our favor. As a result of the final ruling, during the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a favorable earnings impact of
$46 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $12 million in interest and other expense, net, for a total

pre-tax

impact of $58 million due to the

non-cash

reversal of Cadbury-related accrued liabilities related to this matter. In 2017, we recorded additional income of $4 million related to bank guarantee releases within selling, general and
administrative expenses and interest and other expense, net.

During the first quarter of 2017, the Brazilian Supreme Court (the “Court”) ruled against
the Brazilian tax authorities in a leading case related to the computation of certain indirect taxes. The Court ruled that the indirect tax base should not include a value-added tax known as “ICMS”. By removing the ICMS from the tax base,
the Court effectively eliminated a “tax on a tax.” Our Brazilian subsidiary had received an injunction against making payments for the “tax on a tax” in 2008 and since that time until December 2016, had accrued this portion of
the tax each quarter in the event that the tax was reaffirmed by the Brazilian courts. On September 30, 2017, based on legal advice and the publication of the Court’s decision related to this case, we determined that the likelihood that
the increased tax base would be reinstated and assessed against us was remote. Accordingly, we reversed our accrual of 667 million Brazilian reais, or $212 million as of September 30, 2017, of which, $153 million was recorded
within selling, general and administrative expenses and $59 million was recorded within interest and other expense, net. The Brazilian tax authority is seeking potential clarification or adjustment of the terms of enforcement with the
Court. We continue to monitor developments in this matter and currently do not expect a material future impact on our financial statements.

Leases:

Rental expenses recorded in continuing operations were $284 million in 2017, $317 million in 2016 and $331 million in 2015. As of
December 31, 2017, minimum rental commitments under

Note 14. Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, new U.S. tax reform legislation was enacted that included a broad range of complex provisions impacting the taxation of businesses. Certain
impacts of the new legislation would generally require accounting to be completed in the period of enactment, however in response to the complexities of this new legislation, the SEC issued guidance to provide companies with relief. Specifically,
when the initial accounting for items under the new legislation is incomplete, the guidance allows us to recognize provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made or to continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate of the
impact cannot be made. The SEC has provided up to a

one-year

window for companies to finalize the accounting for the impacts of this new legislation and we anticipate finalizing our accounting during 2018.

While our accounting for the new U.S. tax legislation is not complete, we have made reasonable estimates for some provisions and recognized a $59 million
discrete net tax benefit in our 2017 financial statements. This net benefit is primarily comprised of a $1,311 million provisional deferred tax benefit from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax
rate as well as an additional $61 million provisional deferred tax benefit related to changes in our indefinite reinvestment assertion, partially offset by a $1,317 million provisional charge for the estimated transition tax.

In general, the transition tax is as a result of the deemed repatriation imposed by the new legislation that results in the taxation of our accumulated foreign earnings
and profits (“E&P”) at a 15.5% rate on liquid assets (i.e. cash and other specified assets) and 8% on the remaining unremitted foreign E&P, both net of foreign tax credits. At this time, we have not yet gathered, prepared and
analyzed the necessary information in sufficient detail to complete the complex calculations necessary to finalize the amount of our transition tax. We believe that our provisional calculations result in a reasonable estimate of the transition tax
and related foreign tax credit, and as such have included those amounts in our

year-end

income tax provision. We do not believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the estimated
excess foreign tax credit carryforward created by the deemed repatriation and have thus recognized a full valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset. As we complete the analysis of accumulated foreign E&P and related foreign taxes paid
on an entity by entity basis and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets, we will update our provisional estimate of the transition tax and related foreign tax credit, including any excess credit carryforward and the
corresponding valuation allowance.

Our estimate of the deferred tax benefit due to the revaluation of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities is also a provisional
amount under the SEC’s guidance. Due to the newly enacted U.S. tax rate change, timing differences that are estimated balances as of the date of enactment and

year-end

will result in changes to our
estimate of the deferred rate change when those estimates are finalized with the filing of the 2017 income tax return. This is a result of the different federal income tax rates in effect for 2017 (35%) and 2018 (21%). Since many of the

year-end

deferred tax balances include estimates of events that have not yet occurred such as payments expected to be made during 2018 but which are deductible on the 2017 tax return, these amounts cannot yet be
known to finalize the impact of the tax rate change.

As a result of U.S. tax reform, we have changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion for most companies owned
directly by our U.S. subsidiaries, and as such, we may need to accrue deferred taxes. As of year end, we have calculated the impact to accrue the deferred tax assets related to two entities where the deferred tax benefits are now expected to be
realized in the foreseeable future. However, we do not have the necessary information gathered, prepared and analyzed to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of any remaining outside basis differences inherent in the rest of our foreign
subsidiaries. We will gather the information necessary and compute the outside basis differences for those subsidiaries where we are no longer indefinitely reinvested and record any new deferred taxes as reasonable estimates are available. We
estimate that the unremitted earnings as of December 31, 2017 in those subsidiaries where we expect to continue to be indefinitely reinvested is approximately $2 billion. It is impracticable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred
tax liabilities on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. Future tax law changes or changes in the needs of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could require us to recognize deferred tax liabilities on a portion, or all, of our accumulated earnings that were
previously expected to be indefinitely reinvested.



The legislation also establishes new provisions that will affect our 2018 results, including but not limited to, a
reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate on domestic operations; the creation of a new minimum tax called the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT); a new provision that taxes U.S. allocated expenses (e.g. interest and general administrative expenses)
as well as currently taxes certain income from foreign operations (Global Intangible

Low-Tax

Income, or “GILTI”); a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign
subsidiaries; a new limitation on deductible interest expense; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and limitations on the deductibility of certain employee compensation.

While the new legislation generally eliminates U.S. federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries going forward, certain income earned by certain
subsidiaries must be included currently in our U.S. taxable income under the new GILTI inclusion rules (as a result of U.S. expense allocation rules). Because of the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision
of the legislation and the application of U.S. GAAP. Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to make an accounting policy election and either treat taxes due from GILTI as a current-period expense when they are incurred or factor such amounts into our
measurement of deferred taxes. Our selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new GILTI rules will depend in part on analyzing our global income to determine whether we expect to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to
GILTI, and if so, what the impact is expected to be. We have not yet computed a reasonable estimate of the effect of this provision, and therefore, we have not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes related to GILTI nor
have we made any adjustments related to GILTI tax in our

year-end

financial statements.

Our 2017 effective tax rate of 22.0% was favorably impacted by the mix of

pre-tax

income
in various

non-U.S.

tax jurisdictions and net tax benefits from $117 million of discrete

one-time

events, partially offset by an increase in domestic earnings as
compared to the prior year. The discrete net tax benefits included the provisional net impact from U.S. tax reform discussed previously, favorable audit settlements and statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions, and the net reduction of our
French and Belgian deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2017 that reduced the corporate income tax rates in each country, partially offset by the addition of a valuation allowance in one of our Chinese entities.

Our 2016 effective tax rate of 8.9% was favorably impacted by the mix of

pre-tax

income in various

non-U.S.

tax jurisdictions and net tax benefits from $161 million of discrete

one-time

events. The discrete net tax benefits related to favorable audit settlements and
statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and the net reduction of our U.K. and French deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2016 that reduced the corporate income tax rates in each country.

Our 2015 effective tax rate of 7.5% was favorably impacted by the

one-time

third quarter sale of our coffee business that
resulted in a

pre-tax

gain of $6,809 million and $184 million of related tax expense, as well as $27 million of tax costs incurred to remit proceeds up from lower-tier foreign subsidiaries to
allow cash to be redeployed within our retained foreign operations. The benefit of the third quarter transaction was partially offset by the tax costs associated with the sale of our interest in AGF in the first half of the year and the impact of
deconsolidating our Venezuelan operations on December 31, 2015. Excluding the impacts of these transactions, our effective tax rate would have been 17.8%, reflecting favorable impacts from the mix of

pre-tax

income in various

non-U.S.

tax jurisdictions and net tax benefits from $119 million of discrete

one-time

events. The
remaining discrete

one-time

events primarily related to favorable tax audit settlements and expirations of statutes of limitations in several jurisdictions and the net reduction of U.K. deferred tax
liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2015 that reduced the U.K. corporate income tax rate.

Our significant valuation allowances are in the U.S., Mexico, China and Ireland. The U.S. valuation allowance relates to excess
foreign tax credits generated by the deemed repatriation under U.S. tax reform. The valuation allowance in China results from a change in judgment as to the realizability of one of our Chinese entity’s deferred tax assets. The Mexico and
Ireland valuation allowances relate to loss carryforwards where we do not currently expect to generate gains of the proper character to utilize the carryforwards in the future.

At December 31, 2017, the Company has

pre-tax

loss carryforwards of $4,060 million, of which $1,105 million will
expire at various dates between 2018 and 2037 and the remaining $2,955 million can be carried forward indefinitely.

As of January 1, 2017, our unrecognized tax benefits were $610 million. If we had recognized all of these
benefits, the net impact on our income tax provision would have been $549 million. Our unrecognized tax benefits were $579 million at December 31, 2017, and if we had recognized all of these benefits, the net impact on our income tax
provision would have been $524 million. Within the next 12 months, our unrecognized tax benefits could increase by approximately $40 million due to unfavorable audit developments or decrease by approximately $150 million due to audit
settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. We include accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. We had accrued interest and penalties of $189 million as of
January 1, 2017 and $212 million as of December 31, 2017. Our 2017 provision for income taxes included $26 million for interest and penalties.

Our income tax filings are regularly examined by federal, state and

non-U.S.

tax authorities. Our 2013-2015 U.S. federal income
tax filings are currently under examination by the IRS. U.S. state and

non-U.S.

jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from three to five years; however, these statutes are often extended
by mutual agreement with the tax authorities. Years still open to examination by

non-U.S.

tax authorities in major jurisdictions include (earliest open tax year in parentheses): Brazil (2012), China (2007),
France (2014), India (2005), Italy (2012) and the United Kingdom (2015).

Note 16. Segment Reporting

We manufacture and market primarily snack food
products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy and various cheese & grocery products, as well as powdered beverage products. We manage our global business and report operating results
through geographic units.

Our operations and management structure are organized into four reportable operating segments:

•

Latin America

•

AMEA

•

Europe

•

North America



On October 1, 2016, we integrated our EEMEA operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments to
further leverage and optimize the operating scale built within the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined within our Europe operating segment, while the remaining Middle East and
African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific region to form the AMEA operating segment. We have reflected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented.

We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth
opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments were part of our base business. Beginning in the
third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for our new coffee equity method investment in JDE, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in equity method investment earnings outside of segment operating income. For
the six months ended December 31, 2015,

after-tax

equity method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis. Earnings from equity method investments through July 2,
2015 recorded within segment operating income were $52 million in AMEA and $4 million in North America. See Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Principles of Consolidation,

and Note 2,

Divestitures and
Acquisitions

,

for additional information.

In 2015, we also began to report stock-based compensation for our corporate employees within general corporate
expenses that were reported within our North America region. We reclassified $32 million of corporate stock-based compensation expense in 2015 from the North America segment to general corporate expenses.

We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze
segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative
expenses), amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on divestitures, loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude
these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, we do not present these items by segment because they
are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews.

Our segment net revenues and earnings, reflecting our current segment structure for
all periods presented, were:

Item 9A. Controls and
Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We
have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and
CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2017.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and
CFO, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

•

provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. Management based this assessment on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).

Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2017, based on the
criteria in

Internal Control Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, as stated in their report that appears under Item 8.

February 9, 2018



Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, due to the malware incident, we continued to add supplemental information technology and internal controls over financial reporting. Additionally, we continued to work with outsourced partners to further simplify
and standardize processes and focus on scalable, transactional processes across all regions. We continued to transition some of our transactional data processing as well as financial and employee services for a number of countries across Europe and
AMEA to three outsourced partners and/or internal service centers. Pursuant to our service agreements, the controls previously established around these accounting functions will be maintained by our outsourced partners or by us, and they are subject
to management’s internal control testing. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B. Other Information.

None.
