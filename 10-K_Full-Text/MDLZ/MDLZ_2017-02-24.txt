PART I

Item 1. Business.

General

We are one of the world’s largest snack companies with global net revenues of $25.9 billion and net earnings of $1.7 billion in 2016. We manufacture and
market delicious snack food and beverage products for consumers in approximately 165 countries around the world. Our portfolio includes many iconic snack brands including

Nabisco

,

Oreo, LU

and

belVita

biscuits

; Cadbury,
Milka, Cadbury Dairy Milk

and

Toblerone

chocolate;

Trident

gum;

Halls

candy and

Tang

powdered beverages.

We are proud members of
the Standard and Poor’s 500, NASDAQ 100 and Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Our Common Stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “MDLZ.” We have been incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia since 2000.



Strategy

We intend to leverage
our core strengths, including our advantaged geographic footprint, market leadership positions and portfolio of iconic brands and innovation platforms, to achieve three primary goals of growing our people, growing our business and growing our
impact.

•

Grow our People:

We hire and inspire our people to engage in challenging and rewarding career experiences and to contribute their talent to create a great place to work. We collaborate globally, scale ideas
quickly and develop world-class capabilities. Our culture is fast-moving, bold, innovative and accountable, reflecting the traits and skills necessary to thrive in a competitive global marketplace. To support and build on the success of our people
in a continually-evolving business environment, we invest in our people and their development, foster respect for one another, celebrate diversity and commit to authenticity at every level. We also work to create an environment in which our people
can demonstrate innovative and courageous leadership to make a difference in every role they play in the Company. As reflected in our actions and our investments in our people, we value their contributions and are committed to their success.

•

Grow our Business:

We aim to deliver strong, profitable long-term growth by accelerating our core snacks business and expanding the reach of our Power Brands globally. Leveraging our Power brands –
including

Oreo, LU

and

belVita

biscuits;

Milka, Cadbury Dairy Milk

and

Toblerone

chocolate;

Trident

gum and

Halls

candy – and our innovation platforms, we plan to innovate boldly and connect with our
consumers wherever they are, including new markets around the world, using both traditional and digital channels. As consumer consumption patterns change to more accessible, frequent and better-for-you snacking, we are enhancing the goodness of many
of our brands (including providing simpler and wholesome ingredient-focused snacks), expanding the well-being offerings in our portfolio and inspiring consumers to snack mindfully by providing clear and simple nutrition information. As shopping
expands further online, we are also working to grow our e-commerce platform and on-line presence with consumers. To fuel these investments, we have been working to optimize our cost structure. These efforts include reinventing our supply chain,
including adding and upgrading to more efficient production lines, while reducing the complexity of our product offerings, ingredients and number of suppliers. We also continue to aggressively manage our overhead costs. We have embraced and embedded
zero-based budgeting practices across the organization to identify potential areas of cost reductions and capture and sustain savings within our ongoing operating budgets. Through these actions, we’re leveraging our brands, platforms and
capabilities to drive long-term value and return on investment for our shareholders.

•

Grow our Impact:

Our growth is linked to enhancing the well-being of the people who make and enjoy our products, the communities we serve and the planet and its limited resources. As consumers seek foods that
taste delicious and match their lifestyle goals, we are committed to meeting their well-being needs by becoming a leader in tasty, accessible, well-being snacks. To ensure the safety of our people, we have implemented world-class safety programs,
workplace wellness programs and policies to promote fair and equal treatment. We conduct business in compliance with the law, our company policies and accepted standards of business conduct. We also seek to improve consumers’ well-being by
providing innovative community programs focused on learning about food choices, preparing healthy meals, growing nutritious foods and encouraging children to play. We encourage our people to contribute time and talent to community programs, and we
provide humanitarian aid to communities in times of need. We also leverage our global operating scale to secure sustainable raw materials and work with suppliers to drive meaningful social and environmental changes.

Reportable Segments

Our operations and management structure are organized
into four reportable operating segments:

•

Latin America

•

Asia, Middle East, and Africa (“AMEA”)

•

Europe

•

North America

On October 1, 2016, we integrated our Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EEMEA”)
operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments to further leverage and optimize the operating scale built within the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined
within our Europe region, while the remaining Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific region to form the AMEA operating segment. We have reflected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented.



We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business
environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.

We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze
segment performance and trends. For a definition and reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated pre-tax earnings as well as other information on our segments, see Note 16,

Significant Divestitures and Acquisitions

For information on our
significant divestitures and acquisitions, please refer to Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions,

and specifically, in connection with our global coffee business deconsolidation, see the discussions under

JDE Coffee Business
Transactions

and

Keurig Transaction

.

Customers

No single
customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2016. Our five largest customers accounted for 16.6% and our ten largest customers accounted for 22.9% of net revenues from continuing operations in 2016.

Seasonality

Demand for our products is generally balanced over the first
three quarters of the year and increases in the fourth quarter primarily because of holidays and other seasonal events. Depending on when Easter falls, there may also be a shift between the first and second quarter results. We build inventory based
on expected demand and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt so the backlog of unfilled orders is not material. Funding for working capital items, including inventory and receivables, is normally sourced from operating cash
flows and short-term commercial paper borrowings. For additional information on our liquidity, working capital management, cash flow and financing activities, see

Liquidity and Capital Resources

, Note 1

, Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies,

and Note 7,

Debt and Borrowing Arrangements

, appearing later in this 10-K filing.

Competition

We face competition in all aspects of our business. Competitors include large multi-national as well as numerous local and regional companies. Some competitors have
different profit objectives and investment time horizons than we do and therefore approach pricing and promotional decisions differently. We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, service, product innovation, taste,
convenience, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, effectiveness of sales and marketing, routes to market and distribution networks, promotional activity and price. Improving our market position or introducing a new product
requires substantial research, development, advertising and promotional expenditures. We believe these investments lead to better products for the consumer and support our growth and market position.

Distribution and Marketing

Across our segments, we generally sell our
products to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, convenience stores, gasoline stations, drug stores, value stores and other retail food outlets. We distribute our products through direct store
delivery, company-owned and satellite warehouses, distribution centers and other facilities. We use the services of independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations.

We also sell our products on a growing number of e-commerce platforms as consumer consumption patterns change (reflecting greater consumer time compression and
technology use) and retail increasingly expands online. Within our digital and social marketing, we create opportunities for consumers to easily find and buy our products online. We have built relationships with several retailers to develop
customized programs that fit their and our formats and provide consumers additional personalized offerings from our snacks portfolio.



We conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities: (i) consumer marketing and advertising
including on-air, print, outdoor, digital and social media and other product promotions; (ii) consumer sales incentives such as coupons and rebates; and (iii) trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of
our products by our customers.

Raw Materials and Packaging

We purchase
and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, dairy, wheat, corn products, palm and other vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners and nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our
products and natural gas, fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses. We monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production.

A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other
programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control.
We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in
specific raw material costs.

While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials
we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources. For additional information on our commodity costs, refer to the

Commodity Trends

section within

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations

.

Intellectual Property

Our intellectual
property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, technology and know-how) are material to our business.

We own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their
registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to
processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent
protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability
of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business.

From time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third party
products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft Foods Group,” which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party
various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spin-off of our North American grocery business.

Research and Development

We pursue four objectives in research and
development: product safety and quality, growth through new products, superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs. Our innovation efforts focus on anticipating consumer demands and adapting quickly to changing market trends. Wellness products
and healthy snacking are a significant focus of our current research and development initiatives. These initiatives aim to accelerate our growth and margins by addressing consumer needs and market trends and leveraging our global innovation
platforms, Power Brands and breakthrough technologies. In September 2016, we announced our plan to invest $65 million over 2017-2018 to build out and modernize our network of global research and development facilities. We are focusing our technical
resources at nine large locations to drive global growth and innovation. These global hubs will enable greater effectiveness, improved efficiency and accelerated project delivery. These locations are in Curitiba, Brazil; Suzhou, China; Thane, India;
Mexico City, Mexico; East Hanover, New Jersey; Wroclaw, Poland; Jurong, Singapore; Bournville, United Kingdom and Reading, United Kingdom.



At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,550 scientists and engineers, of which approximately 1,950 are primarily
focused on research and development and the remainder are primarily focused on quality assurance and regulatory affairs. Our research and development expense was $376 million in 2016, $409 million in 2015 and $455 million in 2014. Our total research
and development expense was lower in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to the deconsolidation of our global coffee business in July 2015, currency and cost optimization initiatives.

Regulation

Our food products and ingredients are subject to local, national
and multi-national regulations related to labeling, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and
facilities, enforcing standards for selected food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government
agricultural policy and intervention, and the scrutiny of human rights issues in industry supply chains has led to developing regulation in many countries. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic
governmental and administrative review.

Examples of laws and regulations that affect our business include selective food taxes, labeling requirements such as
nutrient profiling, marketing restrictions, potential withdrawal of trade concessions as dispute settlement retaliation and sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials. We will continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations. At this
time, we do not expect the cost of complying with new laws and regulations will be material. Also refer to Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting

, for additional
information on government regulations and currency-related impacts on our operations in the United Kingdom, Argentina and other countries.

Environmental
Regulation

Throughout the countries in which we do business, we are subject to local, national and multi-national environmental laws and regulations relating
to the protection of the environment. We have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements. In the United States, the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Based on information currently available, we believe that our compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a
material effect on our financial results.

Sustainability

A key
strategic goal for us is to

Grow our Impact,

and we seek to do that in part by sourcing our products sustainably, reducing the environmental impact of our operations and packaging, and being mindful of the limited resources available around
the world. We continue to leverage our global operating scale to secure sustainable raw materials and work with suppliers to drive meaningful social and environmental changes, focusing on where we can make the most impact. For example, we have
taken direct accountability for building a sustainable cocoa supply with our $400 million Cocoa Life program. And we’re improving sustainability in our wheat supply by working with farmers in North America and through our Harmony program in
Europe.

Our 2020 sustainability goals aim to place us at the forefront in the fight against climate change with ambitious targets for an end-to-end approach to
reduce our carbon footprint, including reducing our absolute CO


emissions from manufacturing and addressing deforestation in key raw material supply chains. We are also working to cut our
absolute water footprint in manufacturing, focusing on priority sites where water is most scarce, and we are working to reduce waste in manufacturing and packaging.

We have been recognized for our ongoing economic, environmental and social contributions and this year were listed again on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index
(“DJSI”) – World and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry. We
improved our overall score to reach the 95

th

percentile of our industry and achieved perfect scores in health and nutrition, raw material sourcing and water-related risks.



We also participate in the CDP Climate and Water disclosures and continue to work to reduce our carbon and water
footprints. We ranked 4

th

in the Access to Nutrition Index, a global index that assesses and ranks the world’s largest food and beverage companies on their nutrition-related commitments,
practices and performance. We are committed to continue this and other related work in the areas of sustainable resources and agriculture, mindful snacking, community partnerships and safety of our products and people.

Employees

We employed through our consolidated subsidiaries approximately
90,000 people worldwide at December 31, 2016 and approximately 99,000 at December 31, 2015. Employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 65% of our 78,000 employees outside the United States and
approximately 28% of our 12,000 U.S. employees. Our business units are subject to various local, national and multi-national laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. In accordance with European Union requirements,
we also have established a European Workers Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We or our subsidiaries are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and we work to renegotiate these collective bargaining
agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire.

International Operations

Based on where we sell our products, we generated 75.6% of our 2016 net revenues, 78.7% of our 2015 net revenues and 82.1% of our 2014 net revenues from continuing
operations outside the United States. We sell our products to consumers in approximately 165 countries. At December 31, 2016, we had operations in more than 80 countries and made our products at 150 manufacturing and processing facilities in 52
countries. Refer to Note 16,

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.

You should read the following risk factors carefully when evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe we have identified and discussed
below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may adversely affect our business, performance or financial
condition in the future.

We operate in a highly competitive industry.

The food and snacking industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors include major international food, snack and beverage companies that, like us, operate in
multiple geographic areas as well as numerous local and regional companies. We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, service, product innovation, taste, convenience, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer
preferences, effectiveness of sales and marketing, routes to market and distribution networks, promotional activity and price. If we do not effectively respond to challenges from our competitors, our business could be adversely affected.

Competitor and customer pressures may require that we reduce our prices. These pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and
other cost increases. Failure to effectively assess, timely change and set proper pricing or trade incentives may negatively impact the achievement of our strategic and financial goals. The rapid emergence of new distribution channels, such as
e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. We may need to increase or reallocate spending
on marketing, advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase market share. These expenditures might not result in trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we reduce prices or our costs increase but we cannot increase sales
volumes to offset those changes, then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer.

In addition, companies in our industry are under increasing
pressure to improve the efficiency of their overall cost structures. We are pursuing a transformation agenda with the goals of focusing our portfolio, improving our cost structure and operating model, and accelerating our growth. If we do not
achieve these objectives or do not implement transformation in a way that minimizes disruptions to our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.



Maintaining, extending and expanding our reputation and brand image is essential to our business success.

Our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products, extend our brands into new geographies and to new distribution platforms,
including e-commerce, and expand our brand image with new and renewed product offerings.

We seek to maintain, extend and expand our brand image through marketing
investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, and both product renovation and innovation. Failure to effectively address the continuing global focus on well-being, including weight management, changing consumer perceptions of certain
ingredients, and increasing attention from the media, shareholders, consumers, activists and other stakeholders on the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image. Undue caution on our part in addressing these challenges could
weaken our competitive position. Such pressures could also lead to stricter regulations and increased focus on food and snacking marketing practices. Increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising, consumer promotions and marketing,
or our response to those restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend and expand our brands. Moreover, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, product quality and safety, where we manufacture our products or
environmental and human and workplace rights risks in our supply chain could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or
these matters are immaterial to our operations. Our sponsorship relationships could also subject us to negative publicity.

In addition, our success in maintaining,
extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns. A
variety of legal and regulatory restrictions limit how and to whom we market our products. These restrictions may limit our ability to maintain, extend and expand our brand image, particularly as social media and the communications environment
continue to evolve. Negative posts or comments about us on social networking web sites (whether factual or not) or security breaches related to use of our social media and failure to respond effectively to these posts, comments or activities could
seriously damage our reputation and brand image across the various regions in which we operate. In addition, we might fail to invest sufficiently in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image, and our marketing efforts might not achieve
desired results. As a result, we might be required to recognize impairment charges on our intangible assets or goodwill. Furthermore, third parties may sell counterfeit or spurious versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks. If
that happens, consumers could confuse these counterfeit products for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand, causing consumers to refrain from purchasing our brands. If we do not successfully maintain, extend and expand our
reputation and brand image, then our brands, product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We are
subject to risks from operating globally.

We are a global company and generated 75.6% of our 2016 net revenues, 78.7% of our 2015 net revenues and 82.1% of our
2014 net revenues outside the United States. We manufacture and market our products in approximately 165 countries and have operations in more than 80 countries. Therefore, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations. Those risks include:

•

compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”);

•

compliance with antitrust and competition laws, trade laws, data privacy laws, anti-bribery laws, and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple regimes;

•

changes in tax laws, including enactment of new U.S. and foreign jurisdiction tax laws, interpretation of tax laws and tax audit outcomes;

•

currency devaluations or fluctuations in currency values, including in developing markets such as Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Nigeria, Ukraine and South Africa as well as in developed
markets such as the United Kingdom and other countries within the European Union;

•

the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities like cocoa, potential changes in U.S. trade programs and trade relations with other countries,
or regulations, taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales;

•

changes in capital controls, including currency exchange controls, government currency policies such as demonetization in India or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product into various
countries or repatriate cash from outside the United States;

•

increased sovereign risk, such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit ratings of governments, particularly in our Latin America and AMEA regions;



•

changes in local regulations and laws, the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other
resources;

•

varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights;

•

discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies;

•

greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; and

•

design, implementation and use of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base.

In addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public
corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. High unemployment or the slowdown in economic growth in some markets could constrain consumer
spending. As a branded food company that seeks to sell our products at a premium, declining consumer purchasing power could result in loss of market share and adversely impact our profitability. Continued instability in the banking and governmental
sectors of certain countries or the dynamics and uncertainties associated with the United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union (“Brexit”), including currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility in global stock markets,
could have a negative effect on our business. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, results of operations, and our relationships
with customers, suppliers and employees in the short or long term.

Our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political, economic and regulatory
risks.

Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets, including among others Brazil, China, India, Mexico,
Russia, Argentina, Ukraine, the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. However, some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established
markets. In many countries, particularly those with emerging economies, engaging in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, or local anti-bribery laws may be more
common. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials, including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business.
Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their
production capacities. Our success in emerging markets is critical to achieving our growth strategy. If we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political, economic and regulatory risks, our product
sales, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, such as occurred when we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our Venezuelan operations at the close of 2015 or any potential impact on our
business in Venezuela from future economic or political developments.

Unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our
products to our customers.

We manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale. We have a complex network of suppliers and material needs, owned
manufacturing locations, co-manufacturing locations, distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently. Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, like weather,
natural disasters, supply and commodity shortages, fire, explosions, terrorism, political unrest, generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or co-manufacturers’ operations. If we
do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations, for example, by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations, or cannot quickly repair damage to our information, production or supply
systems, we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers and the quality and safety of our products might be negatively affected. If that occurs, we may lose our customers’ confidence or suffer damage to our
reputation, and long-term consumer demand for our products could decline. In addition, we might not have the functions, processes or organizational capability necessary to achieve on our anticipated timeframes our strategic ambition to reconfigure
our supply chain and drive efficiencies to fuel growth. Further, our ability to supply multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint may be negatively impacted by portfolio complexity, changes in volume produced and changes to
regulatory restrictions or labor-related constraints on our ability to adjust production capacity in the markets in which we operate. These events could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of
operations.



We are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations.

At December 31, 2016, we sold our products in approximately 165 countries and had operations in more than 80 countries. Consequently, a significant portion of our
business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses must be translated
into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes or converted into U.S. dollars to service obligations such as our U.S. dollar-denominated indebtedness and to pay dividends to our shareholders. In addition, movements in currency exchange rates can affect
transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries. We seek to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily on cross-currency transactions, but our efforts may not be successful. Accordingly, changes in
the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes or for transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.

Commodity and other input prices are volatile and may increase or decrease significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained.

We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, dairy, wheat, corn products, palm and other vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners,
and nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses. Prices for these raw materials, other supplies and energy are
volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict. These conditions include global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, political conditions, severe weather, the potential longer-term consequences of climate
change on agricultural productivity, crop disease or pests, water risk, health pandemics, consumer or industrial demand, and changes in governmental trade, alternative energy and agricultural programs. Increasing focus on climate change,
deforestation, water, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system may lead to increased activism focusing on consumer goods companies, government intervention and consumer response, and could
adversely affect our or our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. Many of the commodities we purchase are grown by smallholder farmers, who might lack the capacity to invest
to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions. Although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases, we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs, and our hedging strategies may not
protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase or decrease the costs of our products, and our profitability could suffer as a result.
Moreover, increases in the price of our products, including increases to cover higher input costs, may result in lower sales volumes, while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues, profits or
margins. Likewise, constraints in the supply of key commodities may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings. If our mitigation activities are not effective, if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our
prices, or if we are limited by supply constraints, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Complying with
changes in and inconsistencies among laws and regulations in many countries in which we operate could increase our costs.

Our activities throughout the world
are highly regulated and subject to government oversight. Various laws and regulations govern food production, storage, distribution, sales, advertising, labeling and marketing, as well as licensing, trade, labor, tax and environmental matters, and
health and safety practices. Government authorities regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations. Our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations could
materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations. For instance, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected by the regulatory and economic impact of changes in
taxation and trade relations among the United States and other countries or changes in the European Union such as Brexit.

We may be unable to hire or retain and
develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or manage changes in our workforce.

We must hire, retain and develop effective leaders
and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce. We compete to hire new personnel in the many countries in which we manufacture and market our products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies. Unplanned turnover or failure to
develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or to hire and retain a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our
competitiveness.



We also face increased personnel-related risks in connection with implementing the changes in our transformation agenda
related to our operating model and business processes, including building a global shared services capability and reconfiguring our supply chain. These risks could lead to operational challenges, including increased competition for employees with
the skills we require to achieve our business goals; higher employee turnover, including of employees with key capabilities; and challenges in developing the capabilities necessary to build and effectively execute a shared services function and
transform our business processes. Furthermore, we might be unable to manage appropriately changes in, or that affect, our workforce or satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees. This includes our
management of employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils, who represent approximately 65% of our 78,000 employees outside the United States and approximately 28% of our 12,000 U.S. employees. Strikes, work stoppages or other
forms of labor unrest by our employees or those of our suppliers or distributors, or situations like the re-negotiation of collective bargaining agreements covering eight U.S. facilities that expired in February 2016, could cause disruptions to our
supply chain, manufacturing or distribution processes.

These risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation, ability to meet the needs of our
customers, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Our retail customers are consolidating and we must leverage our value proposition in
order to compete against retailer and other economy brands.

Retail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors in the European
Union, the United States and our other major markets continue to consolidate or form buying alliances, resulting in fewer, larger customers with whom we can conduct business. Large retail customers and customer alliances can resist our efforts to
increase prices, delist our products or reduce the shelf space allotted to our products, and demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs, longer payment terms or specifically tailored products. Retail customers might also adopt these
tactics in their dealings with us in response to the significant growth in online retailing for consumer products, which is outpacing the growth of traditional retail channels. In addition, larger retail customers have the scale to develop supply
chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products. Our products must provide higher quality or value to our consumers than the less
expensive alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Consumers may not buy our products if consumers perceive the difference in the quality or value between our products and the retailer or other economy brands has narrowed.
If consumers switch to purchasing or otherwise prefer the retailer or other economy brands, then we could lose market share or sales volumes, or we may need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings.

Retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material
adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases.

If we do not effectively respond to retail consolidation, increasing retail power and competition from retailer and other economy brands, our reputation, brands,
product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We are subject to changes in our relationships with
significant customers or suppliers.

During 2016, our five largest customers accounted for 16.6% of our net revenues. There can be no assurance that our
customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands. The loss of or
disruptions related to significant customers could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer. This could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and
results of operations.

Additionally, disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes related to pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability
to supply products to our customers or operate our business and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.



We may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims.

We could decide, or laws or regulations could require us, to recall products due to suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination,
spoilage or other adulteration, product mislabeling or product tampering. In addition, if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall
consumption of products in this category. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation, brands, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We may also suffer losses if our products or operations or those of our suppliers violate applicable laws or regulations, or if our or our suppliers’ products
cause injury, illness or death. In addition, our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism. A significant product liability or other legal judgment against us, a related regulatory enforcement action, a
widespread product recall or attempts to manipulate us based on threats related to the safety of our products could materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability. Moreover, even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other
claim is unsuccessful, has no merit or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation, brands, product sales, financial condition and results of
operations.

We could be subject to legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions.

We are a large snack food company operating in highly regulated environments and constantly evolving legal, tax and regulatory frameworks around the world.
Consequently, we are subject to greater risk of litigation, legal or tax claims, or other regulatory enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate policies and procedures we have
implemented to promote compliance with existing laws and regulations. Moreover, our failure to maintain effective control environment processes, including in connection with the development of our global shared services capability, could lead to
violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. Litigation, legal or tax claims, or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or controls could subject
us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We
may not successfully identify, complete or manage strategic transactions.

We regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including
acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives. We may not successfully identify, complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic
transactions. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable transactions; negotiate favorable contractual terms; comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents, clearances and approvals (including regulatory
and antitrust clearances and approvals); integrate or separate businesses; realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions; effectively implement control environment processes with employees
joining us as a result of a transaction; minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; achieve accurate estimates of fair value; minimize potential loss of customers or key employees; and minimize
indemnities and potential disputes with buyers, sellers and strategic partners. In addition, execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial,
managerial and operational risks.

With respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular, we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to
conform standards, controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with
the integration of operations; and coordinate antitrust and competition laws in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions. Joint ventures and similar strategic alliances pose additional risks, as we share ownership and management
responsibilities with one or more other parties who may not have the same objectives, priorities, strategies or resources as we do. Strategic alliances we have entered into include combining our wholly owned coffee businesses with those of D.E
Master Blenders 1753 B.V. (“DEMB”) to create a new company, Jacobs Douwe Egberts (“JDE”), in July 2015 and exchanging a portion of our equity ownership in JDE for equity in the new holding company of Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.
(“Keurig”) in March 2016. Transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and non-financial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits. Depending on the nature of the business ventures,
including whether they operate globally, these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are, including political, economic and regulatory risks, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and volatility of commodity and other input
prices. Either partner might fail to recognize alliance relationships that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected.



Furthermore, we may not be able to complete, on terms favorable to us, desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that
do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets. Our divestiture activities, or related activities such as reorganizations, restructuring programs and transformation initiatives, may require us to recognize impairment
charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture. Gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may also affect our profitability.

Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We must correctly predict, identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new products that meet those changes.

Consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually. Our success depends on our ability to predict, identify and interpret the tastes, dietary
habits, packaging, sales channel and other preferences of consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to these preferences. Moreover, weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other factors could affect
consumer preferences and demand. If we do not offer products that appeal to consumers or if we misjudge consumer demand for our products, our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer.

We must distinguish among short-term fads, mid-term trends and long-term changes in consumer preferences. If we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer
preferences will be long-term, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those changing preferences, our sales could decline. In addition, because of our varied consumer base, including by geography, we must offer an array of
products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. If we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories, or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories, demand
for our products could decrease and our profitability could suffer.

Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health, environmental and social implications of
certain food products and ingredients could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. For example, consumers have increasingly focused on health and wellness, including weight management and
reducing sodium and added sugar consumption. In addition, consumer preferences differ by region, and we must monitor and adjust our use of ingredients to respond to these regional preferences. We might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively
respond to changing consumer preferences and social expectations. Continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales, financial condition and results of
operations.

We could fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting.

The accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations. These limitations include, among others, the possibility
of human error, inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud. If we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation
and fair presentation of our financial statements, including in connection with controls executed for us by third parties, we might fail to timely detect any misappropriation of corporate assets or inappropriate allocation or use of funds and could
be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis. As a result, our reputation, results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected.

We increasingly rely on information technology and third party service providers.

We rely on information technology and third party service providers to process, transmit and store company information via business applications, internal networks and
the Internet. We use these technologies and third party service providers to support our global business processes and activities, including communicating with our employees, customers and suppliers; running critical business operations; engaging in
mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions; conducting research and development activities; meeting regulatory, legal and tax requirements; and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities.



Working with these technologies and third party service providers creates risks related to confidentiality, integrity and
continuity, and some of these risks may be outside of our control. Confidentiality and integrity of information may be jeopardized by deliberate or unintentional misuse, manipulation or disclosure of information; physical theft; or cybersecurity
data breaches by our employees, suppliers, hackers, criminal groups, nation-state organizations, social-activist organizations or other third parties. We currently utilize third party e-commerce providers and request that they have the appropriate
cybersecurity controls and meet regulatory requirements. Going forward, should we decide to transact e-commerce direct to consumers as the merchant, we would implement additional procedures, controls and technology to address cybersecurity and
regulatory compliance. We might face increased risk if new initiatives such as

e-commerce

increase the amount of confidential information that we process and maintain, and the cybersecurity and compliance
controls we or our third party providers implement are not effective. Continuity of business applications and services may be disrupted by errors in systems’ maintenance, migration of applications to the cloud, power outages, hardware or
software failures, viruses or malware, denial of service and other cyber security attacks, telecommunication failures, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other catastrophic events.

Should any of these risks materialize, the need to coordinate with various third party service providers might complicate our efforts to resolve the related issues. If
our controls, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we may experience
delays in reporting our financial results.

In addition, should confidential information belonging to us or our employees, customers, consumers, partners,
suppliers, or governmental or regulatory authorities be misused or breached, we may suffer financial losses relating to remediation, damage to our reputation or brands, loss of intellectual property, or penalties or litigation related to violation
of data privacy laws and regulations.

Weak financial performance, downgrades in our credit ratings, illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic
conditions could limit our access to the global capital markets, reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs.

We access the long-term and short-term
global capital markets to obtain financing. Our financial performance, our

short-

and long-term debt credit ratings, interest rates, the stability of financial institutions with which we partner, the liquidity
of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy, including the food industry, could affect our access to, and the availability or cost of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions and our ability to pay dividends in the
future. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the global capital markets on terms we find acceptable.

We regularly access the commercial paper
markets in the United States and Europe for ongoing funding requirements. A downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper. Disruptions in the
global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short- and long-term debt
offerings.

Limitations on our ability to access the global capital markets, a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Volatility in the equity markets, interest rates, our participation in multi-employer
pension plans or other factors could substantially increase our pension costs.

We sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for our employees
throughout the world. At the end of 2016, the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was $11.4 billion and plan assets were $9.5 billion. The difference between plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the
plans, significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Our largest funded defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified
portfolio of investments, including equities and corporate and government debt. Among other factors, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, investment returns, funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans
operate, the viability of other employers in the multi-employer pension plans in which we participate and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding, cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and increase our future
funding requirements. Legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation.



Volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we are required to make additional cash contributions
to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net periodic pension cost.

Due to our participation in multi-employer pension plans, we may have
exposure under those plans that extends beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our employees. Our contributions to a multi-employer plan may increase beyond our bargaining obligations depending on the financial condition of the
multi-employer plan. We may be required to participate in funding the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable to a withdrawing employer, and our costs might increase as a result. Further, if we partially or completely withdraw from a
multi-employer pension plan, we may be required to pay a partial or complete withdrawal liability. This withdrawal liability will generally increase if there is also a mass withdrawal of other participating employers or if the plan terminates. (See
Note 9,

Benefit Plans

, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our multi-employer pension plans.)

A significant increase in our
pension benefit obligations or funding requirements could curtail our ability to invest in the business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our failure to protect our valuable intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our products and brands.

We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licensing agreements, to
be a significant and valuable part of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in various countries, as well as licensing
agreements, third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes
that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.

We may be unaware of third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology, brands or products. Any litigation regarding patents or other
intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations. Third party claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay
monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation, product sales,
financial condition and results of operations.

Item 2.  Properties.

On December 31, 2016, we had 150 manufacturing and processing facilities in 52 countries and 130 distribution centers and depots worldwide. During 2016, we added 5
new manufacturing facilities and disposed of or ceased operations in 9 manufacturing facilities. We also added 4 new distribution facilities and no longer own or lease 12 distribution facilities. In addition, a decrease of 49 distribution facilities
in predominantly EU and AMEA primarily reflects distribution facilities that are owned or leased by third party logistics partners. In addition to our owned or leased properties listed below, we also utilize a highly distributed network of
warehouses and distribution centers that are owned or leased by third party logistics partners, contract manufacturers, co-packers or other strategic partners. We believe we have or will add sufficient capacity to meet our planned operating needs.
It is our practice to maintain all of our plants and other facilities in good condition.

Item 7.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. It should be read in conjunction with the other sections of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.

Description of the Company

We manufacture and market primarily snack food
products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy and various cheese & grocery products, as well as powdered beverage products. We have operations in more than 80 countries and sell our
products in approximately 165 countries.

We aim to deliver strong, profitable long-term growth by accelerating our core snacks business and expanding the reach of
our Power Brands globally. Leveraging our Power brands and our innovation platforms, we plan to innovate boldly and connect with our consumers wherever they are, including new markets around the world, using both traditional and digital channels. As
consumer consumption patterns change to more accessible, frequent and better-for-you snacking, we are enhancing the goodness of many of our brands (including providing simpler and wholesome ingredient-focused snacks), expanding the well-being
offerings in our portfolio and inspiring consumers to snack mindfully by providing clear and simple nutrition information. As shopping expands further online, we are also working to grow our e-commerce platform and on-line presence with consumers.
To fuel these investments, we have been working to optimize our cost structure. These efforts include reinventing our supply chain, including adding and upgrading to more efficient production lines, while reducing the complexity of our product
offerings, ingredients and number of suppliers. We also continue to aggressively manage our overhead costs. We have embraced and embedded zero-based budgeting practices across the organization to identify potential areas of cost reductions and
capture and sustain savings within our ongoing operating budgets. Through these actions, we’re leveraging our brands, platforms and capabilities to drive long-term value and return on investment for our shareholders.

Coffee Business Transactions

JDE Coffee Business Transactions:

On July 2, 2015, we completed transactions to combine our wholly owned coffee businesses with those of DEMB to create a new company, JDE. At that time, our equity
interest in JDE was 43.5% with the remaining 56.5% held by a subsidiary of Acorn Holdings B.V. (“AHBV,” owner of DEMB prior to July 2, 2015). In connection with these transactions, in 2015, we recorded a final pre-tax gain of $6.8
billion ($6.6 billion after-tax) from the deconsolidation of our legacy coffee businesses. We also recorded approximately $1.0 billion of cumulative pre-tax net gains ($436 million in 2015 and $628 million in 2014) and cash related to currency
hedging in connection with the expected cash consideration to be received in euros. We received

€

3.8 billion of cash ($4.2 billion) as of July 2, 2015 and with the cash from hedging
currency, we effectively received $5.2 billion of cash. On July 5, 2016, we also received from JDE an expected $275 million cash payment to settle a receivable for tax formation costs that were part of the initial sales price. As part of our
final sales price negotiations, we also retained the right to collect future cash payments if certain estimated pension liabilities are realized over an agreed amount in the future. As such, we may recognize additional income related to this
negotiated term in the future. As further described below, following the March 2016 exchange of JDE shares for an investment in Keurig and stock-based compensation activity at JDE during 2016, as of December 31, 2016, our equity interest in JDE
was 26.4%. We recorded equity earnings of $100 million in 2016 and equity losses of $58 million in 2015 related to our investment in JDE.

On June 30, 2016, we
entered into agreements with AHBV and its affiliates to establish a new stock-based compensation arrangement tied to the issuance of JDE equity compensation awards to JDE employees. This arrangement replaced a temporary equity compensation program
tied to the issuance of AHBV equity compensation to JDE employees. New Class C, D and E JDE shares were authorized and issued for investments made by JDE employees and to issue shares when JDE awards vest. As new shares of JDE are issued, the
Class A and B ownership interests of JDE decrease. Under these arrangements, dilution of the JDE shares is limited to 2%. Based on estimated award achievement, we do not expect our JDE ownership interest to decrease below 26.27%. Following
these stock-based compensation issuances, our ownership interest in JDE was 26.4% as of December 31, 2016.

See Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions,

for additional details on the JDE coffee business transactions.



Keurig Transaction:

On
March 3, 2016, a subsidiary of AHBV completed a $13.9 billion acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of Keurig through a merger transaction. On March 7, 2016, we exchanged with a subsidiary of AHBV a portion of our equity
interest in JDE with a carrying value of

€

1.7 billion (approximately $2.0 billion as of March 7, 2016) for an interest in Keurig with a fair value of $2.0 billion based on the merger
consideration per share for Keurig. We recorded the difference between the fair value of Keurig and our basis in JDE shares as a $43 million gain on the equity method investment exchange. Following the exchange, our ownership interest in JDE became
26.5% and we owned a 24.2% interest in Keurig. Both AHBV and we hold our investments in Keurig through a combination of equity and shareholder loan interests, with the same pro-rata ownership of each. Our initial $2.0 billion investment in Keurig
includes a $1.6 billion Keurig equity interest and a $0.4 billion shareholder loan receivable, which are reported on a combined basis within equity method investments on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. The
shareholder loan has a 5.5% interest rate and is payable at the end of a seven-year term on February 27, 2023. Within equity earnings, we recorded equity earnings of $77 million and interest income from the shareholder loan of $20 million in
2016. Additionally, we received $14 million of interest payments on the shareholder loan and $4 million in dividends on our investment in Keurig in 2016. See Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions,

for additional details on the Keurig
transaction.

Coffee Business Equity Earnings:

We have reflected the
results of our historical coffee businesses and equity earnings from JDE, Keurig and Dongsuh Foods Corporation (“DSF”) in our results from continuing operations as the coffee category continues to be a significant part of our net earnings
and business strategy going forward. Historically, our coffee businesses and the income from equity method investments were recorded within our operating income as these businesses were part of our base business. While we retain an ongoing interest
in coffee through equity method investments including JDE, Keurig and DSF, and we have significant influence with our equity method investments, we do not control these operations directly. As such, in the third quarter of 2015, we began to
recognize equity method investment earnings, consisting primarily of investments in coffee businesses, outside of operating income. For periods prior to the third quarter of 2015, our historical coffee business and equity method investment earnings
were included within our operating income. See Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions,

for more information.

Venezuela Deconsolidation

Effective as of the close of the 2015 fiscal year, we concluded that we no longer met the accounting criteria for consolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries due to a
loss of control over our Venezuelan operations and an other-than-temporary lack of currency exchangeability. At that time, we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our Venezuelan operations. We recorded a $778 million
pre-tax loss on December 31, 2015 as we reduced the value of our cost method investment in Venezuela and all Venezuelan receivables held by our other subsidiaries to realizable fair value, resulting in full impairment. The recorded loss also
included historical cumulative translation adjustments related to our Venezuelan operations that had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses within equity.

As of the start of 2016, we no longer include net revenues, earnings or net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries within our consolidated financial statements in our
reported GAAP results (we exclude Venezuela in our non-GAAP results for all historical periods presented). Under the cost method of accounting, earnings are only recognized to the extent cash is received and we have not received any distributed cash
from our Venezuela operations in 2016. Given the current and ongoing difficult economic, regulatory and business environment in Venezuela, there continues to be significant uncertainty related to our operations in Venezuela, and we expect these
conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. We monitor the extent of our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and the liquidity and availability of cash and U.S. dollars needed to operate in Venezuela, as our current situation in
Venezuela may change over time and lead to consolidation at a future date. See

Summary of Results

•

Net revenues decreased 12.5% to $25.9 billion in 2016 and decreased 13.5% to $29.6 billion in 2015. Net revenues in 2016 were significantly affected by the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, unfavorable
currency translation as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year, the deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan operations and the year-over-year impact of the
accounting calendar change in 2015.



•

Organic Net Revenue increased 1.3% to $27.1 billion in 2016 and increased 1.4% to $30.1 billion in 2015 after recasting prior years to exclude the historical Venezuela deconsolidated operating results and historical
operating results from a small 2016 divestiture in the Latin America region. Organic Net Revenue also excludes the impact of our historical global coffee business which was deconsolidated in the JDE coffee business transactions in July 2015. Organic
Net Revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure and is on a constant currency basis. We use Organic Net Revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the definition of Organic Net Revenue and our
reconciliation with net revenues within

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

appearing later in this section).

•

Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International decreased 76.4% to $1.05 in 2016 and increased 246.9% to $4.44 in 2015. The gain on the coffee business deconsolidation and other significant items affected the
comparability of our reported results, as further described in the

Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results

appearing later in this section and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

•

Adjusted EPS increased 19.8% to $1.94 in 2016 and decreased 6.4% to $1.62 in 2015 after recasting prior years to exclude the historical Venezuela deconsolidated operating results, historical operating results from a
small 2016 divestiture in the Latin America region and historical mark-to-market impacts. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 24.1% to $2.01 in 2016 and increased 9.8% to $1.90 in 2015. Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS on a constant
currency basis are non-GAAP financial measures. We use these measures as they provide improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the definition of Adjusted EPS and our reconciliation with diluted EPS within

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures

appearing later in this section).

Financial Outlook

We seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating
Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations such as margins internally to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near- and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believe
these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. GAAP financial results. We believe providing investors with the same financial information that we use internally ensures that investors have the
same data to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and gain additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures should
always be considered in relation to our GAAP results and we have provided reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

which appears later in this section.

In addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of developments or trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives.

Long-Term Demographics and Consumer Trends

– Snack food consumption is highly correlated to GDP growth, urbanization of the population and rising
discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets. Over the long-term, we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in consumer behaviors such as migration to more frequent, smaller meals
and snacks and greater use of convenience foods. In the near term, low GDP growth, economic recessionary pressures, weak consumer confidence, a strong U.S. dollar and changing consumer trends have slowed category and our net revenue growth. We
recognize these factors and the changing consumer trends such as the increasing emphasis on well-being, time compression, growing income disparity, digital revolution and an evolving retail landscape, and we are investing in our well-being snacks
portfolio, product and marketing innovation and new routes to market including e-commerce to position ourselves for future growth.

Demand

– We monitor
consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. Growth in these global categories (excluding Venezuela) decreased from approximately 3.4% in 2015 to 2.4% in 2016. Over the long-term, we
expect category growth to improve when the macroeconomic environment improves. We continue to make investments in our brand portfolio and build strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets. In doing so,
we anticipate driving demand in our categories and growing our position in these markets.

Volatility of Global Markets

– Our growth strategy depends in
part on our ability to expand our operations, particularly in emerging markets. Some of these markets have greater political and economic volatility, vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and sensitivity to world oil and energy
prices, as we noted this past year in markets including Brazil, Russia, India, China, Ukraine, the Middle East and Nigeria. Volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate
our business. We expect continued volatility across our markets, particularly emerging markets. As such, we are focused on investing in our global Power Brands and routes to market while we protect our margins through the management of costs and
pricing.



Competition

– We operate in highly competitive markets that include global, regional and local competitors. Our
advantaged geographic footprint, operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our market-leading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell. To grow and maintain our market positions,
we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through new product innovations and product quality. We also continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development,
advertising, marketing and consumer promotions.

Pricing

– We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand, the competitive
environment and changes in our product input costs. Our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions. In 2015 and 2016, we generally increased prices in response to higher commodity costs,
currency and other market factors. In 2017, we anticipate that we will adjust our prices in response to changing market conditions. Price competition or delayed price increases by competitors or customers may continue to affect net revenues or
market share in the near term as the market adjusts to the changes in input costs and other market conditions.

Operating Costs

– Our operating costs
include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions,
refinancing and tax planning. We also continue to work on programs to expand our profitability and margins, such as our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both
our supply chain and overhead costs. We also integrated our EEMEA business into our Europe and Asia Pacific segments effective October 1, 2016. We expect this change to have a favorable impact on our operating performance prospectively due to
greater leverage of our European and AMEA regional businesses and resulting cost structure. We also began to re-negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering eight U.S. facilities that expired in February 2016. We continue to work toward
reaching a new agreement and have plans to ensure business continuity during the re-negotiations.

Currency

– As a global company with 75.6% of our net
revenues generated outside the United States, we are exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements. In the last three years, the U.S. dollar has generally strengthened relative to other currencies in which we operate, and
several countries experienced significant declines in or devaluations of their currency. These currency movements had a significant negative effect on our reported results of operations. Our 2016 net revenues were $25.9 billion, down 12.5% from
2015, including a negative 4.6 percentage point impact from currency translation. Our 2015 net revenues were $29.6 billion, down 13.5% from 2014, including a negative 12.6 percentage point impact from currency translation (and a 12.0 percentage
point impact excluding currency impacts related to Venezuela). Our 2014 net revenues were $34.2 billion, down 3.0% from 2013, including a negative 5.2 percentage point impact from currency translation (and a 3.9 percentage point impact excluding
currency impacts related to Venezuela).

We have historically been exposed to currency devaluation risks impacting earnings particularly, but not only, in
connection with our Venezuela operations that were deconsolidated at the close of the 2015 fiscal year. In the months following Brexit, there was significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, affecting the markets
in which we conduct business. The value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar declined significantly with further volatility in the exchange rate expected over the Brexit transition period. The devaluation of the British pound
sterling negatively affected our translated results reported in U.S. dollars. To partially offset the translation of certain of our overseas operations, including the United Kingdom, we have net investment hedges in the form of local currency
denominated debt. We generally do not hedge against currency translation and primarily seek to hedge against economic losses on cross-currency transactions. Due to limited markets for hedging currency transactions and other factors, we may not be
able to effectively hedge all of our cross-currency transaction risks. The local economies, monetary policies and currency hedging availability can affect our ability to hedge against currency-related economic losses. While we work to mitigate our
exposure to these currency risks, factors such as continued global and local market volatility, actions by foreign governments, political uncertainty, limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to further unfavorable currency impacts
in the future. While we continue to monitor and work to safeguard our business, Brexit could adversely affect future demand for our products, our financial results and operations, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees in the
short or long-term. We may not be able to fully offset the increased risks related to Brexit, which could impact profitability in the near-term or longer should these conditions continue. See Note 1,

Financing Costs

– We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt. We continue to use lower-cost, short- and long-term debt to finance our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, dividends and share repurchases. During
2016, we retired $6.2 billion of our long-term debt and related costs and issued lower-cost, long-term euro, Swiss franc and U.S. dollar-denominated debt. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2016 was 2.2%,
down from 3.7% as of December 31, 2015 and down from 4.3% as of December 31, 2014. Refer to Note 7,

Net revenue decline of 12.5% was driven by the impact of the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, unfavorable
currency, the deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan operations and the year-over-year impact of the 2015 accounting calendar change, partially offset by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 1.3% and the impact of acquisitions. The
adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,627 million for 2016. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,244 million, due primarily to the strength of
the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the Argentinean peso, British pound sterling, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Chinese yuan and Russian ruble. The deconsolidation of our historical Venezuelan operations resulted in a
year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,217 million for 2016. The North America segment accounting calendar change in 2015 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $76 million for 2016. Our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth
was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume / mix. Net pricing was up, which includes the benefit of carryover pricing from 2015 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2016. Higher net
pricing was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe and North America. Unfavorable volume / mix was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, mostly offset by favorable volume / mix in Europe and North
America. Unfavorable volume / mix in Latin America and AMEA was largely due to price elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. The impact of acquisitions primarily includes the July 15, 2015 acquisition
of a biscuit operation in Vietnam, which added $71 million of incremental net revenues for 2016, and the November 2, 2016 purchase of a license to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits in additional key markets, which added $16
million of incremental net revenues for 2016.

Includes costs incurred and accrued related to the planned sale of a confectionery business in France. Refer to Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions,

for more information.

During 2016, we realized higher net pricing while input costs increased modestly. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in
2015, was reflected in Latin America and AMEA, partially offset by lower net pricing in Europe and North America. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on
imported materials, which were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity. Unfavorable volume / mix was driven by Latin America and AMEA, which was mostly offset by favorable volume / mix in Europe and North America.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $1,037 million from 2015, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the
deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, a favorable currency impact, lower costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, gains on the sales of property, VAT-related
settlements and the absence of devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela in 2016. The decreases were partially offset by increases from divestiture-related costs associated with the planned sale of a confectionery business
in France, the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, higher implementation costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and the impact of acquisitions.

Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $322 million from 2015. The decrease was driven primarily by lower overhead
costs due to continued cost reduction efforts.

We recorded a benefit of $54 million in 2016 from VAT-related settlements in Latin America as compared to $30
million in 2015. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $176 million due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the British pound sterling, Argentinean peso and Mexican peso.

Excluding the portion related to deconsolidating our historical coffee business, the change in mark-to-market gains / (losses) from derivatives decreased operating
income by $150 million in 2016. In 2016, the net unrealized losses on commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives were $94 million, as compared to net unrealized gains of $56 million ($96 million including coffee related
activity) in 2015.

Operating income margin decreased from 30.0% in 2015, to 9.9% in 2016. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by last
year’s pre-tax gain on the JDE coffee business transactions, the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, the unfavorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains / losses from
derivatives, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, divestiture-related costs associated with the planned sale of a confectionery business in France, higher intangible asset impairment charges and the reclassification of
equity method earnings. The items that decreased our operating income margin were partially offset by the prior-year loss on the Venezuela deconsolidation, an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin and the absence of costs associated with
the JDE coffee business transactions. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 13.0% in 2015 to 15.3% in 2016. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by lower overheads from cost reduction programs, improved
gross margin reflecting productivity efforts, gains on sales of property and VAT-related settlements.

Net revenue decline of 13.5% was
driven by unfavorable currency and the impact of the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, partially offset by the historical results of our Venezuelan operations, our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 1.4%, the impact of
acquisitions and the impact of an accounting calendar change. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $3,565 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, including the euro, Brazilian real,
Russian ruble, Australian dollar and British pound sterling. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $2,149 million for 2015. The historical results of our Venezuelan
subsidiaries prior to the December 31, 2015 deconsolidation contributed a year-over year increase in net revenues of $457 million for 2015. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume /
mix. Net pricing was up as we realized the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during the year. Higher net pricing was reflected across all segments. Unfavorable volume / mix was largely due to price elasticity as well as strategic
decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume / mix was reflected in all segments except North America. The July 2015 acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam added $128 million in incremental net revenues (constant
currency basis) for the year. The February 2015 acquisition of the Enjoy Life Foods snack food business in North America added $37 million in incremental net revenues for the year. The North America segment accounting calendar change resulted in a
year-over-year increase in net revenues of $78 million for the year.

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with
the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity
method earnings from Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis.

During 2015, higher net pricing outpaced increased input costs. Higher net pricing, due to
input-cost driven pricing actions taken during the year, was reflected across all segments. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials,
partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Unfavorable volume / mix was reflected across all segments.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased $880 million from 2014, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, a favorable currency impact, the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business, lower devaluation charges related to our net
monetary assets in Venezuela and the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs. The decreases were partially offset by increases from higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, costs associated with the coffee business
transactions, lower value-added tax (“VAT”)-related settlements, the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, the impact of acquisitions and a gain on a sale of property in 2014.

Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $321 million from 2014. The increase was driven primarily by higher
advertising and consumer promotions support, particularly behind our Power Brands.

We recorded a benefit of $30 million in 2015 from VAT-related settlements in
Latin America as compared to $84 million in 2014. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by $453 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the euro, Brazilian real, British
pound sterling, Australian dollar and Russian ruble.

Excluding the portion related to deconsolidating our historical coffee business, the change in unrealized
gains / (losses) increased operating income by $129 million in 2015. In 2015, the net unrealized gains on currency and commodity hedging activity were $56 million ($96 million including coffee related activity), as compared to net unrealized losses
of $73 million ($112 million including coffee related activity) in 2014 related to currency and commodity hedging activity.

Operating income margin increased from
9.5% in 2014 to 30.0% in 2015. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the pre-tax gain on the coffee business transactions, an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin, the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program
costs, the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains / losses from derivatives and lower devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela. The items that increased operating income margin were partially offset by the
loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and costs associated with the coffee business transactions. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 12.0% in 2014 to 13.0% in 2015. The
increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily by improved gross margin, reflecting productivity efforts, and improved overhead leverage from cost reduction programs, partially offset by increased advertising and consumer
promotions support.

Results of Operations by Reportable Segment

Our operations and management
structure are organized into four reportable operating segments:

•

Latin America

•

AMEA

•

Europe

•

North America

On October 1, 2016, we integrated our EEMEA operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific
operating segments to further leverage and optimize the operating scale built within the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined within our Europe operating segment, while the remaining
Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific region to form a new AMEA regional operating segment. We have reflected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented.

We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth
opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments were part of our base business. Beginning in the
third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for our new coffee equity method investment in JDE, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in equity method investment earnings outside of segment operating income. For
the six months ended December 31, 2015, after-tax equity method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis. Earnings from equity method investments through July 2, 2015 recorded within segment operating income
were $52 million in AMEA and $4 million in North America. For the year ended December 31, 2014 these earnings were $104 million in AMEA and $9 million in North America. See Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Principles
of Consolidation,

and Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions,

for additional information.



In 2015, we also began to report stock-based compensation for our corporate employees within general corporate expenses
that were reported within our North America region. We reclassified $32 million of corporate stock-based compensation expense in 2015 from the North America segment to general corporate expenses.

We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze
segment performance and trends. See Note 16,

2016 compared with 2015:

Net
revenues decreased $1,596 million (32.0%), due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations (21.9 pp), unfavorable currency (14.8 pp), unfavorable volume / mix (5.3 pp) and the impact of a divestiture (0.1 pp), partially offset by higher net
pricing (10.1 pp). The deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,217 million. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most
currencies in the region, including the Argentinean peso and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume / mix, which primarily occurred in Brazil and Argentina, was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit
certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume / mix was driven by declines in all categories except for cheese & grocery. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.

Segment operating income decreased $214 million (44.1%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, unfavorable
volume / mix and unfavorable currency. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including higher year-over year VAT-related settlements), lower manufacturing
costs, lower advertising and consumer promotion costs, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and the absence of remeasurement losses in 2016 related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela.

2015 compared with 2014:

Net revenues decreased $165 million (3.2%),
due to unfavorable currency (21.0 pp), unfavorable volume / mix (5.1 pp) and the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (0.1 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (12.0 pp) and the favorable historical results of
our Venezuelan subsidiaries prior to the December 31, 2015 deconsolidation (11.0 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Brazilian real,
Mexican peso and Argentinean peso. Unfavorable volume / mix was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume / mix was driven by declines in
chocolate, refreshment beverages and cheese & grocery, partially offset by gains in biscuits, gum & candy. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of
$5 million. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories. Both the unfavorable volume / mix and higher net pricing were driven primarily by Brazil and Argentina.

Segment operating income increased $10 million (2.1%), primarily due to higher net pricing, higher remeasurement losses in 2014 related to our net monetary assets in
Venezuela, the favorable historical results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries prior to the December 31, 2015 deconsolidation, lower manufacturing costs and the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs. These favorable items were partially
offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable currency, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including lower year-over-year VAT-related settlements), unfavorable volume / mix,
higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and an intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 related to a biscuit trademark.

Net
revenues decreased $186 million (3.1%), due to unfavorable currency (3.7 pp), the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (1.1 pp) and unfavorable volume / mix (1.0 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (1.5 pp) and
the impact of an acquisition (1.2 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, South African rand, Egyptian pound,
Nigerian naira, Australian dollar and Philippine peso, partially offset by the strength of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net
revenues of $66 million. Unfavorable volume / mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by declines in candy, cheese & grocery, refreshment beverages and chocolate,
partially offset by gains in biscuits and gum. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, candy, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by lower net pricing in cheese & grocery and gum. The acquisition of a biscuit operation
in Vietnam in July 2015 added net revenues of $71 million (constant currency basis).

Segment operating income increased $117 million (30.1%), primarily due to
lower manufacturing costs, higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the absence of costs associated with the coffee business transactions, the impact
of the Vietnam acquisition and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, unfavorable volume / mix, unfavorable
currency, the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, and the impact of divestitures.

2015 compared with 2014:

Net revenues decreased $365 million (5.7%), due to unfavorable currency (8.8 pp), unfavorable volume / mix (2.5 pp) and the adjustment for deconsolidating our
historical coffee business (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (4.2 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (2.0 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies in
the region, including the Australian dollar, South African rand, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Nigerian naira, Chinese yuan and Egyptian pound. Unfavorable volume / mix was due largely to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic
decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume / mix was driven by declines in all categories except biscuits and gum. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in
net revenues of $49 million. Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam in July 2015 added net revenues of $128 million (constant currency basis).

Segment operating income decreased $141 million (26.6%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program,
higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable currency, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including a phase-out of a local tax incentive program), the reclassification of equity method investment earnings,
unfavorable volume / mix, the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business, costs associated with the coffee business transactions and higher other acquisition-related integration costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset
by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, the impact of the Vietnam acquisition and lower intangible asset impairment charges (related to candy and biscuit trademarks in 2015 and a
biscuit trademark in 2014).

impact of an acquisition (0.1 pp). The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,561 million. Unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar
against most currencies in the region, primarily the British pound sterling. Lower net pricing was reflected across most categories except gum and refreshment beverages. Favorable volume / mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions
to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by biscuits, chocolate and cheese & grocery, partially offset by declines in gum, refreshment beverages and candy. The purchase of the license to manufacture, market and sell
Cadbury-branded biscuits in November 2016 added net revenues of $16 million (constant currency basis).

Segment operating income decreased $83 million (6.1%),
primarily due to the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, unfavorable currency, higher raw material costs, divestiture-related costs, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, lower net pricing and higher
intangible asset impairment charges. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the JDE coffee business transactions, lower manufacturing costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and
favorable volume / mix.

2015 compared with 2014:

Net revenues
decreased $4,116 million (26.1%), due to unfavorable currency (16.2 pp), the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (9.4 pp) and unfavorable volume / mix (3.3 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.8 pp). Unfavorable
currency impacts primarily reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar against most currencies in the region, including the euro and British pound sterling. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year
decrease in net revenues of $2,095 million. Unfavorable volume / mix was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume / mix was driven by declines
in chocolate, gum, refreshment beverages and cheese & grocery, partially offset by gains in biscuits. Higher net pricing was driven by chocolate, gum and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in cheese & grocery and
refreshment beverages.

Segment operating income decreased $602 million (30.8%), primarily due to the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business,
unfavorable currency, higher raw material costs, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, costs associated with the coffee business transactions, unfavorable volume / mix, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and
higher intangible asset impairment charges related to a candy trademark. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, the lower manufacturing costs, absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs and lower other selling,
general and administrative expenses (net of the unfavorable year-over-year impact from the 2014 gain on a sale of property in the United Kingdom).

Net
revenues decreased $14 million (0.2%), due to the impact of an accounting calendar change made in the prior year (1.1 pp), unfavorable currency (0.3 pp) and lower net pricing (0.2 pp), partially offset by favorable volume/mix (1.4 pp). The
prior-year change in North America’s accounting calendar resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $76 million. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Lower net
pricing was reflected in biscuits, partially offset by higher net pricing in chocolate, gum and candy. Favorable volume / mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by gains in
biscuits and candy, partially offset by declines in gum and chocolate.

Segment operating income decreased $27 million (2.4%), primarily due to higher costs
incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, intangible asset impairment charges, the year-over-year impact of the prior-year accounting calendar change, higher raw material costs and lower net
pricing. These unfavorable items were mostly offset by lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including the gain on sale of property), lower manufacturing costs, favorable volume/mix and the gain on the sale of an intangible
asset.

2015 compared with 2014:

Net revenues increased $38
million (0.5%), due to an accounting calendar change (1.2 pp), an acquisition (0.5 pp), favorable volume / mix (0.5 pp) and higher net pricing (0.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (2.0 pp). The change in North America’s
accounting calendar added net revenues of $78 million (constant currency basis). The acquisition of the Enjoy Life Foods snack food business in February 2015 added net revenues of $37 million. Favorable volume / mix was driven by gains in biscuits
and candy, partially offset by declines in gum and chocolate. Higher net pricing was reflected in gum and chocolate, partially offset by lower net pricing in biscuits and candy. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the U.S. dollar
relative to the Canadian dollar.

Segment operating income increased $183 million (19.8%), primarily due to the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs,
lower manufacturing costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including the reclassification of corporate stock-based compensation), the impact of an accounting calendar change, higher net pricing and lower raw material costs.
These favorable items were partially offset by higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, unfavorable currency, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable volume / mix and the reclassification of equity method
investment earnings.



Critical Accounting Estimates

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and
assumptions. Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We have
discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. The following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.

Goodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets:

We test goodwill and
non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on October 1. We assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors
affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on
factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. Quantitative impairment testing consists of a two-step evaluation. The
first step compares a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and
estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.7% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For our Latin America and AMEA
reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.7%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions, and our actual
results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would apply a second step to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. If
the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the implied fair value of the goodwill.

On October 1, 2016, we integrated our EEMEA operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments. As a result, EEMEA goodwill of $1.3 billion was
reallocated to new reporting units based on the relative fair value of the EEMEA component businesses that moved to the Europe and Asia Pacific segments. Goodwill by segment as of December 31, 2016 reflects the results of the reallocation and
the December 31, 2015 goodwill by segment information was recast to reflect the October 1, 2016 reallocation of goodwill.

On July 2, 2015, we
deconsolidated our global coffee businesses from our Europe and AMEA segments. Goodwill was deconsolidated from the impacted reporting units based on relative fair values of the coffee and remaining businesses. Intangible assets contributed with the
coffee business transactions were specifically identified. We deconsolidated total goodwill of $1,664 million and intangible assets of less than $1 million during the third quarter of 2015. Refer to Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions –
JDE Coffee Business Transactions

, for more information.

In 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2016 annual
impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation
factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.

Annually, we assess non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the
fair value or carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. We
determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to
the estimated fair value.



During our 2016 annual testing of non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded $98 million of impairment charges related
to five trademarks. The impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth in part driven by decisions to redirect support from these trademarks to other regional and global brands, as well as slowdowns in local economies. We recorded
charges related to biscuits, candy and gum trademarks of $41 million in AMEA, $32 million in North America, $22 million in Europe, and $3 million in Latin America. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the
estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method, which utilizes estimates of future sales, growth rates, royalty rates
and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value. During our 2016 intangible asset impairment review, we noted nine brands, including the five impaired trademarks, with $630 million of aggregate book value as of December 31,
2016 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. While these other four intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be
impaired, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2015, we recorded a
charge related to candy and biscuit trademarks of $44 million in our AMEA segment, $22 million in Europe and $5 million in Latin America. Additionally, in connection with the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations on December 31, 2015, we
recorded $12 million of impairment charges within the loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela related to a biscuit trademark. In 2014, we recorded a $48 million charge related to a biscuit trademark in our AMEA segment and a $9 million charge related
to a candy trademark in our Europe segment.

Refer to Note 5,

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

, for additional information.

Trade and marketing programs:

We promote our products with advertising,
marketing, sales incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperative advertising, in-store displays, consumer promotions, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based
incentives. We expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Sales incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and
consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising expenses and sales incentives are charged to operations as a percentage of volume,
based on estimated volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.

Employee Benefit Plans:

We sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout
the world. These include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. For accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and post-retirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates;
expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to
the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and
obligations recognized for the underlying plans.

As permitted by U.S. GAAP, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. The
cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees
expected to receive benefits.

Since pension and post-retirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan
obligations and expenses. The expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses, as many of our pension plans are partially funded. The assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting
these assumptions are described in Note 9,

Benefit Plans

, to the consolidated financial statements.



While we do not anticipate further changes in the 2017 assumptions for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and postretirement
health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a

fifty-basis

point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase / (decrease), on our

calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax
positions. Our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction
and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income
in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. We recognize tax benefits in our financial
statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest
benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a
tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. However, final determination of historical tax liabilities, either by settlement
with tax authorities or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have
a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made.

No taxes have been provided on
undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future events, such as material changes in long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may
apply, which could materially affect our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows.

See Note 14,

Income Taxes

, for additional information on
our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits.

See Note 12,

Commitments and Contingencies

New Accounting Guidance:

See Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe that cash from operations, our $4.5 billion revolving credit facility and our authorized long-term financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our
working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. We continue to utilize our commercial paper program, international credit lines and long-term
debt issuances for regular funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Earnings outside of the United States are considered indefinitely reinvested and no material tax
liability has been accrued as of December 31, 2016. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, including the indefinite reinvestment of our earnings outside of the
United States.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:

Operating
activities provided net cash of $2,838 million in 2016, $3,728 million in 2015 and $3,562 million in 2014. Cash flows from operating activities were lower in 2016 than 2015 due to higher contributions to our pension benefit plans in 2016 and higher
working capital cash improvements in 2015 than in 2016. Cash flows from operating activities in all years were favorably impacted by working capital improvements, primarily due to continually decreasing our cash conversion cycle (a metric that
measures working capital efficiency and utilizes days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand and days payables outstanding) to negative 28 days in 2016, negative 12 days in 2015 and positive 10 days in 2014. Cash flows from operating activities
were favorable in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily due to higher relative working capital cash improvements than in 2014 and significant tax payments in 2014 related to the $2.6 billion Starbucks arbitration award we received in late 2013, partially
offset by higher contributions to our pension benefit plans in 2015.

Net Cash Provided by / (Used in) Investing Activities:

Net cash used in investing activities was $1,029 million in 2016, net cash provided by investing activities was $2,649 million in 2015 and net cash used in
investing activities was $1,642 million in 2014. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 and the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily relate to $4.7 billion
of proceeds, net of divested cash and transaction costs, from the contribution of our global coffee businesses, the divestiture of AGF and the cash receipt of $1.0 billion due to the settlement of currency exchange forward contracts related to our
coffee business transactions in 2015. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 is partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2016 of $290 million. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities
in 2015 relative to 2014 is also driven by lower capital expenditures in 2015 of $128 million, partially offset by the $611 million reduction of cash due to the Venezuela deconsolidation, $501 million of contributed JDE receivables and a $43
million cash payment to fund a capital increase in JDE and $527 million of payments to acquire a biscuit operation in Vietnam and the Enjoy Life Foods snack food business in 2015.

Capital expenditures were $1,224 million in 2016, $1,514 million in 2015 and $1,642 million in 2014. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize
manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2017 capital expenditures to be up to $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. We expect to continue
to fund these expenditures from operations.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:

Net cash used in financing activities was $1,862 million in 2016, $5,883 million in 2015 and $2,688 million in 2014. The decrease in net cash used in financing
activities in 2016 relative to 2015 was primarily due to higher net short-term debt issuances and $1.0 billion of lower share repurchases following the exceptional year of share repurchases using proceeds from the global coffee business transactions
in 2015. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 was primarily due to higher repayments of long-term debt in 2015 (including the tender offers and euro notes maturities), $1.9 billion of higher share
repurchases and higher net short-term debt repayments, partially offset by higher proceeds received from long-term note issuances.

Debt:

From time to time we refinance long-term and short-term debt. Refer to Note 7,

Debt and Borrowing Arrangements

, for details of our tender offers, debt issuances
and maturities during 2016, 2015 and 2014. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to
seasonality, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. The third and fourth quarters of the year typically generate higher cash flows. As such, we may issue
commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital needs.



During 2016, one of our subsidiaries, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), issued debt
totaling $4.5 billion. The operations held by MIHN generated approximately 74.1 percent (or $19.2 billion) of the $25.9 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2016 and represented approximately 81.7 percent (or $20.6 billion) of the
$25.2 billion of net assets as of December 31, 2016.

On February 3, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion long-term financing authority
to replace the prior authority.

In the next 12 months, we expect $1.4 billion of long-term debt will mature as follows:

€

750 million ($789 million as of December 31, 2016) in January 2017,

fr.

175 million Swiss franc notes ($172 million as of December 31, 2016) in March 2017 and $488 million
in August 2017. We expect to fund these repayments with a combination of cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or long-term debt.

Our total
debt was $17.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and $15.4 billion at December 31, 2015. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.41 at December 31, 2016 and 0.35 at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the weighted-average
term of our outstanding long-term debt was 6.6 years. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $2.2 billion in 2016, $2.2 billion in 2015 and $1.9 billion in 2014. We had $2.4 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at
December 31, 2016 and none outstanding as of December 31, 2015, as commercial paper interest rates continued to be favorable in late 2016 and we had a bond maturity refinanced with commercial paper in December 2016. We expect to continue
to use commercial paper borrowings to finance various short or long-term financing needs. We expect to continue to use commercial paper to finance various short and long-term financing needs and to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to
Note 7,

Debt and Borrowing Arrangements

, for more information on our debt and debt covenants.

Commodity Trends

We regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production.
During 2016, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher currency-related costs on our commodity purchases and increased costs for packaging and other raw materials, partially offset by lower costs for nuts,
dairy, energy, sugar, grains and oils and cocoa.

A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and
the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher
pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging
strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag
commodity cost changes temporarily.

We expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2017. While the costs of our
principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below.

Guarantees:

As discussed in Note 12,

Commitments and Contingencies

,
we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31,
2016, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.

In addition, at December 31, 2016, we were contingently liable for
$758 million of guarantees related to our own performance. These include letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes.

Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.

Aggregate Contractual Obligations:

contractual obligations at December 31, 2016.

Amounts include the expected cash payments of our debt excluding capital leases, which are presented separately in the table above. The amounts also exclude $69 million of net unamortized non-cash bond premiums and
discounts and mark-to-market adjustments related to our interest rate swaps recorded in total debt.

(2)

Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our euro, British pound sterling and Swiss franc notes was forecasted using currency exchange rates as
of December 31, 2016. An insignificant amount of interest expense was excluded from the table for a portion of our other non-U.S. debt obligations due to the complexities involved in forecasting expected interest payments.

(3)

Operating lease payments represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.

(4)

Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to
be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a
contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice
(usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.

(5)

Other long-term liabilities include estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2026 of $195 million. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the
payments beyond 2026; as such, they are excluded from the above table. There are also another $179 million of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next 5 years. In addition, the following long-term liabilities
included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, income taxes, insurance accruals and other accruals. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments (or contributions beyond 2017, in
the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. We currently expect to make approximately $468 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2017. As of December 31, 2016, our total liability for income taxes, including uncertain tax
positions and associated accrued interest and penalties, was $899 million. We currently estimate payments of approximately $232 million related to these positions over the next 12 months.



Equity and Dividends

Stock Plans:

See Note 10,

Stock Plans

, to the consolidated
financial statements for more information on our stock plans and grant activity during 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Share Repurchases:

See Note 11,

Capital Stock

, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase and accelerated share repurchase programs.

We intend to continue to use a portion of our cash for share repurchases. On July 29, 2015, our Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of
Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase program, raising the authorization to $13.7 billion of Common Stock repurchases, and extended the program through December 31, 2018. We repurchased $10.8 billion of shares
($2.6 billion in 2016, $3.6 billion in 2015, $1.9 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013) through December 31, 2016. The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors,
including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management
discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate. We may accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice.

Dividends:

We paid dividends of $1,094 million in 2016, $1,008 million in
2015 and $964 million in 2014. On July 19, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.19 per common share or $0.76 per common share on an annual basis. On July 23, 2015, our Board of Directors
approved a 13% increase at that time in the quarterly dividend to $0.17 per common share or $0.68 per common share on an annual basis. On August 5, 2014, our Audit Committee, with authorization from our Board of Directors, approved a 7%
increase at that time in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per common share or $0.60 per common share on an annual basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our
net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.

For U.S. income tax purposes only, the Company has calculated that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in January 2016 are characterized as a qualified
dividend paid from U.S. earnings and profits. The distributions the Company paid to its shareholders in April, July and October are characterized as a return of capital to each shareholder, up to the extent of the shareholder’s tax basis. If a
shareholder does not have sufficient tax basis, these distributions could result in taxable gains to the shareholder. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of all of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends,
including distributions in excess of our U.S. earnings and profits.



Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating
results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our
performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition & divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible
asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe
the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying GAAP results
throughout our

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

in this Form 10-K.

Our primary non-GAAP financial
measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the
related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis.

investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees’ unusual or infrequent items

(8)

, such as acquisition and divestiture-related costs and restructuring program costs.
We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis

(3)

.



(1)

Divestitures include completed sales of businesses and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement.

(2)

In connection with the JDE coffee business transactions that closed on July 2, 2015, because we exchanged our coffee interests for similarly-sized coffee interests in JDE at the time of the transaction, we have
deconsolidated and not included our historical global coffee business results within divestitures in our non-GAAP financial measures and in the related

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

. We continue to have an ongoing interest in the coffee business and as such, we include the earnings of JDE, Keurig and our historical coffee business within continuing results of operations. Within Adjusted EPS, we included these
earnings with equity method investment earnings and deconsolidated our historical coffee business results from Organic Net Revenue and Adjusted Operating Income to facilitate comparisons of past and future coffee operating results.

(3)

Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial
statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.

(4)

Refer to Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions – Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group

, to the consolidated financial statements for more information on Spin-Off Costs incurred in connection with the October 1,
2012 spin-off of the Kraft Foods Group grocery business.

(5)

Non-GAAP adjustments related to the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and
organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments.

(6)

During the third quarter of 2016, we began to exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives from our non-GAAP earnings measures
until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we made this
adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We also discontinued designating commodity and forecasted currency
transaction derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. To facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating results, we have recast all historical non-GAAP earnings measures to exclude the mark-to-market impacts.

(7)

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, we began to
record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income following the deconsolidation of our coffee business. See Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
Principles of Consolidation

, for more information. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity method earnings from our Adjusted Operating Income to after-tax equity method investment earnings within Adjusted EPS to be
consistent with the deconsolidation of our coffee business results on July 2, 2015 and in order to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis.

(8)

We have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ unusual or infrequent items in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. Although we have
shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and unusual or infrequent items with them each reporting period, we do not have direct
control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. Our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. Our GAAP “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz
International from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ unusual and infrequent items.

We believe that the presentation of
these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends
affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by
other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below
that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables
that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K.



Organic Net Revenue:

Applying
the definition of “Organic Net Revenue”, the adjustments made to “net revenues” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, our historical Venezuelan operations, the adjustment for
deconsolidating our historical coffee business, an accounting calendar change, acquisitions and divestiture. We believe that Organic Net Revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved
comparability of results. We also evaluate our Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and Power Brands, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP below.

Each year we reevaluate our Power Brands and confirm the brands in which we will continue to make disproportionate investments. As such, we may make changes in our planned investments in primarily regional Power Brands
following our annual review cycles. For 2016, we made limited changes to our list of regional Power Brands and as such, we reclassified 2015 and 2014 Power Brand net revenues on a basis consistent with the current list of Power Brands.



Adjusted Operating Income:

Applying the definition of “Adjusted Operating Income”, the adjustments made to “operating income” (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure)
were to exclude Spin-Off costs, 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs, Venezuela historical operating results and remeasurement and deconsolidation losses, the JDE coffee business transactions gain and net
incremental costs, operating income from our historical coffee business, equity method investment earnings reclassified to after-tax earnings in Q3 2015 in connection with the coffee business transactions, operating results of the AGF divestiture,
pre-tax gains on the AGF and Costa Rica confectionery business divestitures, divestiture-related costs incurred for the planned sale of a confectionery business in France, gain on sale of an intangible asset, impairment charges related to intangible
assets, the Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs, acquisition-related costs and mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts. We also present “Adjusted Operating Income
margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income, and evaluate Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis. We believe these measures provide improved comparability of underlying operating results.

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with
the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassified the equity method
earnings from Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis.

incremental costs; net earnings from the AGF divestiture; after-tax gain on the Costa Rica confectionery business divestiture and after-tax loss on the AGF divestiture; divestiture-related costs incurred for the planned sale of a confectionery
business in France; gain on sale of intangible asset; impairment charges related to intangible assets; acquisition integration costs; acquisition-related costs; mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative
contracts; a loss on debt extinguishment and related expenses; losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; gain on the equity method investment exchange; and our
proportionate share of unusual or infrequent items recorded by our JDE and Keurig equity method investees. We also evaluate Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. We believe Adjusted EPS provides improved comparability of underlying operating
results.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as
part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results.
We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. For additional information on our derivative
activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 8,

Financial Instruments

.

Many of our non-U.S. subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported
results as we translate the balance sheets, operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting purposes. The translation of non-U.S. dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of
our subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity. A stronger U.S. dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects
our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker U.S. dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets. While we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of non-U.S. operations and
other currency impacts, we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results. See

Consolidated Results of Operations

and

Results of Operations by
Reportable Segment

under

Discussion and Analysis of Historical Results

for currency exchange effects on our financial results. For additional information on the impact of currency policies, Brexit, recent currency devaluations, the
deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operation and the historical remeasurement of our Venezuelan net monetary assets on our financial condition and results of operations, also see Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies—Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting

.

We also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products. Input
costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand, weather conditions, government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions. To manage input cost volatility, we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial
instruments. We also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings.

We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital. Our primary
exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury rates, corporate credit spreads, London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) and commercial paper rates. We periodically use interest rate swaps
and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. In addition to using interest rate derivatives to manage future interest payments, during 2016,
we retired $6.2 billion of our long-term debt and related costs and issued $6.4 billion of lower borrowing cost debt. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt as of December 31, 2016 was 2.2%, down from 3.7% as of December 31,
2015.

There were no significant changes in the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our exposures between December 31, 2015 and December 31,
2016. See Note 8,

Financial Instruments

, for more information on 2016 derivative activity.

Value at Risk:

We use a value at risk (“VAR”) computation to estimate: 1) the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments;
and 2) the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our currency and commodity

price-sensitive

derivative financial instruments. The VAR analysis was done separately for our currency exchange, fixed
income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below. The instruments included in the VAR computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk, debt and swaps for interest rate
risk, and commodity forwards, futures and options for commodity risk. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, which the above-mentioned
instruments are intended to hedge.



The VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric
delta-gamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The
parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange, and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2016 and
2015, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued
accordingly in the VAR computation.

As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest
rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR model, were:

The impacts in the 2015 tables above have not been recast to reflect the deconsolidation of our legacy coffee business or Venezuela
business and the related derivative activity for those businesses as it is impracticable to do so.

This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to
statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The computation does not
represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of
future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, equity and cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mondelēz International, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Mondelēz International, Inc. was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Mondelēz International, Inc., through its subsidiaries (collectively
“Mondelēz International,” “we,” “us” and “our”), sells food and beverage products to consumers in approximately 165 countries.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include
Mondelēz International, Inc. as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. For all periods presented through December 31, 2015, the operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries are included in our consolidated financial
statements. As of the close of the fourth quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan operations from our consolidated financial statements and recognized a loss on deconsolidation. See

Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary
Accounting:

Venezuela

below for more information.

We account for investments in which we exercise significant influence

(20%-50%

ownership interest) under the equity method of accounting. On July 2, 2015, we contributed our global coffee businesses to a new company, Jacobs Douwe Egberts (“JDE”), in which we now
hold an equity interest (collectively, the “JDE coffee business transactions”). Historically, our coffee businesses and the income from equity method investments were recorded within our operating income as these businesses were part of
our base business. While we retain an ongoing interest in coffee through equity method investments including JDE, Keurig Green Mountain Inc. (“Keurig”) and Dongsuh Foods Corporation (“DSF”), and we have significant influence with
our equity method investments, we do not control these operations directly. As such, in the third quarter of 2015, we began to recognize equity method investment earnings, consisting primarily of investments in coffee businesses, outside of
operating income and segment income. For periods prior to the third quarter of 2015, our historical coffee business and equity method investment earnings were included within our operating income and segment income. For the six months ended
December 31, 2015,

after-tax

equity method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis and thus are not shown on our consolidated statement of earnings for this period.
Please see Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions – JDE Coffee Business Transactions

and

Keurig Transaction

, and Note 16,

Segment Reporting

, for more information on these transactions.

We use the cost method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20% and in which we do not exercise significant influence. The
noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling investors’ interests in the results of subsidiaries that we control and consolidate. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.

Use of Estimates:

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, pension and benefit plan assumptions, valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, restructuring program
liabilities, marketing program accruals, insurance and self-insurance reserves and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. If actual amounts differ from estimates, we include
the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our
consolidated financial statements.

Segment Change:

On October 1,
2016, we integrated our Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EEMEA”) operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments to further leverage and optimize the operating scale built within the Europe and Asia Pacific
regions. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined within our Europe region, while the remaining Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific region to form a new Asia, Middle East and Africa
(“AMEA”) operating segment. We have reflected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented.



As of October 1, 2016, our operations and management structure was organized into four reportable operating segments:

•

Latin America

•

AMEA

•

Europe

•

North America

See Note 16,

Segment Reporting

, for additional information on our segments.

Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting:

We translate the
results of operations of our subsidiaries from multiple currencies using average exchange rates during each period and translate balance sheet accounts using exchange rates at the end of each period. We record currency translation adjustments as a
component of equity (except for highly inflationary currencies) and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings. In 2016, none of our consolidated subsidiaries were subject to highly inflationary accounting.

United Kingdom.

On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) voted by referendum to exit the European Union; this vote is commonly referred to as
“Brexit.” The referendum is

non-binding

and the exit from the European Union is not immediate. Once the United Kingdom invokes E.U. Article 50, there is a

two-year

window in which the United Kingdom and the European Commission can negotiate the future terms for imports, exports, taxes, employment, immigration and other areas.

Brexit has caused volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, affecting the markets in which we operate. The implications of Brexit could adversely
affect demand for our products, our financial results and operations, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees in the short or long-term. On June 24, 2016, the value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar
fell by 9%. Since that date, the value of the British pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar declined an additional 11% through December 31, 2016. Further volatility in the exchange rate is expected over the transition period.

As the business operating environment remains uncertain, we continue to monitor our investments and currency exposures abroad. As the United Kingdom is not a
highly-inflationary economy, we record currency translation adjustments within equity and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings. While we did not experience significant business disruptions in our U.K. businesses immediately
following the referendum, the devaluation of the British pound sterling in 2016 adversely affected our translated results reported in U.S. dollars. We have a natural hedge in the form of pound sterling-denominated debt that acts as a net investment
hedge, moving counter to adverse pound sterling currency translation impacts. British pound sterling currency transaction risks are largely mitigated due to our global chocolate businesses buying cocoa in British pound sterling. Our U.K. operations
contributed $2.2 billion, or 8.6% of consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Venezuela.

From January 1, 2010 through
December 31, 2015, we accounted for the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency as prescribed by U.S. GAAP for highly inflationary economies.

Effective as of the close of the 2015 fiscal year, we concluded that we no longer met the accounting criteria for consolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries due to a
loss of control over our Venezuelan operations and an other-than-temporary lack of currency exchangeability. During the fourth quarter of 2015, representatives of the Venezuelan government arbitrarily imposed pricing restrictions on our local
operations that resulted in our inability to recover operating costs. We immediately began an appeal process with the Venezuelan authorities to demonstrate that our pricing was in line with the regulatory requirements. In January 2016, local
officials communicated that some of the pricing restrictions had been lifted; however, the legally required administrative order had not been issued and it was uncertain when it would be issued. The legal and regulatory environment also became more
unreliable. While we had been complying with the Venezuelan law governing pricing and profitability controls and followed the legal process for appeal, the appeal process was not available to us as outlined under law. Additionally, we were
increasingly facing issues procuring raw materials and packaging. Taken together, these actions, the economic environment in Venezuela and the progressively limited access to dollars to import goods through the use of any of the available currency
mechanisms impaired our ability to operate and control our Venezuelan businesses. As a result of these factors, we concluded that we no longer met the criteria for the consolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries.



As of the close of the 2015 fiscal year, we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our Venezuelan
operations. We recorded a $778 million

pre-tax

loss on December 31, 2015 as we reduced the value of our cost method investment in Venezuela and all Venezuelan receivables held by our other
subsidiaries to realizable fair value, resulting in full impairment. The recorded loss also included historical cumulative translation adjustments related to our Venezuelan operations that had previously been recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive losses within equity. The fair value of our investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries was estimated based on discounted cash flow projections of current and expected operating losses in the foreseeable future and our ability to
operate the business on a sustainable basis. Our fair value estimate included U.S. dollar exchange and discount rate assumptions that reflect the inflation and economic uncertainty in Venezuela.

For 2015 and prior periods presented, the operating results of our Venezuela operations were included in our consolidated statements of earnings. During this time, we
recognized a number of currency-related remeasurement losses resulting from devaluations of the Venezuela bolivar exchange rates we historically used to source U.S. dollars for purchases of imported raw materials, packaging and other goods and
services. The following table sets forth a history of the remeasurement losses, the deconsolidation loss and historical operating results and financial position of our Venezuelan subsidiaries for the periods presented:

Represents the financial position of our Venezuelan subsidiaries prior to the accounting change on December 31, 2015.

Beginning in 2016, we no longer include net revenues, earnings or net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries within our consolidated financial statements. Under the cost
method of accounting, earnings are only recognized to the extent cash is received. Given the current and ongoing difficult economic, regulatory and business environment in Venezuela, there continues to be significant uncertainty related to our
operations in Venezuela, and we expect these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. We will monitor the extent of our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and the liquidity and availability of U.S. dollars at different rates,
as our current situation in Venezuela may change over time and lead to consolidation at a future date.

Argentina.

On December 16, 2015, the new
Argentinean government fiscal authority announced the lifting of strict currency controls and reduced restrictions on exports and imports. The next day, the value of the Argentinean peso relative to the U.S. dollar fell by 36%. In 2016, the value of
the Argentinean peso relative to the U.S. dollar declined an additional 23%. Further volatility in the exchange rate is expected. While the business operating environment remains challenging, we continue to monitor and actively manage our investment
and exposures in Argentina. We continue executing our hedging programs and refining our product portfolio to improve our product offerings, mix and profitability. We also continue to implement additional cost reduction initiatives to optimize and
streamline our manufacturing facilities and commercial operations to protect the business together with pricing strategy to offset inflationary pressures. While further currency declines could have an adverse impact on our ongoing results of
operations, we believe the actions by the government to reduce economic controls and business restrictions will provide favorable opportunities for our Argentinean subsidiaries. Our Argentinean operations contributed $583 million, or 2.2% of
consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the net monetary liabilities of our Argentina operations were not material. Argentina is not designated as a highly-inflationary economy for
accounting purposes, so we record currency translation adjustments within equity and realized exchange gains and losses on transactions in earnings.



Other Countries.

Since we have operations in over 80 countries and sell in approximately 165 countries, we monitor
economic and currency-related risks and seek to take protective measures in response to these exposures. Some of the countries in which we do business have recently experienced periods of significant economic uncertainty. These include Brazil,
China, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Nigeria, Ukraine and South Africa, most of which have had either currency devaluation or volatility in exchange rates. We continue to monitor operations, currencies and net monetary exposures in these countries.
At this time, we do not anticipate any risk to our operating results from changing to highly inflationary accounting in these countries.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Transfers of Financial Assets:

We account for transfers of financial
assets, such as uncommitted revolving

non-recourse

accounts receivable factoring arrangements, when we have surrendered control over the related assets. Determining whether control has transferred requires an
evaluation of relevant legal considerations, an assessment of the nature and extent of our continuing involvement with the assets transferred and any other relevant considerations. We use receivable factoring arrangements periodically when
circumstances are favorable to manage liquidity. We have a factoring arrangement with a major global bank for a maximum combined capacity of $802 million. Under the program, we may sell eligible short-term trade receivables to the bank in
exchange for cash. We then continue to collect the receivables sold, acting solely as a collecting agent on behalf of the bank. We also enter into arrangements with customers to achieve earlier collection of receivables. The total incremental cost
of factoring receivables for all regions was $9 million in 2016, $7 million in 2015 and $7 million in 2014 and was recorded in net revenue. The outstanding principal amount of receivables under all arrangements amounted to
$745 million as of December 31, 2016, $666 million as of December 31, 2015 and $421 million as of December 31, 2014.

Accounting
Calendar Change:

In connection with moving toward a common consolidation date across the Company, in the first quarter of 2015, we changed the consolidation
date for our North America segment from the last Saturday of each period to the last calendar day of each period. The change had a favorable impact of $76 million on net revenues and $36 million on operating income in 2015. As a result of
this change, each of our operating subsidiaries now reports results as of the last calendar day of the period. As the effect to prior-period results was not material, we have not revised prior-period results.

Inventories:

We value our inventory using the average cost method. We also
record inventory allowances for overstock and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes.

Long-Lived Assets:

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and
equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 20 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 40 years.

We review
long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for realizability on an ongoing basis. Changes in depreciation, generally accelerated depreciation, are determined and recorded when estimates of the remaining useful lives or residual
values of long-term assets change. We also review for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. In those circumstances, we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to
determine if an impairment exists. When testing for asset impairment, we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. Any impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying
value over its estimated fair value. Fair value is estimated based on the discounted cash flows for the asset group over the remaining useful life or based on the expected cash proceeds for the asset less costs of disposal. Any significant
impairment losses would be recorded within asset impairment and exit costs in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Software Costs:

We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use.
Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which do not exceed seven years.



Goodwill and

Non-Amortizable

Intangible Assets:

We test goodwill and

non-amortizable

intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on October 1. We assess goodwill
impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. We review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for
goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. Annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other
practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. In the event that significant potential goodwill impairment risk exists for a specific reporting unit, we apply a

two-step

quantitative test. The first step compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value. We estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates,
market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. This year, for our Europe and North America reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.7% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. For
our Latin America and AMEA reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.7%. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, industry and economic
conditions, and our actual results and conditions may differ over time. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value, we would apply a second step to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied
fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the implied fair value of the goodwill.

Annually we assess

non-amortizable

intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and
circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. If significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated
fair value with its carrying value. We determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, we consider the asset impaired
and reduce its carrying value to the estimated fair value. We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and evaluate them for impairment as we do other long-lived assets.

Insurance and Self-Insurance:

We use a combination of insurance and
self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and our obligation for employee healthcare benefits. We estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an
undiscounted basis by evaluating and making judgments about historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions and the estimated impact on future results.

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass
to customers, which generally occurs upon delivery or shipment of goods. Revenues are recorded net of sales incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers. Our shipping and handling costs are
classified as part of cost of sales. Provisions for product returns and other trade allowances are also recorded as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized.

Marketing and Research and Development:

We promote our products with
advertising, marketing, sales incentives and trade promotions. These programs include, but are not limited to, cooperative advertising,

in-store

displays, consumer promotions, new product introduction fees,
discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives. We expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred. Sales incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based
on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. We base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising expenses and sales incentives are charged to
operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated volume and estimated program spending. We do not defer costs on our

year-end

consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an
expense in the year incurred. Advertising expense was $1,396 million in 2016, $1,542 million in 2015 and $1,552 million in 2014. Advertising declined in 2016 due primarily to the deconsolidation of our historical global coffee
business and due to currency changes. We expense product research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expense was $376 million in 2016, $409 million in 2015 and $455 million in 2014. Our total research and
development expense was lower in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to the deconsolidation of our global coffee business in July 2015, currency and cost optimization initiatives. We record marketing and research and development expenses within selling,
general and administrative expenses.



Employee Benefit Plans:

We
provide a range of benefits to our current and retired employees. These include pension benefits, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits depending upon jurisdiction, tenure, job level and other factors. Local statutory
requirements govern many of the benefit plans we provide around the world. Local government plans generally cover health care benefits for retirees outside the United States, Canada and United Kingdom. Our U.S., Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries
provide health care and other benefits to most retired employees. Our postemployment benefit plans provide primarily severance benefits for eligible salaried and certain hourly employees. The cost for these plans is recognized in earnings primarily
over the working life of the covered employee.

Financial Instruments:

We use financial instruments to manage our currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall
risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. A principal objective of our risk
management strategies is to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates, principally through the use of derivative instruments.

We use a combination of primarily currency forward contracts, futures, options and swaps; commodity forward contracts, futures and options; and interest rate swaps to
manage our exposure to cash flow variability, protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt. See Note 8,

Financial Instruments,

for more information on the types of derivative instruments
we use.

We record derivative financial instruments on a gross basis and at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets within other current assets or other
current liabilities due to their relatively short-term duration. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the derivative instrument. Changes in the fair value of a
derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in
fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge, along with the changes in the fair value of the
related hedged asset or liability, are recorded in earnings in the same period. We use

non-U.S.

dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in

non-U.S.

operations against adverse movements in exchange rates, with currency movements related to the debt and net investment and the related deferred taxes recorded within currency translation adjustment in
accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses).

In order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative
instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. We must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives,
strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for a hedge of a forecasted transaction, the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically
identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. If it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.

When we use derivatives, we are exposed to credit and market risks. Credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its
performance obligations under the contract. We reduce our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality, investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the
financial condition of our counterparties. We also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant,

non-exchange

traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an
International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. Market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and commodity prices, currency exchange
rates or interest rates. We manage derivative market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments.

Commodity cash flow hedges

. We are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials. We enter
into commodity forward contracts primarily for wheat, sugar and other sweeteners, soybean and vegetable oils and cocoa. Commodity forward contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging
activities under the normal purchases exception. We also use commodity futures and options to hedge the price of certain input costs, including cocoa, energy costs, sugar and other sweeteners, wheat, packaging, dairy, corn, and soybean and vegetable
oils. Some of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. We also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments, and we occasionally use related futures to cross-hedge a commodity
exposure. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.



Currency exchange cash flow hedges

. We use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in
exchange rates from

third-party

and intercompany current and forecasted transactions. These instruments may include currency exchange forward contracts, futures, options and swaps. Based on the size and
location of our businesses, we use these instruments to hedge our exposure to certain currencies, including the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.

Interest rate cash flow and fair value hedges

. We manage interest rate volatility by modifying the pricing or maturity characteristics of certain liabilities so
that the net impact on expense is not, on a material basis, adversely affected by movements in interest rates. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value. We expect the effect of
this unrealized appreciation or depreciation to be substantially offset by our gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to these hedged liabilities. We use derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps that have indices
related to the pricing of specific liabilities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. As a matter of policy, we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments for interest rate risk management. We use interest rate swaps to
economically convert a portion of our fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. Under the interest rate swap contracts, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest
amounts, which is calculated based on an agreed-upon notional amount. We also use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our future debt obligations. Most recently in October 2016, we executed
cross-currency interest rate swaps that we use to hedge interest payment cash flows on newly issued debt denominated in a different currency than the functional currency of the borrowing entity. Substantially all of these derivative instruments are
highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

Hedges of net investments in

non-U.S.

operations

. We
have numerous investments outside the United States. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to changes and volatility in currency exchange rates. We use local currency denominated debt to hedge our

non-U.S.

net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates. We designated our euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc denominated borrowings as a net investment hedge of a portion of our overall
European operations. The gains and losses on our net investment in these designated European operations are economically offset by losses and gains on our euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc denominated borrowings. The change in the debt’s
value, net of deferred taxes, is recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses).

Income Taxes:

Our provision for income taxes includes amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred tax and impacts from uncertain tax positions.
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of our assets and liabilities, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse.

The realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the
carryforward periods. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider
any carryback potential, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences (including liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits), future taxable income and tax planning strategies.

We recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the
taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related
to the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions could affect income in the period when the change occurs.

New Accounting Pronouncements:

In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) that clarifies the definition of a
business with the objective of adding guidance to assist companies with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business may affect many areas of accounting
including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill and consolidation. The ASU is applied on a prospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the ASU and
potential prospective impact on our consolidated financial statements.



In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that requires the change in restricted cash or cash equivalents to be included
with other changes in cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We anticipate adopting this standard at the same time as the
cash flow statement classification changes described below go into effect on January 1, 2018. We are currently assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to amend the consolidation guidance on the treatment of indirect interests held through related parties that are under common
control. Under the amendments, a single decision maker is required to include those interests on a proportionate basis consistent with indirect interests held through other related parties

.

The ASU is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new standard on December 31, 2016 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that requires the recognition of tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers other than inventory when the transfer occurs
and removes the exception to postpone recognition until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We anticipate adopting on
January 1, 2018 and do not expect the ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to
provide guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues and reduce diversity in practice in how some cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We anticipate adopting this standard on January 1, 2018. We are currently assessing the impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify the accounting for stock-based compensation. The ASU addresses several areas of accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and cash flow statement presentation. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption
permitted. We will adopt the standard on January 1, 2017. Following adoption and on a prospective basis, we anticipate greater volatility in our consolidated statements of earnings as we will record certain stock-based compensation tax impacts
in earnings (within the provision for income taxes) while under the former guidance and for periods prior to January 1, 2017, the tax impacts were recorded directly to equity (within additional

paid-in

capital).

In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that simplifies the transition accounting for increases in investments that require a change from the cost basis to
the equity method of accounting. U.S. GAAP currently requires the impact of such changes in accounting method to be retroactively applied to all prior periods that the investment was held. Under the new standard, adjustments to the investor’s
basis in the investment should be recorded on the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The equity method of accounting is then applied prospectively from that date. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted this standard on December 31, 2016 and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that clarifies whether contingent put and call options meet the “clearly and closely related” criteria in connection
with accounting for embedded derivatives. U.S GAAP requires that embedded derivatives be separated from the host contract and accounted for separately as derivatives if certain criteria are met. The criteria include determining that the economic
characteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives are not “clearly and closely related” to those of the host contract. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We
adopted the new standard on December 31, 2016 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued
an ASU that applies when there is a contract novation to a new counterparty for a derivative designated as an accounting hedge. The ASU clarifies that such a change in counterparty does not, in and of itself, require

de-designation

of the hedging relationship, provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early
adoption permitted. We adopted the new standard on December 31, 2016 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU on lease accounting. The ASU revises existing U.S. GAAP and outlines a new model for lessors and lessees to use in accounting for lease contracts. The guidance requires lessees to recognize a

right-of-use

asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. In the consolidated statement of earnings, lessees will
classify leases as either operating (resulting in straight-line expense) or financing (resulting in a front-loaded expense pattern). The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We
anticipate adopting the new standard on January 1, 2019. We have made progress in our due diligence and continue to assess the impact of the new standard across our operations and on our consolidated financial statements.



In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that provides updated guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation and
disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. The standard requires that equity investments (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) be measured at fair value, with
changes in fair value recognized in net income. The standard also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017. This ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU
on revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The ASU outlines a new, single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control
over promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount,
timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from customer contracts, including significant judgments made in recognizing revenue. In 2016, the FASB issued several ASUs that clarified principal versus agent (gross versus net) revenue
presentation considerations, confirmed certain prepaid stored-value products should be accounted for under the new revenue recognition ASU and not under other U.S. GAAP and clarified the guidance for identifying performance obligations within a
contract and the accounting for licenses. The FASB also issued two ASUs providing technical corrections, narrow scope exceptions and practical expedients to clarify and improve the implementation of the new revenue recognition guidance. The revenue
guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date (annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016). The ASU may be applied
retrospectively to historical periods presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We plan to adopt the new standard on January 1, 2018 on a full retrospective basis. We continue to make significant progress on
quantifying the impact of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements and planning the final process, policy and disclosure changes that will go into effect on January 1, 2018. At this time, we do not expect a material impact from adopting
the new revenue standards.

Reclassifications:

Note 2. Divestitures and Acquisitions

JDE Coffee Business Transactions:

On July 2, 2015, we completed transactions to combine our wholly owned coffee businesses with those of D.E Master Blenders 1753 B.V. (“DEMB”) to
create a new company, JDE. Following the exchange of a portion of our investment in JDE for an interest in Keurig in March 2016, we held a 26.5% equity interest in JDE. (See discussion of the

Keurig Transaction

below.) The remaining 73.5%
equity interest in JDE was held by a subsidiary of Acorn Holdings B.V. (“AHBV,” owner of DEMB prior to July 2, 2015). Following the transactions discussed under

JDE Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements

below, as of
December 31, 2016, we hold a 26.4% equity interest in JDE.

The consideration we received in the JDE coffee business transactions completed on July 2,
2015 consisted of

€

3.8 billion of cash ($4.2 billion as of July 2, 2015), a 43.5% equity interest in JDE (prior to the decrease in ownership due to the Keurig transaction and the
compensation arrangements

discussed below

)

and $794 million in receivables (related to sales price adjustments and tax formation cost payments). During the third quarter of 2015, we also recorded $283 million of cash and
receivables from JDE related to reimbursement of costs that we incurred in separating our coffee businesses. The cash and equity consideration we received at closing reflects our retaining our interest in our Korea-based joint venture, DSF. During
the second quarter of 2015, we also completed the sale of our interest in a Japanese coffee joint venture, Ajinomoto General Foods, Inc. (“AGF”). In lieu of contributing our interest in the AGF joint venture to JDE, we contributed the net
cash proceeds from this sale as part of the overall JDE coffee business transactions. See

Other Divestitures and Acquisitions

for a discussion of the AGF divestiture.



On July 5, 2016, we received an expected cash payment of $275 million from JDE to settle the receivable related
to tax formation costs that were part of the initial sales price.

In connection with the contribution of our global coffee businesses to JDE on July 2, 2015,
we recorded a final

pre-tax

gain of $6.8 billion (or $6.6 billion

after-tax)

in 2015 after final adjustments described below. As previously reported, we
deconsolidated net assets totaling $2.9 billion and reduced accumulated other comprehensive losses for the transfer of coffee business-related pension obligations by $90 million. We also recorded approximately $1.0 billion of

pre-tax

net gains related to hedging the expected cash proceeds from the transactions as described further below. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we and JDE concluded negotiations of a sales price adjustment and
completed the valuation of our investment in JDE. Primarily due to the negotiated resolution of the sales price adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $313 million reduction in the

pre-tax

gain on the coffee transaction, reducing the $7.1 billion estimated gain in the third quarter of 2015 to the $6.8 billion final gain for 2015. As part of our sales price negotiations, we
retained the right to collect future cash payments if certain estimated pension liabilities are realized over an agreed amount in the future. As such, we may recognize additional income related to this negotiated term in the future.

The final value of our 43.5% investment in JDE on July 2, 2015 was

€

4.1 billion ($4.5 billion as of
July 2, 2015). The fair value of the JDE investment was determined using both income-based and market-based valuation techniques. The discounted cash flow analysis reflected growth, discount and tax rates and other assumptions reflecting the
underlying combined businesses and countries in which the combined coffee businesses operate. The fair value of the JDE investment also included the fair values of the

Carte Noire

and

Merrild

businesses, which JDE agreed to divest to
comply with the conditioned approval by the European Commission related to the JDE coffee business transactions. As of the end of the first quarter of 2016, these businesses were sold by JDE. As the July 2, 2015 fair values for these businesses
were recorded by JDE at their pending sales values, we did not record any gain or loss on the sales of these businesses in our share of JDE’s earnings.

In
2014 and 2015, in connection with the expected receipt of cash in euros at the time of closing, we entered into a number of consecutive currency exchange forward contracts to lock in an equivalent expected value in U.S. dollars as of the date the
JDE coffee business transactions were first announced in May 2014. Cumulatively, we realized aggregate net gains and received cash of approximately $1.0 billion on these hedging contracts that increased the cash we received in connection with
the JDE coffee business transactions from $4.2 billion in cash consideration received to $5.2 billion. In connection with these currency contracts and the transfer of the sale proceeds to our subsidiaries that deconsolidated net assets and
shares, we recognized a net gain of $436 million in 2015 and $628 million in 2014 within interest and other expense, net.

We also incurred incremental
expenses related to readying our global coffee businesses for the transactions that totaled $278 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $77 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of these total expenses,
$123 million was recorded within asset impairment and exit costs in 2015 and the remainder was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses of primarily our Europe segment, as well as within general corporate expenses.

JDE Capital Increase:

On December 18, 2015, AHBV and we agreed to
provide JDE additional capital to pay down some of its debt with lenders. Our pro rata share of the capital increase was

€

499 million ($544 million as of December 18, 2015) and was
made in return for a pro rata number of additional shares in JDE such that our ownership in JDE did not change following the capital increase. To fund our share of the capital increase, we contributed

€

460 million ($501 million) of JDE receivables and made a

€

39 million ($43 million) cash payment.

JDE Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements:

On June 30, 2016, we entered
into agreements with AHBV and its affiliates to establish a new stock-based compensation arrangement tied to the issuance of JDE equity compensation awards to JDE employees. This arrangement replaced a temporary equity compensation program tied to
the issuance of AHBV equity compensation to JDE employees. New Class C, D and E JDE shares were authorized and issued for investments made by and vested stock-based compensation awards granted to JDE employees. Under these arrangements,
dilution of the JDE shares is limited to 2%. Upon execution of the agreements and the creation of the Class C, D and E JDE shares, as a percentage of the total JDE issued shares, our Class B shares decreased from 26.5% to 26.4% and
AHBV’s Class A shares decreased from 73.5% to 73.22%, while the Class C, D and E shares, held by AHBV and its affiliates until the JDE employee awards vest, comprised 0.38% of JDE’s shares. Additional Class C shares are
available to be issued when planned long-term incentive plan (“JDE LTIP”) awards vest, generally over the next five years. When the JDE Class C shares are issued in connection with the vested JDE LTIP awards, the Class A and B
relative ownership interests will decrease. Based on estimated achievement and forfeiture assumptions, we do not expect our JDE ownership interest to decrease below 26.27%. Following vesting of stock awards and new employee stock investments, as of
December 31, 2016, our ownership interest in JDE was 26.4%.



JDE Tax Matter Resolution:

On
July 19, 2016, the Supreme Court of Spain reached a final resolution on a challenged JDE tax position held by a predecessor DEMB company that resulted in an unfavorable tax expense of

€

114 million. As a result, our share of JDE’s equity earnings during the third quarter of 2016 was negatively affected by

€

30 million ($34 million).

Keurig Transaction:

On March 3, 2016, a subsidiary of AHBV completed a $13.9 billion acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of Keurig through a merger transaction. On
March 7, 2016, we exchanged with a subsidiary of AHBV a portion of our equity interest in JDE with a carrying value of

€

1.7 billion (approximately $2.0 billion as of March 7,
2016) for an interest in Keurig with a fair value of $2.0 billion based on the merger consideration per share for Keurig. We recorded the difference between the fair value of Keurig and our basis in JDE shares as a $43 million gain on the
equity method investment exchange in March 2016. Immediately following the exchange, our ownership interest in JDE was 26.5% and our interest in Keurig was 24.2%. Both AHBV and we hold our investments in Keurig through a combination of equity and
interests in a shareholder loan, with

pro-rata

ownership of each. Our initial $2.0 billion investment in Keurig includes a $1.6 billion Keurig equity interest and a $0.4 billion shareholder loan
receivable, which are reported on a combined basis within equity method investments on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. The shareholder loan has a 5.5% interest rate and is payable at the end of a seven-year term on
February 27, 2023. Within equity method investment net earnings, we recorded equity earnings of $77 million and interest income from the shareholder loan of $20 million in 2016. Additionally, we received $14 million of interest
payments on the shareholder loan and $4 million in dividends on our investment in Keurig for the year ended December 31, 2016. We continue to account for our investments in JDE and Keurig under the equity method and recognize our share of
their earnings within equity method investment earnings and our share of their dividends within our cash flows. As of December 31, 2016, Keurig reflected a preliminary acquisition purchase price allocation and related remeasurement updates that
we have recorded in our fourth quarter 2016 results. We anticipate the purchase price allocation work will be finalized in the first quarter of 2017.

Coffee
Business Equity Earnings:

We have reflected the results of our historical coffee businesses and equity earnings from JDE, Keurig and DSF in our results from
continuing operations as the coffee category continues to be a significant part of our net earnings and business strategy going forward. Historically, our coffee businesses and the income from equity method investments were recorded within our
operating income as these businesses were part of our base business. While we retain an ongoing interest in coffee through equity method investments including JDE, Keurig and DSF, and we have significant influence with our equity method investments,
we do not control these operations directly. As such, in the third quarter of 2015, we began to recognize equity method investment earnings, consisting primarily of investments in coffee businesses, outside of operating income. For periods prior to
the third quarter of 2015, our historical coffee business and equity method investment earnings were included within our operating income.

Of the $301 million
equity method investment net earnings in 2016, the contribution from JDE was $100 million, from Keurig was $97 million (since March 7, 2016), from DSF was $75 million and from all other equity investments was $29 million. In
2015, JDE incurred a $58 million loss, which was fully offset by earnings of $38 million from DSF and $21 million from other equity method investments. Within operating income for the first half of 2015, $296 million

after-tax

($342 million

pre-tax)

earnings related to our legacy coffee business, $40 million was from DSF and $16 million was from our other equity method
investments. In 2014, $572 million ($646 million

pre-tax)

earnings related to our legacy coffee business, $83 million was from DSF and $30 million was from our other equity method
investments.

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with
the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in

after-tax

equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. For the six months ended
December 31, 2015,

after-tax

equity method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis. Earnings from equity method investments recorded within segment operating income were
$56 million for the six months ended July 2, 2015 and $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Principles of Consolidation,

for additional
information.

Spin-Off

of Kraft Foods Group:

On October 1, 2012, we divested the Kraft Foods Group grocery business in a

spin-off

(“Spin-Off”).

In 2014, we concluded our

Spin-Off-related

transition plans and recorded final

Spin-Off

transaction, transition and financing and related costs

(“Spin-Off

Costs”) of $35 million in 2014 in

pre-tax

earnings within selling, general and administrative expenses.

Other Divestitures and Acquisitions:

On January 18, 2017, we reached an agreement to sell most of our grocery business in Australia and New Zealand to Bega Cheese Limited for approximately
$460 million Australian dollars ($346 million as of January 18, 2017). As of December 31, 2016, the asset group to be sold consisted of approximately $25 million of current assets and approximately $125 million of

non-current

assets based on the December 31, 2016

Australian-to-U.S.

dollar exchange rate. We expect the transaction to close in
2017.



On March 31, 2016, we received a binding offer totaling

€

176 million ($185 million as of December 31, 2016) for the sale of several manufacturing facilities in France and the sale or license of several local confectionery brands. Taking
into account agreed upon sales price adjustments related to cash, employee-related liabilities and working capital to be transferred at closing, we currently estimate a sales price of

€

225 million ($237 million as of December 31, 2016) based on net book values as of December 31, 2016. The final sales price is subject to change as working capital and other
account balances may change at the time of closing. The transactions are subject to E.U. and local regulatory approvals, completion of employee consultation requirements and additional steps to prepare the assets for transfer. During the fourth
quarter, we received the Works Council approval and the buyer obtained anti-trust clearance in all markets where it was required. As of December 31, 2016, the held for sale assets and liabilities consisted of $125 million of current
assets, $174 million of

non-current

assets, $33 million of current liabilities and $29 million of

non-current

liabilities based on the
December 31, 2016

euro-to-U.S.

dollar exchange rate. On March 31, 2016, we recorded a $14 million impairment charge for a gum & candy trademark
as a portion of its carrying value would not be recoverable based on future cash flows expected under a planned license agreement with the buyer. In May 2016, we recorded an additional $5 million impairment charge for another candy trademark to
reduce the overall net assets to the estimated net sales proceeds after transaction costs. Additionally, in 2016, we incurred and accrued $86 million of incremental expenses to ready the business for the sale transactions expected to close in
2017. We recorded these costs within cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses of our Europe segment.

During the year ended December 31,
2016, we also completed the following sale transactions:

•

On December 31, 2016, we completed the sale of a chocolate factory in Belgium. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a

pre-tax

loss of

€

65 million ($68 million as of December 31, 2016), within asset impairment and exit costs in our Europe segment. The loss includes a fixed asset impairment charge of

€

30 million ($31 million as of December 31, 2016), a loss on disposal of

€

22 million ($23 million as of December 31,
2016) and incremental expenses we incurred and accrued of

€

13 million ($14 million as of December 31, 2016) related to selling the factory.

•

On December 1, 2016, we completed the sale of a confectionery business in Costa Rica represented by a local brand. The sales price was $28 million and we recorded a

pre-tax

gain of $9 million within gains on divestiture within our Latin America segment. We divested approximately $11 million of property, plant and equipment, $4 million of goodwill and
$2 million of inventory. In connection with this transaction, we incurred $2 million of transaction costs and accrued expenses.

•

On August 26, 2016, we recorded a $7 million gain for the sale of a U.S.-owned biscuit trademark. The gain was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016.

•

On May 2, 2016, we completed the sale of certain local biscuit brands in Finland as part of our strategic decisions to exit select small and local brands and shift investment towards our Power Brands. The sales
price was

€

14 million ($16 million as of May 2, 2016) and we recorded a

pre-tax

gain of $6 million ($5 million

after-tax)

within selling, general and administrative expenses of our Europe segment in the year ended December 31, 2016. We divested $8 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets and less than
$1 million of other assets. We received cash proceeds of

€

12 million ($14 million as of May 2, 2016) upon closing and another

€

2 million ($2 million as of October 31, 2016) of consideration following the completion of post-closing requirements. The additional $2 million of consideration increased the

pre-tax

gain to $8 million ($6 million

after-tax)

through December 31, 2016.

On November 2, 2016, we purchased from Burton’s Biscuit Company certain intangibles, which include the license to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded
biscuits in additional key markets around the world, including in the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, North America and Saudi Arabia. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Total cash paid for the acquired assets was
£199 million ($246 million as of December 31, 2016). We are working to complete the valuation work and have recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation of $72 million to definite-life intangible assets,
$156 million to goodwill, $14 million to property, plant and equipment and $4 million to inventory as of December 31, 2016.



During the third quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisition of a Vietnamese biscuit operation within our AMEA segment.
On July 15, 2015, we acquired an 80% interest in the biscuit operation and on August 22, 2016, we acquired the remaining 20% interest. Total cash paid for the biscuit operation, intellectual property,

non-compete

and consulting agreements less purchase price adjustments was 12,404 billion Vietnamese dong ($569 million using applicable exchange rates on July 15, 2015, November 27, 2015
and August 22, 2016). On August 22, 2016, in connection with acquiring the remaining 20% interest in the biscuit operation, we released escrowed funds of $70 million and retained an agreed $20 million related to two
outstanding acquisition-related matters that are expected to be resolved in 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we released an additional $5 million of the escrowed funds and are holding $15 million until the outstanding acquisition
matters are resolved. On August 22, 2016, we also made a final payment of 759 billion Vietnamese dong ($35 million as of August 22, 2016) for the

non-compete

and consulting agreements. The

non-compete

and consulting agreements were recorded as prepaid contracts within other current and

non-current

assets and will be amortized into net earnings over the term of
the agreements. During the third quarter of 2016, we also finalized the valuation and purchase price allocation of the acquired net assets of the business, which included $10 million of inventory, $49 million of property, plant and
equipment, $86 million of intangible assets, $385 million of goodwill and $31 million of other net liabilities. In periods following the initial July 15, 2015 first closing date, the allocation of the net asset fair values had an
immaterial impact on our operating results. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of $71 million in 2016 and $121 million in 2015 and added incremental operating income of $5 million in 2016 and $21 million in 2015.
Within selling, general and administrative expenses, we recorded integration costs of $7 million in 2016 and $9 million in 2015 and acquisition costs of $7 million in 2015 and $2 million in 2014.

On April 23, 2015, we completed the divestiture of our 50% equity interest in AGF, our Japanese coffee joint venture, to our joint venture partner, which generated
cash proceeds of 27 billion Japanese yen ($225 million as of April 23, 2015) and a

pre-tax

gain of $13 million

(after-tax

loss of $9 million) in the
second quarter of 2015. Upon closing, we divested our $99 million investment in the joint venture, $65 million of goodwill and $41 million of accumulated other comprehensive losses. We also incurred approximately $7 million of
transaction costs in 2015.

On February 16, 2015, we acquired a U.S. snack food company, Enjoy Life Foods, within our North America segment. We paid cash and
settled debt totaling $81 million in connection with the acquisition. Upon finalizing the valuation of the acquired net assets during the second quarter of 2015, we recorded an $81 million purchase price allocation of $58 million in
identifiable intangible assets, $20 million of goodwill and $3 million of other net assets. The acquisition-related costs and operating results of the acquisition were not material to our consolidated financial statements for the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Sales of Property:

On
November 9, 2016, we completed the sale of a manufacturing plant in Russia and recorded total expenses of $12 million, including a related fixed asset impairment charge of $4 million within asset impairments and exit costs. The sale
of the land, buildings and equipment generated cash proceeds of $6 million.

In 2016, we also sold property within our North America segment and from our
centrally held corporate assets. In the third quarter, we sold property in North America that generated cash proceeds of $10 million and a

pre-tax

gain of $6 million and we sold a corporate aircraft
hangar that generated cash proceeds of $3 million and a

pre-tax

gain of $1 million. In the second quarter, we also sold separate property in North America that generated cash proceeds of
$40 million and a

pre-tax

gain of $33 million and we sold a corporate aircraft that generated cash proceeds of $20 million and a

pre-tax

gain of
$6 million. The gains were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses and cash proceeds were recorded in cash flows from other investing activities in year ended December 31, 2016.

non-compete

agreements. At December 31, 2016, the weighted-average life of our amortizable intangible assets was 13.5 years.

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $176 million in 2016, $181 million in 2015 and $206 million in 2014. We currently estimate annual
amortization expense for each of the next five years to be approximately $171 million, estimated using December 31, 2016 exchange rates.

Changes to goodwill and intangibles were:

•

Coffee business transactions and divestitures – On December 1, 2016, we divested $4 million of goodwill related to the sale of a confectionery business in Costa Rica. On May 2, 2016, we sold
$8 million of

non-amortizable

intangible assets in Finland. On July 2, 2015, we deconsolidated $1,664 million of goodwill and less than $1 million of intangible assets in connection with
the coffee business transactions. On April 23, 2015, we completed the divestiture of our 50% equity interest in AGF, which resulted in divesting $65 million of goodwill. See Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions

, for additional
information on these transactions.

•

Acquisitions – On November 2, 2016, we purchased from Burton’s Biscuit Company certain intangibles, which include a license to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits in additional key
markets. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation of $156 million to goodwill and $72 million to amortizable intangible assets. In connection with the completion of the Vietnam biscuit operation
in 2016, we finalized the purchase price allocation of the consideration paid to the net assets acquired and recorded $25 million of amortizable intangible assets and $61 million of

non-amortizable

intangible assets related to acquired trademarks and customer-related intangible assets. A preliminary goodwill balance was recorded in the third quarter of 2015 and subsequently adjusted by $76 million to $385 million during the first
nine months of 2016 to reflect finalized intangible asset and other asset fair valuations. On February 16, 2015, we also acquired Enjoy Life Foods and recorded $20 million of goodwill and $58 million in identifiable intangible assets.
See Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions – Other Divestitures and Acquisitions

, for additional information.

•

Asset impairments – We recorded $137 million of intangible asset impairments in 2016, $83 million in 2015 and $57 million in 2014. Charges related to our annual testing of

non-amortizable

intangible assets are described further below. Additionally, during 2016, $20 million of impairments recorded in our Europe segment related to the planned sale of a confectionery business in
France (see Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions – Other Divestitures and Acquisitions

, for additional information). In 2016, we also recorded $19 million of charges in our Europe, North America and AMEA segments resulting from the
discontinuation of four biscuit products and one candy product. Additionally, in 2015, in connection with the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations on December 31, 2015, we recorded $12 million of impairment charges within the loss
on deconsolidation of Venezuela related to a biscuit trademark.



In 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2016 annual impairment testing, each
of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our
control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.

During our 2016 annual testing of

non-amortizable

intangible assets, we recorded $98 million of impairment charges related
to five trademarks. The impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth in part driven by decisions to redirect support from these trademarks to other regional and global brands, as well as slowdowns in local economies. We recorded
charges related to biscuits, candy and gum trademarks of $41 million in AMEA, $32 million in North America, $22 million in Europe, and $3 million in Latin America. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the
carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. We primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method, which utilizes estimates of future sales,
growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value. During our 2016 intangible asset impairment review, we noted nine brands, including the five impaired trademarks, with $630 million of
aggregate book value as of December 31, 2016 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. While the other four intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and we believe our current plans for each of these
brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired, if the product line expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in
the future. In 2015, we recorded a $44 million charge related to candy and biscuit trademarks in our AMEA segment, $22 million in Europe and $5 million in Latin America. In 2014, we recorded a $48 million charge related to a
biscuit trademark in our AMEA segment and a $9 million charge related to a candy trademark in our Europe segment.

Note 6. Restructuring Programs

On May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a $3.5 billion restructuring program, comprised of approximately $2.5 billion in cash costs and
$1 billion in

non-cash

costs (the “2014-2018 Restructuring Program”) and up to $2.2 billion of capital expenditures. On August 31, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a reallocation
within the $5.7 billion total cost of the programs of $600 million of previously approved capital expenditures to be spent on restructuring program cash costs. There was no change to the total $5.7 billion cost of the programs and no
change to the total $4.7 billion of cash outlays. The $5.7 billion total cost of the programs is now comprised of approximately $4.1 billion of restructuring program costs ($3.1 billion cash costs and $1 billion non-cash costs)
and up to $1.6 billion of capital expenditures. The primary objective of the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program is to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. The program is intended primarily to cover
severance as well as asset disposals and other manufacturing-related

one-time

costs. Since inception, we have incurred total restructuring and related implementation charges of $2.5 billion related to the
2014-2018 Restructuring Program. We have incurred the majority of the program’s charges through 2016 and we expect to complete the program by

year-end

2018.

Restructuring Costs:

We recorded restructuring charges of $714 million
in 2016, $711 million 2015 and $274 million in 2014 within asset impairment and exit costs. The 2014-2018 Restructuring Program liability activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was:

Severance

We spent $315 million in 2016 and $243 million in 2015 in cash severance and related costs. We also recognized

non-cash

pension settlement losses (See Note 9,

Benefit Plans

),

non-cash

asset write-downs (including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments) and other

non-cash

adjustments totaling $321 million in 2016 and $273 million in 2015. At December 31, 2016, $379 million of our net restructuring liability was recorded within other current liabilities
and $85 million was recorded within other long-term liabilities.

Implementation Costs:

Implementation costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities.
We believe the disclosure of implementation costs provides readers of our financial statements with more information on the total costs of our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. Implementation costs primarily relate to reorganizing our operations and
facilities in connection with our supply chain reinvention program and other identified productivity and cost saving initiatives. The costs include incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities, costs to terminate certain contracts and
the simplification of our information systems. Within our continuing results of operations, we recorded implementation costs of $372 million in 2016, $291 million in 2015 and $107 million in 2014. We recorded these costs within cost
of sales and general corporate expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.

Restructuring and Implementation Costs in Operating Income:

During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded restructuring and implementation costs related to the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program within operating income by segment (as

2012-2014 Restructuring Program

On October 1, 2012, we completed the

Spin-Off

of our North American grocery business, Kraft Foods Group, to our
shareholders. Prior to this transaction, in 2012, our Board of Directors approved $1.5 billion of restructuring and related implementation costs (the “2012-2014 Restructuring Program”) reflecting primarily severance, asset disposals
and other manufacturing-related

one-time

costs. The primary objective of the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program was to ensure that Mondelēz International and Kraft Foods Group were each set up to operate
efficiently and execute on our respective business strategies upon separation and in the future.

Of the $1.5 billion of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs,
we retained approximately $925 million and Kraft Foods Group retained the balance of the program. Through the end of 2014, we incurred total restructuring and related implementation charges of $899 million and completed incurring planned
charges on the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program.

Restructuring Costs:

We
recorded reversals to the restructuring charges of $4 million in 2015 related to accruals no longer required. We recorded restructuring charges of $360 million in 2014 within asset impairment and exit costs. During 2014, we recorded

out-of-period

accruals for $73 million of severance ($52 million related to 2014 and $21 million related to 2013) in connection with a change in the timing of
accruals for ongoing negotiations with workers’ councils and labor unions.

The 2012-2014 Restructuring Program liability activity for the years ended

We spent $21 million in 2016 and $66 million in 2015 in cash severance and related costs. We also recognized

non-cash

pension plan settlement losses (See Note 9,

) and

non-cash

adjustments totaling $6 million in 2016 and $4 million in 2015. At
December 31, 2016, $18 million of our net restructuring liability was recorded within other current liabilities and less than $1 million was recorded within other long-term liabilities.

Implementation Costs:

Implementation costs related to our 2012-2014
Restructuring Program primarily relate to activities in connection with the Kraft Foods Group

Spin-Off

such as reorganizing our operations and facilities, the discontinuance of certain product lines and
incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities, replicating our information systems infrastructure and reorganizing our sales function. Within our continuing results of operations, we recorded implementation costs of $99 million in
2014. We recorded these costs within cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.

As of December 31, 2016, the commercial paper issued and outstanding had between 3 and 88 days remaining to maturity. Bank
loans include borrowings on primarily uncommitted credit lines maintained by some of our international subsidiaries to meet short-term working capital needs.

Borrowing Arrangements:

We maintain a $4.5 billion multi-year senior
unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs, and to support our commercial paper program. On October 14, 2016, the revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to expire on
October 11, 2018, was extended through October 11, 2021. The revolving credit agreement includes a covenant that we maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity of at least $24.6 billion, excluding accumulated other comprehensive
earnings / (losses) and the cumulative effects of any changes in accounting principles. At December 31, 2016, we complied with this covenant as our shareholders’ equity, as defined by the covenant, was $36.3 billion. The revolving
credit facility agreement also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. There are no credit rating triggers, provisions or other financial covenants that could require us to post collateral as security. As of
December 31, 2016, no amounts were drawn on the facility.

Some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet
short-term working capital needs. Collectively, these credit lines amounted to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2016 and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2015. Borrowings on these lines amounted to $160 million at December 31,
2016 and $236 million at December 31, 2015.

On December 16, 2016, we redeemed $850 million of 2.250% fixed rate notes, maturing on February 1, 2019, that were
issued on January 16, 2014. The notes were redeemed at a redemption cost equal to $866 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $7 million. In connection with this redemption, during the three months ended December 31, 2016,
we recorded a $19 million loss on debt extinguishment within interest and other expense, net.

On October 31, 2016, we completed a cash tender offer and
retired $3.18 billion of U.S. dollar, euro and British pound sterling-denominated notes. We financed the repurchase of the notes, including the payment of accrued interest and other costs incurred, from net proceeds received on October 28,
2016 from the $3.75 billion note issuance and the term loans described below. In connection with retiring this debt, during the three months ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $409 million loss on debt extinguishment within
interest expense related to the amount we paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized premiums and deferred financing costs in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment. Cash costs related to
tendering the debt are included in long-term debt repayments in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016. We also recognized $1 million in interest income related to the partial settlement of fair value
hedges due to the tender.

On October 19, 2016, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Mondelēz
International, Inc., launched an offering of $3.75 billion of notes, guaranteed by Mondelēz International, Inc. The $1.75 billion of 1.625% notes and the $500 million of floating rate notes will mature on October 28, 2019
and the $1.5 billion of 2.0% notes will mature on October 28, 2021. On October 28, 2016, we received proceeds, net of discounts and associated financing costs, of $3.73 billion. Proceeds from the notes issuance were used for
general corporate purposes, including to grant loans or make distributions to Mondelēz International, Inc. or its subsidiaries to fund the October 2016 cash tender offer and near-term debt maturities. We recorded approximately $20 million
of deferred financing costs and discounts, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes. We entered into cross-currency swaps, serving as cash flow hedges, so that the U.S. dollar-denominated debt payments will
effectively be paid in euros over the life of the debt.



On October 14, 2016, MIHN executed a $1.5 billion bank term loan facility. The loan facility consists of two
$750 million loans, one with a three-year maturity and the other with a five-year maturity. The term loans can be drawn at any time for 60 days after signing. On October 25, 2016, we gave notice of our intent to fully draw on the loan with
a five-year maturity, and funding occurred on October 28, 2016. Proceeds from the $750 million term loan may be used for general corporate purposes, including funding of the tender offer or other debt. On October 25, 2016, we also
gave notice of our intent to terminate the $750 million loan with the three-year maturity.

On February 9, 2016, $1,750 million of our 4.125% U.S.
dollar notes matured. The notes and accrued interest to date were paid with net proceeds from the

fr

€

700 million euro-denominated notes issued on January 21, 2016, as well as cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper. As we refinanced $1,150 million of the matured notes
with net proceeds from the long-term debt issued in January 2016, we reflected this amount within long-term debt as of December 31, 2015.

On January 26,
2016, we issued

fr

.400 million of Swiss franc-denominated notes, or $399 million in U.S. dollars locked in with a forward currency contract on January 12, 2016, consisting of:

We received
proceeds, net of premiums and deferred financing costs, of $398 million that were used to partially fund the February 2016 note maturity and for other general corporate purposes. We recorded approximately $1 million of premiums and
deferred financing costs, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the notes.

completed a cash tender offer and retired £247 million of British pound sterling-denominated 7.250% notes, or approximately $372 million in U.S. dollars as of November 30, 2015, due in July 2018. We financed the repurchase of
these notes, including the payment of accrued interest and other costs incurred, from net proceeds received from the £400 million British pound sterling-denominated notes issuance on November 25, 2015 described below. In connection
with retiring this debt, during the three months ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $40 million loss on extinguishment of debt within interest expense related to the amount we paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and
from recognizing unamortized premiums and deferred financing costs in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment. Cash costs related to tendering the debt are included in long-term debt repayments in the consolidated statement of cash flows for
the year ended December 31, 2015.

•

$69 million of our 6.875% Notes due in January 2039

We financed the repurchase of these notes, including the
payment of accrued interest and other costs incurred, from net proceeds received from the $2.8 billion notes issuance on March 6, 2015 described below and the issuance of commercial paper. In connection with retiring this debt, during the
first three months of 2015, we recorded a $708 million loss on extinguishment of debt within interest expense related to the amount we paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized discounts and
deferred financing costs in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment. Cash costs related to tendering the debt are included in long-term debt repayments in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015. We
also recognized $5 million of charges within interest expense from hedging instruments related to the retired debt. Upon extinguishing the debt, the deferred cash flow hedge amounts were recorded in earnings.

On March 6, 2015, we issued

€

2.0 billion of euro-denominated notes and £450 million of
British pound sterling-denominated notes, or approximately $2.8 billion in U.S. dollars as of March 31, 2015, consisting of:

•

£450 million (or $667 million) of 3.875% fixed rate notes that mature on March 6, 2045

We received net
proceeds of $2,890 million that were used to fund the March 2015 tender offer and for other general corporate purposes. We recorded approximately $29 million of discounts and deferred financing costs, which will be amortized into interest
expense over the life of the notes.

Our weighted-average interest rate on our total debt was 2.2% as of December 31, 2016, 3.7% as of December 31, 2015
and 4.3% as of December 31, 2014.

Fair Value of Our Debt:

The fair
value of our short-term borrowings at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 reflects current market interest rates and approximates the amounts we have recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of our long-term debt was
determined using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 valuation data) for the publicly traded debt obligations. At December 31, 2016, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $17,882 million and its carrying value was
$17,199 million. At December 31, 2015, the aggregate fair value of our total debt was $15,908 million and its carrying value was $15,398 million.

these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges. Our exchange-traded derivatives are generally subject to master netting arrangements that permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty when
certain criteria are met, such as in the event of default. We also are required to maintain cash margin accounts in connection with funding the settlement of our open positions, and the margin requirements generally fluctuate daily based on market
conditions. We have recorded margin deposits related to our exchange-traded derivatives of $133 million as of December 31, 2016 and margin deposits of $22 million as of December 31, 2015 within other current assets. Based on our
net asset or liability positions with individual counterparties, in the event of default and immediate net settlement of all of our open positions, for derivatives we have in a net asset position, our counterparties would owe us a total of
$48 million as of December 31, 2016 and $52 million as of December 31, 2015. For derivatives we have in a net liability position, we would owe $2 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, there were
no Level 1 derivatives in a net liability position.

Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of

over-the-counter

(“OTC”) currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach
based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by
the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the
contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed
by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our commodity and currency exchange OTC derivatives do
not have a legal right of

set-off.

In connection with our OTC derivatives that could be

net-settled

in the event of default, assuming all parties were to fail to comply
with the terms of the agreements, for derivatives we have in a net liability position, we would owe $40 million as of December 31, 2016 and $101 million as of December 31, 2015, and for derivatives we have in a net asset
position, our counterparties would owe us a total of $162 million as of December 31, 2016 and $64 million as of December 31, 2015. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into
transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.

Within interest and other expense, net, we recorded

pre-tax

losses of $97 million in
the first quarter of 2016 and $34 million in the first quarter of 2015 related to amounts excluded from effectiveness testing. These amounts relate to interest rate swaps no longer designated as cash flow hedges due to changes in financing
plans. Due to lower overall costs and our decision to hedge a greater portion of our net investments in operations that use currencies other than the U.S. dollar as their functional currencies, we changed our plans to issue U.S. dollar-denominated
debt and instead issued euro and Swiss franc-denominated notes in the current year first quarter, and euro, British pound sterling and Swiss franc-denominated notes in the prior-year first quarter. Amounts excluded from effectiveness testing were
not material for the remainder of 2016 and 2015 and prior year periods.

Based on current market conditions, we would expect to transfer losses of $31 million (net of taxes) for commodity cash flow hedges, unrealized gains of
$10 million (net of taxes) for currency cash flow hedges and unrealized losses of $2 million (net of taxes) for interest rate cash flow hedges to earnings during the next 12 months.

In connection with the coffee business transactions, we entered into a number of consecutive euro to U.S. dollar currency exchange
forward contracts in 2015 and 2014 to lock in an equivalent expected value in U.S. dollars. The

mark-to-market

gains and losses on the derivatives were recorded in
earnings. We recorded net gains of $436 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $628 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 within interest and other expense, net in connection with the forward contracts and the
transferring of proceeds to our subsidiaries where coffee net assets and shares were deconsolidated. The currency hedge and related gains and losses were recorded within interest and other expense, net. See Note 2,

Note 9. Benefit Plans

Pension
Plans

Prior to the July 2, 2015 closing of the coffee business transactions, certain active employees who transitioned to JDE participated in our

Non-U.S.

pension plans. Following the transactions, benefits began to be provided directly by JDE to participants continuing with JDE. JDE assumed certain pension plan obligations and received the related plan
assets. In 2015, we reduced our net benefit plan liabilities by $131 million and the related deferred tax assets by $24 million. For participants that elected not to transfer into the JDE plans, we retained the plan obligations and related
plan assets.

The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to the measurement date, was $1,540 million at
December 31, 2016 and $1,463 million at December 31, 2015 for the U.S. pension plans. The accumulated benefit obligation for the

non-U.S.

pension plans was $9,531 million at
December 31, 2016 and $9,267 million at December 31, 2015.

For salaried and

non-union

hourly employees
hired after January 1, 2009, we discontinued benefits under our U.S. pension plans and replaced them with an enhanced Company contribution to our employee defined contribution plan. Effective December 31, 2019, benefit accruals will cease
under the U.S.

non-union

pension plan. For

non-union

employees participating in that plan on December 31, 2019, we will calculate the pension benefit obligation
based on pay and service as of that date and no longer accrue new benefits.

The combined U.S. and

non-U.S.

pension plans
resulted in a net pension liability of $1,882 million at December 31, 2016 and $2,145 million at December 31, 2015. We recognized these amounts in our consolidated balance sheets as follows:

Year-end

discount rates for our U.S., Canadian, Eurozone and U.K. plans were developed
from a model portfolio of high quality,

fixed-income

debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations.

Year-end

discount rates for our remaining

non-U.S.

plans were developed from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of
changes in bond yields

year-over-year.

We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical long-term investment performance,
current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.

At the end of 2015, we changed the approach used to measure service and interest
costs for pension benefits. For 2015, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. For 2016, we measured service and interest costs by
applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe the new approach provided a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash
flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. The impact of this change was a decrease in net periodic pension cost of approximately $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change did not affect the measurement
of our plan obligations. We accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, accounted for it on a prospective basis.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, amortization of prior service cost includes $17 million of pension curtailment losses related to employees who transitioned to JDE upon the contribution of our global
coffee business. Refer to Note 2

, Divestitures and Acquisitions – JDE Coffee Business Transactions

, for more information.

Settlement losses include $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 of pension settlement losses for employees who elected

lump-sum

payments in connection with our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. Retired employees who elected

lump-sum

payments resulted in net settlement losses in 2016 of
$15 million for our U.S. plans and $6 million for our

non-U.S.

plans and in 2015 of $10 million for our U.S. plans and $2 million for our

non-U.S.

plans. Employees who elected

lump-sum

payments in connection with our 2012-2014 Restructuring Program and cost saving initiatives and retired employees who elected

lump-sum

payments resulted in net settlement losses for our U.S. plans of $28 million in 2014. In addition, we incurred special termination benefit costs of $2 million in 2014 in the

non-U.S.

plans related to the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program. See Note 6,

Restructuring Programs

, for more information. We recorded an additional $90 million of pension settlement losses related to the
coffee business transactions within the gain on the coffee business transactions. Refer to Note 2

, Divestitures and Acquisitions – JDE Coffee Business Transactions

, for more information.

For the U.S. plans, we determine the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost using a calculated market return value that recognizes the
cost over a four year period. For our

non-U.S.

plans, we utilize a similar approach with varying cost recognition periods for some plans, and with others, we determine the expected return on plan assets based
on asset fair values as of the measurement date.

As of December 31, 2016, for the combined U.S. and

non-U.S.

pension
plans, we expected to amortize from accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) into net periodic pension cost during 2017:

•

an estimated $202 million of net loss from experience differences; and

•

$1 million of estimated prior service credit.

We excluded plan assets of $62 million at December 31, 2016 and $66 million at December 31, 2015 from
the above tables related to certain insurance contracts as they are reported at contract value, in accordance with authoritative guidance.

Fair value
measurements:

•

Level 1 – includes primarily U.S and

non-U.S.

equity securities and government bonds valued using quoted prices in active markets.

•

Level 2 – includes primarily pooled funds, including assets in real estate pooled funds, valued using net asset values of participation units held in common collective trusts, as reported by the managers of
the trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. Level 2 plan assets also include corporate bonds and other fixed-income securities, valued using independent observable market inputs, such as matrix
pricing, yield curves and indices.

•

Level 3 – includes investments valued using unobservable inputs that reflect the plans’ assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets, based on the best information available.

•

Fair value estimates for pooled funds are calculated by the investment advisor when reliable quotations or pricing services are not readily available for certain underlying securities. The estimated value is based on
either cost or last sale price for most of the securities valued in this fashion.

•

Fair value estimates for private equity investments are calculated by the general partners using the market approach to estimate the fair value of private investments. The market approach utilizes prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions, type of security, degree of liquidity, restrictions on the disposition, latest round of financing data, company financial statements, relevant valuation multiples and discounted cash flow
analyses.

•

Fair value estimates for real estate investments are calculated by the investment managers using the present value of future cash flows expected to be received from the investments, based on valuation methodologies such
as appraisals, local market conditions, and current and projected operating performance.

•

Fair value estimates for investments in hedge

fund-of-funds

are calculated by the investment managers using the net asset value per share
of the investment as reported by the money managers of the underlying funds.

•

Fair value estimates for certain fixed-income securities such as insurance contracts are calculated based on the future stream of benefit payments discounted using prevailing interest rates based on the valuation date.

•

Net asset value – primarily includes real estate funds, hedge funds and private equity investments for which net asset values are normally used.

For our U.S. plans, our investment strategy is to reduce the risk of underfunded plans in part through appropriate asset
allocation within our plan assets. We attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments. The strategy involves using indexed U.S. equity and international
equity securities and actively managed U.S. investment grade fixed-income securities (which constitute 95% or more of fixed-income securities) with smaller allocations to high yield fixed-income securities.

non-U.S.

plans, the investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset / liability profiles of the plans
in each individual country. In aggregate, the asset allocation targets of our

non-U.S.

plans are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately 34% equity securities (including investments in real estate),
approximately 64% fixed-income securities and approximately 2% other alternative securities. Our investment strategy for our largest

non-U.S.

plan, which comprises 63% of our

non-U.S.

pension assets, is designed to balance risk and return by diversifying across a wide range of return-seeking and liability matching assets, invested in a range of both active and passive mandates. We
target an allocation of approximately 24% in equity securities, 21% credit, 6% private markets, 9% other diversifying assets, and 40% liability matching assets. The strategy uses indexed global developed equities, actively managed global investment
grade and alternative credit, global private equity and real estate, other diversifying assets including hedge funds, and other liability matching assets including a

buy-in

annuity policy.

Employer Contributions:

In 2016, we contributed $378 million (of which,
$350 million was voluntarily contributed) to our U.S. pension plans and $403 million (of which, $100 million was a

non-recurring

contribution related to merging our legacy Cadbury plans in the
United Kingdom) to our

non-U.S.

pension plans. In addition, employees contributed $16 million to our

non-U.S.

plans. We make contributions to our U.S. and

non-U.S.

pension plans primarily to the extent that they are tax deductible and do not generate an excise tax liability.

In 2017,
we estimate that our pension contributions will be $13 million to our U.S. plans and $455 million to our

non-U.S.

plans based on current tax laws. Of the total 2017 pension contributions,
$250 million is expected to be non-recurring. Our actual contributions may be different due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or
interest rates.

Multiemployer Pension Plans:

In
accordance with obligations we have under collective bargaining agreements, we made contributions to multiemployer pension plans of $25 million in 2016, $31 million in 2015 and $32 million in 2014. There are risks of participating in
multiemployer pension plans that are different from single employer plans. Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops
contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan are borne by the remaining participating employers. If the Company stops participating in its multi-employer pension plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based
on its allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits of the plans, referred to as a withdrawal liability.



The only individually significant multiemployer plan we participate in as of December 31, 2016 is the Bakery and
Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund (the “Fund”). Our contributions to the Fund exceeded 5% of total contributions to the Fund for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014. Our contributions to the Fund were
$21 million in 2016, $27 million in 2015 and $25 million in 2014. Our contributions to other multiemployer pension plans that were not individually significant were $4 million in 2016, $4 million in 2015 and $7 million
in 2014. Our contributions are based on our contribution rates under our collective bargaining agreements, the number of our eligible employees and Fund surcharges.

Effective January 1, 2012, the Fund’s zone status changed to “Red”. As a result of this certification,
beginning in July 2012, we were charged a 10% surcharge on our contribution rates. The Fund subsequently adopted a rehabilitation plan on November 7, 2012 that required contribution increases and reductions to benefit provisions. Although our
collective bargaining agreements with the Fund expired during 2016, we are obligated to make contributions to the Fund and we continue to work with the union toward reaching an agreement. The Fund’s actuarial valuation was last completed as of
January 1, 2016. As of August 28, 2016, the 10% surcharge is no longer applicable but we are required to pay higher contributions under the Fund’s rehabilitation plan.

Other Costs:

We sponsor and contribute to employee defined contribution
plans. These plans cover eligible salaried,

non-union

and union employees. Our contributions and costs are determined by the matching of employee contributions, as defined by the plans. Amounts charged to
expense in continuing operations for defined contribution plans totaled $44 million in 2016, $45 million in 2015 and $46 million in 2014.

Year-end

discount rates for our U.S., Canadian and U.K. plans were developed from a model
portfolio of high quality,

fixed-income

debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations.

Year-end

discount rates for
our remaining

non-U.S.

plans were developed from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond
yields year-over-year. Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs.

At the end 2015, we changed the approach used to measure service and
interest costs for other postretirement benefits. For 2015, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. For 2016, we measured service and
interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe the new approach provided a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the
plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. The impact of this change was a decrease in net periodic postretirement cost of approximately $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change
does not affect the measurement of our plan obligations. We accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, accounted for it on a prospective basis.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant impact on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A

one-percentage-point

Note 10. Stock Plans

Under our
Amended and Restated 2005 Performance Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), we are authorized through May 21, 2024 to issue a maximum of 243.7 million shares of our Common Stock to employees and

non-employee

directors. As of December 31, 2016, there were 74.2 million shares available to be granted under the Plan.

Stock Options:

Stock options (including stock appreciation rights) are
granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the grant date, generally become exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a maximum term of ten years.

We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a

Black-Scholes

methodology to
measure stock option expense at the date of grant. The fair value of the stock options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period. We recorded compensation expense related to stock options held by our employees of
$57 million in 2016, $50 million in 2015 and $47 million in 2014 in our results from continuing operations. The deferred tax benefit recorded related to this compensation expense was $15 million in 2016, $13 million in 2015
and $12 million in 2014. The unamortized compensation expense related to our employee stock options was $52 million at December 31, 2016 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1 year.

Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions were:

The risk-free interest rate represents the constant maturity U.S. government treasuries rate with a remaining term equal to the
expected life of the options. The expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. Volatility reflects historical movements in our stock price for a period commensurate with the expected life of the options.
The dividend yield reflects the dividend yield in place at the time of the historical grants.

Deferred Stock Units, Performance Share Units and Restricted
Stock:

Historically we have made grants of deferred stock units, performance share units and restricted stock. Beginning in 2016, we only grant deferred stock
units and performance share units and no longer grant restricted stock. We may grant shares of deferred stock units to eligible employees, giving them, in most instances, all of the rights of shareholders, except that they may not sell, assign,
pledge or otherwise encumber the shares and our deferred stock units do not have voting rights until vested. Shares of deferred stock units are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. Deferred stock units generally vest
on the third anniversary of the grant date. Performance share units granted under our 2005 Plan vest based on varying performance, market and service conditions. The unvested performance share units have no voting rights and do not pay dividends.
Dividend equivalents accumulated over the vesting period are paid only after the performance share units vest.

The fair value of the deferred stock units,
performance share units and restricted stock at the date of grant is amortized to earnings over the restriction period. We recorded compensation expense related to deferred stock units, performance share units and restricted stock of
$83 million in 2016, $86 million in 2015 and $94 million in 2014 in our results from continuing operations. The deferred tax benefit recorded related to this compensation expense was $22 million in 2016, $24 million in 2015
and $26 million in 2014. The unamortized compensation expense related to our deferred stock units, performance share units and restricted stock was $111 million at December 31, 2016 and is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 2 years.

Share Repurchase
Program:

During 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $7.7 billion of our Common Stock through December 31, 2016. On July 29,
2015, our Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase program, raising the authorization to $13.7 billion of Common Stock repurchases, and
extended the program through December 31, 2018. Repurchases under the program are determined by management and are wholly discretionary. Prior to January 1, 2016, we had repurchased $8.2 billion of Common Stock pursuant to this
authorization. During 2016, we repurchased 62.0 million shares of Common Stock at an average cost of $41.97 per share, or an aggregate cost of $2.6 billion, all of which was paid during 2016. All share repurchases were funded through
available cash and commercial paper issuances. During 2015, we repurchased 91.9 million shares of Common Stock at an average cost of $39.43 per share, or an aggregate cost of $3.6 billion, all of which was paid during 2015. As of
December 31, 2016, we have $2.8 billion in remaining share repurchase capacity.

In December 2013, we initiated an accelerated share repurchase
(“ASR”) program. On December 3, 2013, we paid $1.7 billion and received an initial delivery of 44.8 million shares of Common Stock valued at $1.5 billion. We increased treasury stock by $1.5 billion, and the
remaining $0.2 billion was recorded against additional paid in capital. In May 2014, the ASR program concluded and we received an additional 5.1 million shares, valued at $0.2 billion, for a total of 49.9 million shares with an
average repurchase price of $34.10 per share over the life of the ASR program. The final settlement was based on the volume-weighted average price of our Common Stock during the purchase period less a fixed per share discount. Upon conclusion of the
ASR program and receipt of the remaining repurchased shares, the $0.2 billion recorded in additional paid in capital was reclassified to treasury stock.

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings:

We routinely are involved in legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations (“Legal Matters”) arising in the ordinary course of our
business.

As we previously disclosed in February 2011, we received a subpoena from the SEC in connection with an investigation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (“FCPA”), primarily related to a facility in India that we acquired in the Cadbury acquisition. The subpoena primarily requested information regarding dealings with Indian governmental agencies and officials to obtain approvals related
to the operation of that facility. In January 2017, we reached an agreement with the SEC to settle charges related to internal controls and

books-and-records

provisions
of the FCPA without admitting or denying the charges. As part of the settlement, Mondelēz International Inc. agreed to pay a civil penalty of $13 million to resolve the investigation. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our
business or financial condition as a result of resolving this matter.



In February 2013 and March 2014, Cadbury India Limited (now known as Mondelez India Foods Private Limited), a subsidiary of
Mondelēz International, and other parties received show cause notices from the Indian Central Excise Authority (the “Excise Authority”) calling upon the parties to demonstrate why the Excise Authority should not collect a total of
3.7 billion Indian rupees ($55 million as of December 31, 2016) of unpaid excise tax and an equivalent amount of penalties, as well as interest, related to production at the same Indian facility. We contested these demands for unpaid
excise taxes, penalties and interest. On March 27, 2015, after several hearings, the Commissioner of the Excise Authority issued an order denying the excise exemption that we claimed for the Indian facility and confirming the Excise
Authority’s demands for total taxes and penalties in the amount of 5.8 billion Indian rupees ($86 million as of December 31, 2016). We have appealed this order. In addition, the Excise Authority issued additional show cause
notices in February 2015 and December 2015 on the same issue but covering the periods January to October 2014 and November 2014 to September 2015, respectively. These notices added a total of 2.4 billion Indian rupees ($35 million as of
December 31, 2016) of unpaid excise taxes as well as penalties to be determined up to an amount equivalent to that claimed by the Excise Authority and interest. We believe that the decision to claim the excise tax benefit is valid and we are
continuing to contest the show cause notices through the administrative and judicial process.

In April 2013, the staff of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (“CFTC”) advised us and Kraft Foods Group that it was investigating activities related to the trading of December 2011 wheat futures contracts that occurred prior to the

Spin-Off

of Kraft
Foods Group. We cooperated with the staff in its investigation. On April 1, 2015, the CFTC filed a complaint against Kraft Foods Group and Mondelēz Global LLC (“Mondelēz Global”) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois, Eastern Division (the “CFTC action”). The complaint alleges that Kraft Foods Group and Mondelēz Global (1) manipulated or attempted to manipulate the wheat markets during the fall of 2011; (2) violated
position limit levels for wheat futures and (3) engaged in

non-competitive

trades by trading both sides of

exchange-for-physical

Chicago Board of Trade wheat contracts. The CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties of either triple the monetary gain for each violation of the
Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act”) or $1 million for each violation of Section 6(c)(1), 6(c)(3) or 9(a)(2) of the Act and $140,000 for each additional violation of the Act, plus post-judgment interest; an order of permanent
injunction prohibiting Kraft Foods Group and Mondelēz Global from violating specified provisions of the Act; disgorgement of profits; and costs and fees. In December 2015, the court denied Mondelēz Global and Kraft Foods Group’s
motion to dismiss the CFTC’s claims of market manipulation and attempted manipulation, and the parties are now in discovery. Additionally, several class action complaints were filed against Kraft Foods Group and Mondelēz Global in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by investors in wheat futures and options on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. The complaints make similar allegations as those made in the CFTC action and seek class action
certification; an unspecified amount for damages, interest and unjust enrichment; costs and fees; and injunctive, declaratory and other unspecified relief. In June 2015, these suits were consolidated in the Northern District of Illinois. In June
2016, the court denied Mondelēz Global and Kraft Foods Group’s motion to dismiss, and the parties are now in discovery. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters; however, based on our Separation and Distribution Agreement
with Kraft Foods Group dated as of September 27, 2012, we expect to predominantly bear any monetary penalties or other payments in connection with the CFTC action.

While we cannot predict with certainty the results of any Legal Matters in which we are currently involved, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of
these Legal Matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our financial results.

Third-Party Guarantees:

We enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will
make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2016, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.

Leases:

Rental expenses recorded in continuing operations were
$317 million in 2016, $331 million in 2015 and $399 million in 2014. As of December 31, 2016, minimum rental commitments under

Our 2016 effective tax rate of 8.9% was favorably impacted by the mix of

pre-tax

income in various

non-U.S.

tax jurisdictions and net tax benefits from $161 million of discrete

one-time

events. The discrete net tax benefits related to favorable
audit settlements and statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and the net reduction of our U.K. and French deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2016 that reduced the corporate income tax rates in each
country.

Our 2015 effective tax rate of 7.5% was favorably impacted by the

one-time

third quarter sale of our coffee
business that resulted in a

pre-tax

gain of $6,809 million and $184 million of related tax expense, as well as $27 million of tax costs incurred to remit proceeds up from lower-tier foreign
subsidiaries to allow cash to be redeployed within our retained foreign operations. The benefit of the third quarter transaction was partially offset by the tax costs associated with the sale of our interest in AGF in the first half of the year and
the impact of deconsolidating our Venezuelan operations on December 31, 2015. Excluding the impacts of these transactions, our effective tax rate would have been 17.8%, reflecting favorable impacts from the mix of

pre-tax

income in various

non-U.S.

tax jurisdictions and net tax benefits from $119 million of discrete

one-time

events. The
remaining discrete

one-time

events primarily related to favorable tax audit settlements and expirations of statutes of limitations in several jurisdictions and the net reduction of U.K. deferred tax
liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2015 that reduced the U.K. corporate income tax rate.

Our 2014 effective tax rate of 13.8% was favorably
impacted by the mix of

pre-tax

income in various

non-U.S.

tax jurisdictions and net tax benefits from $206 million of discrete

one-time

events. The discrete net tax benefits primarily related to favorable tax audit settlements and expirations of statues of limitations in several jurisdictions.

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:

At December 31, 2016, the company has

pre-tax

loss carryforwards of
$3,517 million, of which $1,223 million will expire at various dates between 2017 and 2036 and the remaining $2,294 million can be carried forward indefinitely.

Our significant valuation allowances relate to loss carryforwards in Mexico and Ireland where we do not currently expect to generate gains of the proper character to
utilize the carryforwards in the future.

At December 31, 2016, neither applicable U.S. federal income taxes nor foreign withholding taxes have been provided
on approximately $19.8 billion of accumulated earnings of

non-U.S.

subsidiaries that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. It is impracticable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred
tax liabilities on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. Future tax law changes or changes in the needs of our

non-U.S.

subsidiaries could require us to recognize deferred tax liabilities on a portion, or
all, of our accumulated earnings that were previously expected to be indefinitely reinvested.

As of January 1, 2016, our unrecognized tax benefits were $756 million. If we had recognized all of these benefits, the
net impact on our income tax provision would have been $652 million. Our unrecognized tax benefits were $610 million at December 31, 2016, and if we had recognized all of these benefits, the net impact on our income tax provision
would have been $549 million. Within the next 12 months, our unrecognized tax benefits could increase by approximately $40 million due to unfavorable audit developments or decrease by approximately $160 million due to audit
settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. We include accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our tax provision. We had accrued interest and penalties of $185 million as of
January 1, 2016 and $189 million as of December 31, 2016. Our 2016 provision for income taxes included $15 million for interest and penalties.

Our income tax filings are regularly examined by federal, state and

non-U.S.

tax authorities. Examination by the IRS of our
2013-2015 U.S. federal income tax filings will begin in the first quarter of 2017. U.S. state and

non-U.S.

jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from three to five years; however, these
statutes are often extended by mutual agreement with the tax authorities. Years still open to examination by

non-U.S.

tax authorities in major jurisdictions include (earliest open tax year in parentheses):
Brazil (2011), China (2007), France (2010), Germany (2010), India (2005), Italy (2011) and the United Kingdom (2013).

Note 16. Segment Reporting

We
manufacture and market primarily snack food products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy and various cheese & grocery products, as well as powdered beverage products. We manage our
global business and report operating results through geographic units.

Our operations and management structure are organized into four reportable operating
segments:

•

Latin America

•

AMEA

•

Europe

•

North America

On October 1, 2016, we integrated our EEMEA operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific
operating segments to further leverage and optimize the operating scale built within the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined within our Europe operating segment, while the remaining
Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific region to form the AMEA regional operating segment. We have reflected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented.

We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth
opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments were part of our base business. Beginning in the
third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for our new coffee equity method investment in JDE, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in equity method investment earnings outside of segment operating income. For
the six months ended December 31, 2015,

after-tax

equity method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis. Earnings from equity method investments through July 2,
2015 recorded within segment operating income were $52 million in AMEA and $4 million in North America. For the year ended December 31, 2014, these earnings were $104 million in AMEA and $9 million in North America. See Note
1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Principles of Consolidation,

and Note 2,

Divestitures and Acquisitions

,

for additional information.

In 2015, we also began to report stock-based compensation for our corporate employees within general corporate expenses that were reported within our North America
region. We reclassified $32 million of corporate stock-based compensation expense in 2015 from the North America segment to general corporate expenses.

We use
segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and
losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on divestitures or acquisitions,
gain on the JDE coffee business transactions, loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment
operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, we do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the
segment profitability measure that management reviews.

Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with
the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in

after-tax

equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. As the

after-tax

equity method investment net earnings for the six months ended December 31, 2015 was less than $1 million, this line item is not shown on our consolidated statement of earnings.

Pre-tax

earnings from equity method investments recorded within segment operating income were $56 million for the six months ended July 2, 2015. See Note 1,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
– Principles of Consolidation,

for additional information. Equity method investment net earnings were lower in the third quarter of 2016 due to the JDE unfavorable tax expense disclosed in Note 2,

Divestitures and
Acquisitions – JDE Tax Matter Resolution

.

(2)

See the following table for significant items that affected the comparability of earnings each quarter.

(3)

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a net loss, primarily due to the loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela and coffee business transaction final sales price adjustment. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, due to the net
loss in the quarter, diluted EPS was equal to basic EPS.

Basic and diluted EPS are computed independently for each of the periods presented.
Accordingly, the sum of the quarterly EPS amounts may not equal the total for the year.

During 2016 and 2015, we recorded the following

Item  9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial
Disclosure.

None.

Item  9A.
Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
(“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures as of December 31, 2016. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2016.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO
and CFO, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

•

provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. Management based this assessment on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).

Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2016, based on the
criteria in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, as stated in their report that appears under Item 8.

February 24, 2017



Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2016.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we worked with outsourced partners to further simplify and standardize processes and focus on scalable, transactional processes across all regions. Specifically during the fourth quarter of 2016, we
continued to migrate some of our procurement administration functions for Middle East, Africa and Turkey to an outsourced partner. Additionally, we continued to transition some of our transactional data processing as well as financial and local tax
reporting for a number of countries in all regions (including

order-to-cash

in our Europe and AMEA regions) to three outsourced partners. Pursuant to our service
agreements, the controls previously established around these accounting functions will be maintained by our outsourced partners or by us, and they are subject to management’s internal control testing. There were no other changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B. Other Information.

None.
