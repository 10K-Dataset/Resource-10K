PART I

Item 1.

Business.

(a)    General Development of Business

General

Kraft Foods Inc. ("Kraft") was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Following Kraft's formation, Altria Group, Inc. (formerly
Philip Morris Companies Inc.) transferred to Kraft its ownership interest in Kraft Foods North America, Inc. ("Kraft Foods North America"), a Delaware corporation, through a capital
contribution. In addition, during 2000, a subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. transferred management responsibility for its food businesses in Latin America to Kraft Foods North America and its
wholly owned subsidiary, Kraft Foods International, Inc. ("Kraft Foods International"). On December 11, 2000, Kraft acquired all of the outstanding shares of Nabisco Holdings Corp.
("Nabisco"). Kraft, through its subsidiaries (Kraft and its subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as the "Company"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of branded foods and beverages in the
United States, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa.

Prior
to June 13, 2001, the Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. On June 13, 2001, the Company completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of
280,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock at a price of $31.00 per share. The IPO proceeds, net of the underwriting discount and expenses, of $8.4 billion were used to retire a
portion of an $11.0 billion long-term note payable to Altria Group, Inc., incurred in connection with the acquisition of Nabisco. After the IPO, Altria
Group, Inc. owned approximately 83.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company's capital stock through its ownership of 49.5% of the Company's Class A common stock and 100% of the
Company's Class B common stock. The Company's Class A common stock has one vote per share, while the Company's Class B common stock has ten votes per share. At December 31,
2002, Altria Group, Inc. held 97.8% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding capital stock and owned approximately 84.2% of the outstanding shares of the Company's capital
stock.

Source of Funds—Dividends

Because the Company is a holding company, its principal source of funds is dividends from its subsidiaries. The Company's principal wholly owned subsidiaries
currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock.

(b)    Financial Information About Industry Segments

The Company conducts its global business through its subsidiaries: Kraft Foods North America and Kraft Foods International. The Company has operations in 68
countries and sells its products in more than 150 countries. Kraft Foods North America operates in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and manages its operations by product category, while Kraft
Foods International manages its operations by geographic region. Kraft Foods North America's reportable segments are Cheese, Meals and Enhancers; Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery; Beverages,
Desserts and Cereals; and Oscar Mayer and Pizza. Kraft Foods North America's food service business within the United States and its businesses in Canada and Mexico are reported through the Cheese,
Meals and Enhancers segment. Kraft Foods International's reportable segments are Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Latin America and Asia Pacific.


Net
revenues and operating companies income* attributable to each such segment (together with a reconciliation to consolidated operating income) for each of the last three years are set
forth in Note 13 to the Company's consolidated financial statements and are incorporated herein by reference to the 2002 Annual Report.

The
relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows:

(c)    Narrative Description of Business

Acquisitions and Divestitures

Nabisco Acquisition

On December 11, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Nabisco. The purchase of the outstanding shares, retirement of employee stock
options and other payments totaled approximately $15.2 billion. In addition, the acquisition included the assumption of approximately $4.0 billion of existing Nabisco debt. The Company
financed the acquisition through the issuance of two long-term notes payable to Altria Group, Inc., totaling $15.0 billion, and short-term intercompany borrowings
of $255 million. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. Beginning January 1, 2001, Nabisco's earnings have been included in the consolidated operating results of the
Company.

The
integration of Nabisco into the Company has continued throughout 2001 and 2002. The closure of a number of Nabisco domestic and international facilities resulted in severance and
other exit costs of $379 million, which are included in the adjustments for the allocation of the purchase price. The closures will result in the termination of approximately 7,500 employees
and will require total cash payments of $373 million, of which approximately $190 million had been spent through December 31, 2002. Substantially all of the closures were
completed as of December 31, 2002, and the remaining payments relate to salary continuation payments for severed employees and lease payments.

*

Management
uses operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to manage and to evaluate the
performance of Kraft and its operating subsidiaries. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to assist investors with analyzing business performance and trends. This measure
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.


The
integration of Nabisco into the operations of the Company has also resulted in the closure or reconfiguration of several of the Company's existing facilities. The aggregate charges
to the Company's consolidated statement of earnings to close or reconfigure its facilities and integrate Nabisco were originally estimated to be in the range of $200 million to
$300 million. During 2002, the Company recorded pre-tax integration related charges of $115 million to consolidate production lines, close facilities and for other
consolidation programs. In addition, during 2001, the Company incurred pre-tax integration costs of $53 million for site reconfigurations and other consolidation programs in the
United States. The integration related charges of $168 million included $27 million relating to severance, $117 million relating to asset write-offs and
$24 million relating to other cash exit costs. Cash payments relating to these charges will approximate $51 million, of which $21 million has been paid through December 31,
2002. In addition, during 2002, approximately 700 salaried employees elected to retire or terminate employment under voluntary retirement programs. As a result, the Company recorded a
pre-tax charge of $142 million related to these programs. As of December 31, 2002, the aggregate pre-tax charges to close or reconfigure the Company's facilities
and integrate Nabisco, including charges for early retirement programs, were $310 million, slightly above the original estimate. No additional pre-tax charges are expected to be
recorded for these programs.

By
combining Nabisco's operations with the operations of Kraft Foods North America and Kraft Foods International, the Company achieved annualized net cost synergy savings of
$425 million through 2002 from the pre-acquisition cost structures of continuing businesses, expects to generate annualized additional net cost synergies of $140 million to
$150 million in 2003 and expects to achieve its target of annualized net cost synergies of $600 million by 2004.

Other Acquisitions and Divestitures

During 2002, the Company acquired a snacks business in Turkey and a biscuits business in Australia. The total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was
$122 million. During 2001, the Company purchased coffee businesses in Romania, Morocco and Bulgaria and also acquired confectionery businesses in Russia and Poland. The total cost of these and
other smaller acquisitions was $194 million. During 2000, the Company purchased Balance Bar Co. and Boca Burger, Inc. The total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was
$365 million.

During
2002, the Company sold several small North American food businesses. In addition, the Company sold its Latin American yeast and industrial bakery ingredients business for
$110 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $69 million. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses during 2002 were $219 million, on which the Company
recorded pre-tax gains of $80 million. During 2001, the Company sold several small food businesses. The aggregate proceeds received in these transactions were $21 million, on
which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $8 million. During 2000, the Company sold a French confectionery business for proceeds of $251 million, on which a
pre-tax gain of $139 million was recorded. Several small international and North American food businesses were also sold in 2000. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of
businesses during 2000 were $300 million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $172 million.

The
impact of these acquisitions and divestitures, excluding Nabisco, has not had a material effect on the Company's results of operations.

Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials

Kraft Foods North America's products are generally sold to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors,
convenience stores, gasoline stations and other retail food outlets. In general, the retail trade for food products is consolidating. Food products are distributed through distribution centers,
satellite warehouses, company-operated and public cold-storage facilities, depots and other facilities. Most distribution in North America is in the form of warehouse delivery, but
biscuits and frozen pizza are distributed through two direct-store-delivery systems. Selling efforts are supported by national and regional advertising on television and radio as


well as outdoor media such as billboards and in magazines and newspapers, as well as by sales promotions, product displays, trade incentives, informative material offered to customers and other
promotional activities. Subsidiaries and affiliates of Kraft Foods International sell their food products primarily in the same manner and also engage the services of independent sales offices and
agents.

Kraft
Foods North America, Kraft Foods International and their subsidiaries are subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of their business. Competitors include large national and
international companies and numerous local and regional companies. Some competitors may have different profit objectives and some international competitors may be more or less susceptible to currency
exchange rates. In addition, certain international competitors benefit from government subsidies. Products of Kraft Foods North America and Kraft Foods International also compete with generic products
and private-label products of food retailers, wholesalers and cooperatives. Kraft Foods North America, Kraft Foods International and their subsidiaries compete primarily on the basis of product
quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. Substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to maintain or improve a brand's market position
or to introduce a new product.

Kraft
Foods North America, Kraft Foods International and their subsidiaries are major purchasers of milk, cheese, nuts, green coffee beans, cocoa, corn products, wheat, rice, pork,
poultry, beef, vegetable oil, and sugar and other sweeteners. They also use significant quantities of glass, plastic and cardboard to package their products. They continuously monitor worldwide supply
and cost trends of these commodities to enable them to take appropriate action to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production.

Kraft
Foods North America, Kraft Foods International and their subsidiaries purchase a substantial portion of their milk requirements from independent agricultural cooperatives and
individual producers, and a substantial portion of their cheese requirements from independent sources. The prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by government
programs, as well as by market supply and demand. Dairy commodity costs on average were lower in 2002 than those seen in 2001.

The
most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans, which are purchased on world markets. Green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of
supply, trade agreements among producing and consuming nations, the unilateral policies of the producing nations, changes in the value of the United States dollar in relation to certain other
currencies and consumer demand for coffee products. In 2002, coffee bean prices were lower than in 2001. A significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa, which is purchased on
world markets, and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the British pound sterling and the United States dollar relative to certain
other currencies. In 2002, cocoa bean prices were higher than in 2001.

The
prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in the products of Kraft Foods North America, Kraft Foods International and their subsidiaries generally reflect
external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of the principal raw
materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, the Company believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. The Company uses
hedging techniques to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in their principal raw materials. However, they do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not
protect the Company or its subsidiaries from increases in specific raw material costs.


Regulation

All of Kraft Foods North America's United States food products and packaging materials are subject to regulations administered by the Food and Drug Administration
("FDA") or, with respect to products containing meat and poultry, the United States Department of Agriculture. Among other things, these agencies enforce statutory prohibitions against misbranded and
adulterated foods, establish safety standards for food processing, establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain foods, establish standards of identity for certain foods, determine
the safety of food additives and establish labeling standards and nutrition labeling requirements for food products.

In
addition, various states regulate the business of Kraft Foods North America's operating units by licensing dairy plants, enforcing federal and state standards of identity for selected
food products, grading food products, inspecting plants, regulating certain trade practices in connection with the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products.

Many
of the food commodities on which Kraft Foods North America's United States businesses rely are subject to governmental agricultural programs. These programs have substantial effects
on prices and supplies and are subject to Congressional and administrative review.

Almost
all of the activities of the Company's food operations outside of the United States are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to Kraft Foods North
America's United States businesses and, in some cases, international regulatory provisions, such as those of the European Union relating to labeling, packaging, food content, pricing, marketing and
advertising and related areas.

The
European Union and certain individual countries require that food products containing genetically modified organisms or classes of ingredients derived from them be labeled
accordingly. Other countries may adopt similar regulations. The FDA has concluded that there is no basis for similar mandatory labeling under current United States law.

Other Matters

Customers

For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company's five largest customers accounted for approximately 26.9% of its net revenues, while the Company's ten
largest customers accounted for approximately 36.9% of its net revenues. One of the Company's customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 12.2% of net revenues for
2002.

Employees

At December 31, 2002, the Company employed approximately 109,000 people worldwide. Approximately one-third of the Company's 50,000 employees in
the United States are represented by labor unions. Most of the unionized workers at the Company's domestic locations are represented under contracts with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and
Grain Millers International Union; the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union; and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. These contracts expire at various times throughout the
next several years. Outside the United States, approximately one-half of the Company's 59,000 employees are represented by labor unions or workers' councils. The Company's business units
are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. These laws and regulations are specific to the location of each enterprise. In addition, in
accordance with European Union requirements, Kraft Foods International has established European Works Councils composed of management and elected members of its workforce. The Company believes that
its relations with employees and their representative organizations are good.


Research and Development

The Company pursues four objectives in research and development: uncompromising product safety and quality; growth through new products; superior consumer
satisfaction; and reduced costs.

The
Company's research and development resources include more than 2,000 food scientists, chemists and engineers, deployed primarily in five key technology centers: East Hanover, New
Jersey; Glenview, Illinois; Tarrytown, New York; Banbury, United Kingdom; and Munich, Germany. These technology centers are equipped with pilot plants and
state-of-the-art instruments. Research and development expense was $360 million in 2002, $358 million in 2001 and $270 million in 2000.

Trademarks and Intellectual Property

Trademarks are of material importance to the Company's businesses and are protected by registration or otherwise in the United States and most other markets where
the related products are sold. The Company has from time to time granted various parties exclusive or non-exclusive licenses to use one or more of its trademarks in particular locations.
The Company does not believe that these licensing arrangements have had a material effect on the conduct of its business or operating results.

Some
of the Company's products are sold under brands that have been licensed from others on terms that are generally renewable at the Company's discretion. These licensed brands include

Starbucks

bagged
coffee for sale in United States grocery stores,

Capri Sun

aseptic juice drinks for
sale in North America,

Taco Bell

Mexican style food products for sale in United States grocery stores,

California Pizza
Kitchen

frozen pizzas for sale in grocery stores in the United States and Canada,

Pebbles

ready-to-eat
cereals and

Breyers

yogurt products.

Similarly,
the Company owns thousands of patents worldwide, and the patent portfolio as a whole is material to the Company's business; however, no one patent or group of related patents
is material to the Company. In addition, the Company has proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Environmental Regulation

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise
related to environmental protection, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as "Superfund"), which imposes joint and several liability on each responsible party. In 2002, subsidiaries of the Company were involved in 96 active Superfund
and other actions in the United States related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which the Company retains liability.

Outside
the United States, the Company is subject to applicable multi-national, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the host countries in which the Company does
business. The Company has specific programs across its international business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements.

Although
it is not possible to predict precisely the estimated costs for such environmental-related expenditures, compliance with such laws and regulations, including the payment of any
remediation costs and the making of such expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, capital expenditures, financial
position, earnings, cash flows or competitive position.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in the Company's filings
with the SEC and in its reports to shareholders. One can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as "strategy," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will,"
"continues," "estimates," "intends," "projects,"


"goals," "targets" and other words of similar meaning. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are based on our
assumptions and estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties. In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is hereby
identifying important factors that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement made by or on behalf of the Company; any such
statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements.

Each
of the Company's segments is subject to intense competition, changes in consumer preferences, the effects of changing prices for its raw materials and local economic conditions.
Their results are dependent upon their continued ability to promote brand equity successfully, to anticipate and respond to new consumer trends, to develop new products and markets, to broaden brand
portfolios in order to compete effectively with lower priced products in a consolidating
environment at the retail and manufacturing levels, and to improve productivity. The Company's results are also dependent on its ability to consummate and successfully integrate acquisitions,
including its ability to derive cost savings from the integration of Nabisco's operations with the Company. In addition, the Company is subject to the effects of foreign economies, currency movements
and fluctuations in levels of customer inventories. The Company's benefit expense is subject to the investment performance of pension plan assets, interest rates and cost increases for medical
benefits offered to employees and retirees. The food industry continues to be subject to recalls if products become adulterated or misbranded, liability if product consumption causes injury,
ingredient disclosure and labeling laws and regulations and the possibility that consumers could lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products. Developments in any of these areas,
which are more fully described elsewhere in this document and which descriptions are incorporated into this section by reference, could cause the Company's results to differ materially from results
that have been or may be projected by or on behalf of the Company. The Company cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive. Any forward-looking statements are made as of the
date of the document in which they appear. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company.

(d)    Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales

The amounts of net revenues, total assets and long-lived assets attributable to each of the Company's geographic segments for each of the last three
fiscal years are set forth in Note 13 to the Company's consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference to the 2002 Annual Report.

Kraft's
subsidiaries export coffee products, grocery products, cheese and processed meats. In 2002, exports from the United States by these subsidiaries amounted to approximately
$170 million.

Item 2.

Properties.

The
Company has 207 manufacturing and processing facilities worldwide. In North America, the Company has 95 facilities, and outside of North America there are 112 facilities located in
44 countries. These manufacturing and processing facilities are located throughout the following territories:

Territory

Number

of

Facilities

United States


Canada


Mexico


Western Europe


Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa


Latin America


Asia Pacific


Total


The
Company owns 196 and leases 11 of these manufacturing and processing facilities. All of the Company's plants and properties are maintained in good condition, and the Company believes
that they are suitable and adequate for its present needs.

The
integration of Nabisco into the operations of the Company resulted in the closure of seven Nabisco facilities during 2001 and 10 Nabisco facilities during 2002.

As
of December 31, 2002, the Company's distribution facilities consisted of 419 distribution centers and depots worldwide. In North America, the Company had 372 distribution
centers and depots, more than 80% of which support the Company's direct-store-delivery systems. Outside North America, the Company had 47 distribution centers in 21 countries. The Company owns 80 of
these distribution centers and two of these depots and leases 152 of these distribution centers and 185 of these depots. The Company believes that all of these facilities are in good condition and
have sufficient capacity to meet the Company's distribution needs for the foreseeable future.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is party to a variety of legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business, including the matters discussed below. While the results of
litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or
financial position.

In
May 2002, the Company was served with a lawsuit filed in California by the American Environmental Safety Institute against several major chocolate manufacturers alleging that
the defendants' chocolate products contain "potentially dangerous levels of lead and cadmium." The suit alleges that these levels, which are not disclosed on the product labels, are a violation of
California's

Proposition 65

, which requires a warning on products containing chemicals "known to the State" to be carcinogens or reproductive
toxicants. The suit is in the discovery phase, and various procedural motions and defenses are being pursued. The Company believes that the suit is without merit, and the California Attorney General
has publicly stated that the case is without merit.

Since
1996, seven putative class actions have been filed by various dairy farmers alleging that the Company and others engaged in a conspiracy to fix and depress the prices of milk
through their trading activity on the National Cheese Exchange. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and equitable relief and


unspecified treble damages. Two of the actions were voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs after class certification was denied. Three cases were consolidated in state court in Wisconsin, and, in
November 1999, the court granted the Company's motion for summary judgment. In June 2001, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling dismissing the cases. In
April 2002, the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the intermediate appellate court's ruling, and plaintiffs filed a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. In
December 2002, the Supreme Court denied plaintiffs' petition. In April 2002, the Company's motion for summary judgment dismissing the case was granted in a case pending in the United
States District Court for the Central District of California. In June 2002, the parties settled the California case on an individual (non-class) basis, and plaintiffs dismissed
their appeal. A case in Illinois state court has been settled and dismissed. No cases remain pending at this time.

Environmental Matters

In May 2001, the State of Ohio notified the Company that it may be subject to an enforcement action for alleged past violations of the Company's wastewater
discharge permit at its production facility in Farmdale, Ohio. The State has offered to attempt to negotiate a settlement of this matter, and the Company has accepted the offer to do so. The State has
not yet identified the relief it may seek in this matter.

The
Company is potentially liable for certain environmental matters arising from the operations of Nabisco's former wholly owned subsidiary, Rowe Industries. Rowe operated a small engine
manufacturing facility in Sag Harbor, New York in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s that used various solvents. About 20 homes downgradient from the site were connected to public drinking water
in the mid-1980s after solvents were detected in their individual wells. Since 1996, three toxic tort cases have been brought against Nabisco in New York state court, collectively by or on
behalf of approximately 80 individuals, including 17 minors. The first case was filed on March 6, 1996, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York and was subsequently
dismissed by the trial court. That decision was affirmed on appeal. The other two cases both were filed on January 3, 2000, also in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. That court
granted defendant's summary judgment motion as to all but one of the plaintiffs in each of the remaining cases, and the plaintiffs have now withdrawn their appeal of this ruling. In
August 2002, the court entered summary judgment against the remaining two plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have appealed this judgment, and the appeal is currently pending.

Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.

The information called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraph captioned "Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)" on page 62 of
the 2002 Annual Report and made a part hereof.

The
principal stock exchange on which the Company's Class A common stock is listed is the New York Stock Exchange. At January 31, 2003, there were approximately
2,100 holders of record of the Company's Class A common stock.

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data.

The information called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference to the information with respect to 1998-2002 appearing under the caption
"Selected Financial Data" on page 43 of the 2002 Annual Report and made a part hereof.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The information called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" (the "MD&A") on pages 26 to 42 of the 2002 Annual Report and made a part hereof.

Following
a $10.1 billion judgment on March 21, 2003 against Altria Group, Inc.'s domestic tobacco subsidiary, Philip Morris USA Inc., the three major credit
rating agencies placed Altria Group, Inc.'s credit ratings on watch with negative implications. While the Company is not a party to, and has no exposure to, this litigation, its credit ratings
are affected by those of Altria Group, Inc., and accordingly, its ratings were also placed on watch with negative implications. The rating agencies' actions are expected to result in higher
short-term borrowing costs for the Company. None of the Company's debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a decrease in credit ratings.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The information called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs in the MD&A captioned "Market Risk" and "Value at Risk" on

Within the 90 days prior to the filing date of this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company's management, including the Company's Chairman, Co-Chief Executive Officers, and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, the Chairman, Co-Chief Executive
Officers, and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including
its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company's periodic SEC filings. Since the date of the evaluation, there have been no significant changes in the Company's internal
controls or in other factors that could significantly affect the controls.
