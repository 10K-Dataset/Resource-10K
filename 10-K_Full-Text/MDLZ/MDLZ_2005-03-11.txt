PART I

Item 1.

Business.

(a)

General Development of Business

General

Kraft Foods Inc. ("Kraft") was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Kraft, through its subsidiaries (Kraft and its subsidiaries are
hereinafter referred to as the "Company"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of branded foods and beverages in the United States, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and
Africa.

Prior
to June 13, 2001, Kraft was a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. On June 13, 2001, Kraft completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of 280,000,000
shares of its Class A common stock at a price of $31.00 per share. At December 31, 2004, Altria Group, Inc. held 98.0% of the combined voting power of Kraft's outstanding capital
stock and owned 85.4% of the outstanding shares of Kraft's capital stock.

On
November 15, 2004, the Company announced the sale of substantially all of its sugar confectionery business for approximately $1.5 billion. The transaction, which is
subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2005. The Company has reflected
the results of its sugar confectionery business as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented. Accordingly, historical statements of earnings amounts
included in this Form 10-K have been restated to reflect the discontinued operation. The assets related to the sugar confectionery business were reflected as assets of discontinued
operations held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004.

In
January 2004, the Company announced a three-year restructuring program with the objectives of leveraging the Company's global scale, realigning and lowering the
cost structure, and optimizing capacity utilization. As part of this program, the Company anticipates the closing or sale of up to 20 plants and the elimination of approximately 6,000 positions. In
2004, the Company announced the closure of 13 plants. Specific programs announced during 2004, as part of the overall restructuring program, will result in the elimination of approximately 3,500
positions. From 2004 through 2006, the Company expects to incur up to $1.2 billion in pre-tax charges, reflecting asset disposals, severance and other implementation costs,
including $641 million incurred in 2004. Approximately one-half of the pre-tax charges are expected to require cash payments. In addition, the Company expects to incur
approximately $140 million in capital expenditures from 2004 through 2006 to implement the restructuring program, including $46 million spent in 2004. Cost savings as a result of this
program were approximately $127 million in 2004, are expected to increase by an incremental amount of approximately $120 million to $140 million in 2005, and are anticipated to
reach annualized cost savings of approximately $400 million by 2006. All of these cost savings are expected to be used in support of brand-building initiatives.

Source of Funds—Dividends

Because Kraft is a holding company, its principal source of funds is dividends from its subsidiaries. Kraft's principal wholly owned subsidiaries currently are
not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock.


(b)

Financial Information About Segments

The Company manufactures and markets packaged food products, consisting principally of beverages, cheese, snacks, convenient meals and various packaged grocery
products. The Company manages and reports operating results through two units: Kraft North America Commercial and Kraft International Commercial. The Company has operations in 68 countries and
sells its products in more than 155 countries. Kraft North America Commercial operates in the United States and Canada, and manages its operations principally by product category, while Kraft
International Commercial manages its operations by geographic region.

During
January 2004, the Company announced a new global organization structure, which resulted in new segments. During the fourth quarter of 2004, following the sale of its sugar
confectionery business, the Company realigned its North American segments. Kraft North America Commercial's new segments are U.S. Beverages; U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America Foodservice;
U.S. Convenient Meals; U.S. Grocery; and U.S. Snacks & Cereals. Kraft International Commercial's segments are Europe, Middle East & Africa; and Latin America & Asia Pacific. The
new segment structure in North America reflects a shift of certain divisions and brands among segments to more closely align these businesses to consumer sectors, to provide more focus on the separate
beverage and grocery businesses, and to benefit from synergies in grain based products. Historical data have been restated to reflect the new segment structure.

Net
revenues and operating companies income* attributable to each segment (together with a reconciliation to consolidated operating income) for each of the last three years are set forth
in Note 14 to the Company's consolidated financial statements contained in Part II hereof.

*

The
Company's management uses operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment
performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze business performance and trends of the various business segments.

The
relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows:

Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials

Kraft North America Commercial's products are generally sold to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors,
convenience stores, gasoline stations, drug stores, value stores and other retail food outlets. In general, the retail trade for food products is consolidating. Food products are distributed through
distribution centers, satellite warehouses, company-operated and public cold-storage facilities, depots and other facilities. Most distribution in North America is in the form of warehouse
delivery, but biscuits and frozen pizza are distributed through two direct-store delivery systems. The Company supports its selling efforts through three principal sets of activities: consumer
advertising in broadcast, print and outdoor media; consumer promotions such as coupons and contests; and trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of our products by
our customers. Subsidiaries and affiliates of Kraft International Commercial sell their food products primarily in the same manner and also engage the services of independent sales offices and agents.

Kraft
North America Commercial and Kraft International Commercial are subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of their business. Competitors include large national and
international companies and numerous local and regional companies. Some competitors may have different profit objectives and some international competitors may be more or less susceptible to currency
exchange rates. In addition, certain international competitors benefit from government subsidies. Products of Kraft North America Commercial and Kraft International Commercial also compete with
generic products and private-label products of food retailers, wholesalers and cooperatives. Kraft North America Commercial, Kraft International Commercial and their subsidiaries compete primarily on
the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and
price. Substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to maintain or improve a brand's market position or to introduce a new product.

Kraft
North America Commercial and Kraft International Commercial are major purchasers of milk, cheese, nuts, green coffee beans, cocoa, corn products, wheat, rice, pork, poultry, beef,
vegetable oil, and sugar and other sweeteners. They also use significant quantities of glass, plastic and cardboard to package their products. They continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost
trends of these commodities to enable them to take appropriate action to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production. Kraft North America Commercial and Kraft International Commercial
purchase a substantial portion of their dairy raw material requirements, including milk and cheese, from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors. The
prices for milk and other


dairy
product purchases are substantially influenced by government programs, as well as by market supply and demand. Dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2004 than in 2003. Dairy costs rose
to historical highs during the first half of 2004, but moderated during the second half of 2004.

The
most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans, which are purchased on world markets. Green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of
supply, trade agreements among producing and consuming nations, the unilateral policies of the producing nations, changes in the value of the United States dollar in relation to certain other
currencies and consumer demand for coffee products. In 2004, coffee bean costs on average were higher than in 2003. A significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa, which is
purchased on world markets, and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the British pound sterling and the United States dollar relative to
certain other currencies. In 2004, cocoa bean costs on average were lower than in 2003. For 2004, the pre-tax impact from all commodities was an approximate $930 million increase in
costs as compared with 2003.

The
prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in the products of Kraft North America Commercial and Kraft International Commercial generally reflect external factors
such as weather conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of the principal raw materials can be
expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, the Company believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. The Company uses hedging techniques
to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in its principal raw materials. However, it does not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect the Company or
its subsidiaries from increases in specific raw material costs.

Regulation

All of Kraft North America Commercial's United States food products and packaging materials are subject to regulations administered by the Food and Drug
Administration ("FDA") or, with respect to products containing meat and poultry, the United States Department of Agriculture. Among other things, these agencies enforce statutory prohibitions against
misbranded and adulterated foods, establish safety standards for food processing, establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain foods, establish standards of identity for certain
foods, determine the safety of food additives and establish labeling standards and nutrition labeling requirements for food products.

In
addition, various states regulate the business of Kraft North America Commercial's operating units by licensing dairy plants, enforcing federal and state standards of identity for
selected food products, grading food products, inspecting plants, regulating certain trade practices in connection with the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food
products.

Many
of the food commodities on which Kraft North America Commercial's United States businesses rely are subject to governmental agricultural programs. These programs have substantial
effects on prices and supplies and are subject to Congressional and administrative review.

Almost
all of the activities of the Company's food operations outside of the United States are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to Kraft North
America Commercial's United States businesses and, in some cases, international regulatory provisions, such as those of the European Union relating to labeling, packaging, food content, pricing,
marketing and advertising and related areas.

The
European Union and certain individual countries require that food products containing genetically modified organisms or classes of ingredients derived from them be labeled
accordingly. Other countries may adopt similar regulations. The FDA has concluded that there is no basis for similar mandatory labeling under current United States law.


Acquisitions and Divestitures

During 2004, the Company acquired a U.S.-based beverage business for a total cost of $137 million. During 2003, the Company acquired a biscuits business in
Egypt and trademarks associated with a
small U.S.-based natural foods business. The total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $98 million. During 2002, the Company acquired a snacks business in Turkey and a biscuits
business in Australia. The total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $122 million.

On
November 15, 2004, the Company announced the sale of substantially all of its sugar confectionery business for approximately $1.5 billion. The proposed sale includes the

Life Savers

,

Creme Savers

,

Altoids

,

Trolli

and

Sugus

brands. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be
completed in the second quarter of 2005. The Company has reflected the results of its sugar confectionery business as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of earnings for all years
presented. Pursuant to the sugar confectionery sale agreement, the Company has agreed to provide certain transition and supply services to the buyer. These service arrangements are primarily for terms
of one year or less, with the exception of one supply arrangement with a term of not more than three years. The expected cash flow from this supply arrangement is not significant.

During
2004, the Company sold a Brazilian snack nuts business and trademarks associated with a candy business in Norway. The aggregate proceeds received from the sale of these businesses
were $18 million, on which pre-tax losses of $3 million were recorded. In December 2004, the Company announced the sale of its U.K. desserts business for approximately
$135 million, which is expected to result in an estimated gain of $0.04 per share. The transaction closed in the first quarter of 2005. The Company also announced in December 2004, the
sale of its yogurt business for approximately $59 million, which is expected to result in an after-tax loss of approximately $12 million ($5 million in 2004, with the
remainder at closing). The transaction, which is also subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005. During 2003, the Company sold a European rice business
and a branded fresh cheese business in Italy. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses during 2003 were $96 million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of
$31 million. During 2002, the Company sold several small North American food businesses, some of which had been previously classified as businesses held for sale arising from the acquisition of
Nabisco. In addition, the Company sold its Latin American yeast and industrial bakery ingredients business for approximately $110 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of
$69 million. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses during 2002 were $219 million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $80 million.

The
operating results of the acquisitions and divestitures, except for the sale of the sugar confectionery business, were not material to the Company's consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.

Other Matters

Customers

For each of the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company's five largest customers accounted for approximately 28% of its net revenues, and the
Company's ten largest customers accounted for approximately 38% of its net revenues. One of the Company's customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 14% of net
revenues for 2004 and approximately 12% of net revenues for 2003.

Employees

At December 31, 2004, the Company employed approximately 98,000 people worldwide. Approximately 30% of the Company's 45,000 employees in the United States
are represented by labor unions. Most of the unionized workers at the Company's domestic locations are represented under


contracts
with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union; the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union; and the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters. These contracts expire at various times throughout the next several years. Outside the United States, labor unions or workers' councils represent approximately 50% of the Company's 53,000
employees. The Company's business units are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. These laws and regulations are specific to the location of
each enterprise. In addition, in accordance with European Union requirements, Kraft International Commercial has established European Works Councils composed of management and elected members of its
workforce. The Company believes that its relations with employees and their representative organizations are good.

Included
in the employees above are approximately 700 employees in the sugar confectionery business, the sale of which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2005.

In
January 2004, the Company announced a three-year restructuring program. Under this program, the Company anticipates the elimination of approximately 6,000
positions. Specific programs announced during 2004, as part of the overall restructuring program, will result in the elimination of approximately 3,500 positions.

Research and Development

The Company pursues four objectives in research and development: product safety and quality; growth through new products; superior consumer satisfaction; and
reduced costs.

The
Company's research and development resources include more than 2,000 food scientists, chemists and engineers, deployed primarily in five key technology centers: East Hanover, New
Jersey; Glenview, Illinois; Tarrytown, New York; Banbury, United Kingdom; and Munich, Germany. These technology centers are equipped with pilot plants and
state-of-the-art instruments. Research and development expense was $388 million in 2004, $374 million in 2003 and $354 million in 2002.

Trademarks and Intellectual Property

Trademarks are of material importance to the Company's businesses and are protected by registration or otherwise in the United States and most other markets where
the related products are sold. The Company has from time to time granted various parties exclusive or non-exclusive licenses to use one or more of its trademarks in particular locations.
The Company does not believe that these licensing arrangements have had a material effect on the conduct of its business or operating results.

Some
of the Company's products are sold under brands that have been licensed from others on terms that are generally renewable at the Company's discretion. These licensed brands include

Starbucks

bagged
coffee for sale in United States grocery stores and other distribution channels,

Capri
Sun

aseptic juice drinks for sale in North America,

Taco Bell Home Originals

Mexican style food products for sale in United
States grocery stores,

California Pizza Kitchen

frozen pizzas for sale in grocery stores in the United States and Canada,

Pebbles

ready-to-eat cereals,

Tazo

teas for sale in grocery stores in the United
States, and

Seattle's Best

coffee and

Torrefazione Italia

coffee for sale in United States grocery
stores and other distribution channels.

Similarly,
the Company owns thousands of patents worldwide, and the patent portfolio as a whole is material to the Company's business; however, no one patent or group of related patents
is material to the Company. In addition, the Company has proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.


Seasonality

Demand for certain of the Company's products may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other annual events. Due to the offsetting nature of demands for
the Company's diversified product portfolio, however, sales of the Company's products are generally evenly balanced throughout the year.

Environmental Regulation

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise
related to environmental protection, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as "Superfund"), which imposes joint and several liability on each responsible party. In 2004, subsidiaries of the Company were involved in 93 active Superfund
and other actions in the United States related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which the Company retains liability.

Outside
the United States, the Company is subject to applicable multi-national, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the host countries in which the Company does
business. The Company has specific programs across its international business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements.

Although
it is not possible to predict precisely the estimated costs for environmental-related expenditures, compliance with such laws and regulations, including the payment of any
remediation costs and the making of such expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, capital expenditures, financial
position, earnings, cash flows or competitive position.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in the Company's filings
with the SEC, in its reports to shareholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. One can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as "strategy," "expects," "plans,"
"anticipates," "believes," "will,"
"continues," "estimates," "intends," "projects," "goals," "targets" and other words of similar meaning. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current
facts. The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although it believes that it has been prudent in its plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is
subject to risks, uncertainties, and the possibility of inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual
results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain
invested in the Company's securities. In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is hereby identifying important factors that
could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement made by or on behalf of the Company; any such statement is qualified by reference to
the following cautionary statements. The Company elaborates on these and other risks that it faces throughout this document, particularly in the "Business Environment" section preceding the discussion
of operating results. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, the following should not be considered a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time.

Each
of the Company's segments is subject to intense competition, changes in consumer preferences and demand for its products, including low-carbohydrate diet trends, the
effects of changing prices for its raw materials and local economic and market conditions. Their results are


dependent
upon their continued ability to promote brand equity successfully, to anticipate and respond to new consumer trends, to develop new products and markets, to broaden brand portfolios, to
compete effectively with lower priced products in a consolidating environment at the retail and manufacturing levels and to improve productivity. The Company's results are also dependent on its
ability to consummate and successfully integrate acquisitions and to realize the cost savings and improved asset utilization contemplated by its restructuring program. The Company may, from time to
time, divest businesses that are less of a strategic fit within its portfolio, and its results may be impacted by either the gains or losses, or lost operating income, from the sales of those
businesses. In addition, the Company is subject to the effects of foreign economies, currency movements, fluctuations in levels of customer inventories and credit and other business risks related to
its customers operating in a challenging economic and competitive environment. The Company's results are affected by its access to credit markets, borrowing costs and credit ratings, which may in turn
be influenced by the credit ratings of Altria Group, Inc. The Company's benefit expense is subject to the investment performance of pension plan assets, interest rates and cost increases for
medical benefits offered to employees and retirees. The Company's assessment of the fair value of its operations for purposes of assessing impairment of goodwill and intangibles is based on
discounting projections of future cash flows and is affected by the interest rate market and general economic and market conditions. The food industry continues to be subject to recalls if products
become adulterated or misbranded, liability if product consumption causes injury, ingredient disclosure and labeling laws and regulations and the possibility that consumers could lose confidence in
the safety and quality of certain food products. The food industry is also subject to concerns and/or regulations regarding genetically modified organisms and the health implications of obesity and
trans-fatty acids. Increased government regulation of the food industry could result in increased costs to the Company.

The
Company owns 181 and leases 11 of these manufacturing and processing facilities. All of the Company's plants and properties are maintained in good condition, and the Company believes
that they are suitable and adequate for its present needs.

Included
in the facilities above are sugar confectionery manufacturing facilities in Creston, IA, Chattanooga, TN, Brasov, Romania and Bridgend, United Kingdom that are part of the sale
of the sugar confectionery business that is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2005. Also included in the facilities above are facilities the closure or sale of which has been publicly
announced but has not yet been completed.

As
of December 31, 2004, the Company's distribution facilities consisted of 356 distribution centers and depots worldwide. In North America, the Company had 331 distribution
centers and depots, more than 75% of which support the Company's direct-store-delivery systems. Outside North America, the Company had 25 distribution centers in nine countries. The Company owns 52 of
these distribution centers and two of these depots and leases 148 of these distribution centers and 154 of these depots. The Company believes that all of these facilities are in good condition and
have sufficient capacity to meet the Company's distribution needs for the foreseeable future.

In
January 2004, the Company announced a three-year restructuring program. As part of this program, the Company anticipates the closing or sale of up to 20 plants. In
2004, the Company announced the closing of 13 plants as part of the restructuring program.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is party to a variety of legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business, including the matters discussed below. While the results of
litigation cannot be predicted with certainty,


management
believes that the final outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
October 2002, Mr. Mustapha Gaouar and five other family members (collectively "the Gaouars") filed suit in the Commercial Court of Casablanca against Kraft Foods Maroc
and Mr. Omar Berrada claiming damages of approximately $31 million arising from a non-compete undertaking signed by Mr. Gaouar allegedly under duress. The
non-compete clause was contained in an agreement concluded in 1986 between Mr. Gaouar and Mr. Berrada acting for himself and for his group of companies, including Les Cafes
Ennasr (renamed Kraft Foods Maroc), which was acquired by Kraft Foods International, Inc. from Mr. Berrada in 2001. In June 2003, the court issued a preliminary judgment against
Kraft Foods Maroc and Mr. Berrada holding that the Gaouars are entitled to damages for being deprived of the possibility of engaging in coffee roasting from 1986 due to such
non-compete undertaking. At that time, the court appointed two experts to assess the amount of damages to be awarded. In December 2003, these experts delivered a report concluding
that they could see no evidence of loss suffered by the Gaouars. The Gaouars asked the court that this report be set aside and new court experts be appointed. On April 15, 2004, the court
delivered a judgment upholding the defenses of Kraft Foods Maroc and rejecting the claims of the Gaouars. The Gaouars have appealed this judgment. The existence of the claims of Mr. Gaouar was
not disclosed by Mr. Berrada at the time of the Kraft Foods International, Inc. acquisition of Kraft Foods Maroc in 2001. As a result, in the event that the Company is ultimately found
liable on appeal for damages to plaintiff in this case, the Company believes that it may have claims against Mr. Berrada for recovery of all or a portion of the amount.

Environmental Matters

In May 2001, the State of Ohio notified the Company that it may be subject to an enforcement action for alleged past violations of the Company's wastewater
discharge permit at its production facility in Farmdale, Ohio. In December 2004, the Company finalized a monetary settlement with the State, which was approved by The Court of Common Pleas for
Trumball County on January 3, 2005. The settlement amount is not material to the Company.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Description of the Company

The Company manufactures and markets packaged food products, consisting principally of beverages, cheese, snacks, convenient meals and various packaged grocery
products. Kraft manages and reports operating results through two units, Kraft North America Commercial and Kraft International Commercial. Reportable segments for Kraft North America Commercial are
organized and managed principally by product category. Kraft International Commercial's operations are organized and managed by geographic location. At December 31, 2004, Altria
Group, Inc. held 98.0% of the combined voting power of Kraft's outstanding capital stock and owned 85.4% of the outstanding shares of Kraft's capital stock.

On
November 15, 2004, the Company announced the sale of substantially all of its sugar confectionery business for approximately $1.5 billion. The transaction, which is
subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2005. The Company has reflected the results of its sugar confectionery business as discontinued operations on the
consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented. Accordingly, historical statements of earnings amounts included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations have been restated to reflect the discontinued operation. The assets related to the sugar confectionery business were reflected as assets of discontinued operations held for sale on the
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004.

During
January 2004, the Company announced a new global organization structure, which resulted in new segments. During the fourth quarter of 2004, following the sale of its sugar
confectionery business, the Company realigned its North American segments. Kraft North America Commercial's new segments, which are reflected in this Management's Discussion and Analysis, are
U.S. Beverages; U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America Foodservice; U.S. Convenient Meals; U.S. Grocery; and U.S. Snacks & Cereals. Kraft International
Commercial's segments are Europe, Middle East & Africa; and Latin America & Asia Pacific. The new segment structure in North America reflects a shift of certain divisions and brands
between segments to more closely align these businesses to consumer sectors, to provide more focus on the separate beverage and grocery businesses, and to benefit from synergies in grain based
products. Historical data have been restated to reflect the new segment structure.

Executive Summary

The following executive summary is intended to provide significant highlights of the Discussion and Analysis that follows.

Consolidated Operating Results

—The changes in the Company's earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share
("EPS") from continuing operations for the year ended


December 31,
2004 from the year ended December 31, 2003 were due primarily to the following (in millions, except per share data):

See discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the Consolidated Operating Results section of the
following Discussion and Analysis.

The unfavorable impact of asset impairment, exit and implementation costs on net earnings and diluted EPS is due primarily to the following:

Restructuring Program

—In January 2004, the Company announced a three-year restructuring program. As part of
this program, the Company anticipates the closing or sale of up to twenty plants and the elimination of approximately six thousand positions. From 2004 through 2006, the Company expects to incur up to
$1.2 billion in pre-tax charges, reflecting asset disposals, severance and other implementation costs, including pre-tax charges of $641 million incurred in 2004.
Included in the $641 million are asset impairment and exit costs of $583 million for the restructuring program and $58 million of implementation costs associated with the
restructuring program, of which $8 million was included in loss from discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings.

In
November 2004, the Company completed a valuation of its equity investment in a joint venture in Turkey following the determination that a non-temporary decline in
value had occurred. This valuation resulted in a $47 million non-cash pre-tax charge.

For further details, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Business Environment section of the following Discussion and Analysis.

Lower Effective Income Tax Rate

—The Company's reported effective income tax rate decreased by 2.6 percentage points to 32.3%, resulting from an
$81 million favorable resolution of an outstanding tax item, the majority of which occurred in the third quarter of 2004, and the reversal of
$35 million of tax accruals that are no longer required due to tax events that occurred during the first quarter of 2004.

Currency

—The favorable currency impact on net earnings and diluted EPS is due primarily to the weakness of the U.S. dollar
versus the euro and the Canadian dollar.

Continuing Operations

—The decrease in results from continuing operations was due primarily to the following:

•

Lower
income at Kraft North America Commercial, reflecting higher commodity costs, increased promotional programs and higher benefit costs, partially offset by higher
pricing and favorable volume/mix.

•

Lower
income at Kraft International Commercial, reflecting higher costs, including benefits, promotional programs and commodity costs.


For further details, see the Consolidated Operating Results and Operating Results by Business Segment sections of the following Discussion and Analysis.

2005 Forecasted Results

—In January 2005, the Company announced that it expects 2005 full-year diluted EPS from net earnings in a
range of $1.60 to $1.65. This forecast includes anticipated charges of $0.18 for costs related to its restructuring program and $0.12 in one-time impacts upon completion of divestitures,
and reflects approximately $0.04 in ongoing dilution from divestitures. The Company also announced that it expects 2005 full-year diluted EPS on a continuing operations basis in a range of
$1.75 to $1.80. The factors described in the section entitled

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K represent continuing risks to these forecasts.

Discussion and Analysis

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the
Company's consolidated financial statements. In most instances, the Company must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").

The
preparation of all financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts included in the Company's financial statements, including, among
other things, employee benefit costs and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately
different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in the Company's consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Historically, the aggregate
differences, if any, between the Company's estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The
selection and disclosure of the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the Company's Audit Committee. The following is a review of the more
significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements:

Employee Benefit Plans.

As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company provides a range
of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits (primarily severance). The Company records amounts relating to
these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover
rates and health care cost trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed
appropriate to do so. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its
obligations under its plans, which are presented in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, are reasonable based on its experience and advice from its actuaries.


During
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded the following amounts in the consolidated statements of earnings for employee benefit plans:




(in millions)

U.S. pension plan cost (income)

$


$

)

$

(33

)

Non-U.S. pension plan cost




Postretirement health care cost




Postemployment benefit plan cost




Employee savings plan cost




Net expense for employee benefit plans

$


$


$


The 2004 net expense for employee benefit plans of $635 million increased by $288 million over the 2003 amount. This cost increase primarily relates
to increased postemployment benefit costs, resulting from several workforce reduction programs during 2004 as part of the overall restructuring program ($167 million), and a lowering of the
Company's discount rate assumption on its pension and postretirement benefit plans, partially offset by the impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003
discussed below. The 2003 net expense for employee benefit plans of $347 million increased by $17 million over the 2002 amount. This cost increase primarily relates to higher settlement
losses in the U.S. pension plan, a lowering of the Company's discount rate assumption on its pension and postretirement benefit plans, increased amortization of deferred losses, as well as higher
matching of employee contributions in the savings plan, partially offset by $148 million of costs in 2002 associated with voluntary early retirement and integration programs.

In
December 2003, the United States enacted into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). The Act establishes a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare, known as "Medicare Part D," and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare Part D.

In
May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position No. 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003" ("FSP 106-2"). FSP 106-2 requires companies to account for the effect of the subsidy on benefits
attributable to past service as an actuarial experience gain and as a reduction of the service cost component of net postretirement health care costs for amounts attributable to current service, if
the benefit provided is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D.

The
Company adopted FSP 106-2 in the third quarter of 2004. The impact of adoption for 2004 was a reduction of pre-tax net postretirement health care costs and an
increase in net earnings of $24 million. In addition, as of July 1, 2004, the Company reduced its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the subsidy related to benefits
attributed to past service by $315 million and decreased its unrecognized actuarial losses by the same amount.

At
December 31, 2004, for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans, the Company reduced its discount rate assumption from 6.25% to 5.75% and modified its health care cost trend
rate assumption. At December 31, 2004, the Company reduced its long-term rate of return assumption from 9.0% to 8.0% based on the investment return of its pension assets, which are
primarily in U.S. equity securities. The Company presently anticipates that these assumption changes, coupled with the amortization of lower returns on pension fund assets in prior years, partially
offset by the full year effect of adopting Medicare Part D, will result in an increase in 2005 pre-tax benefit expense of approximately $200 million, or approximately $0.08
per share. The expected increase in benefit expense is prior to the consideration of any impact of the three-year restructuring program announced in January 2004. While the Company
does not presently anticipate a change in its 2005 assumptions, a fifty-basis point decline (increase) in the Company's discount rate would increase (decrease) the Company's pension and postretirement


expense
by approximately $65 million. Similarly, a fifty-basis point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) the Company's pension expense for the
U.S. pension plans by approximately $31 million. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates.

Revenue Recognition.

As required by U.S. GAAP, the Company recognizes revenues, net of sales incentives, and including
shipping and handling charges billed to customers, upon shipment of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers. Shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales. Provisions
and allowances for estimated sales returns and bad debts are also recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The amounts recorded for these provisions and related allowances are not
significant to the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Depreciation, Amortization and Goodwill Valuation.

The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment and amortizes
definite life intangibles using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

The
Company is required to conduct an annual review of goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment. Goodwill impairment testing requires a comparison between the carrying
value and fair value of each reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the
carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined using discounted cash flows. Impairment testing for non-amortizable intangible assets requires a comparison between
fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. These calculations may be
affected by the market conditions noted below in the Business Environment section, as well as interest rates and general economic conditions. During 2004, the Company completed its annual review of
goodwill and intangible assets. This review resulted in a $29 million non-cash pre-tax charge related to intangible asset impairments for a small confectionery business
in the United States and certain brands in Mexico. A portion of this
charge, $12 million, was recorded as asset impairment and exit costs on the consolidated statement of earnings. The remainder of the charge, $17 million, is included in discontinued
operations.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

The Company reviews long-lived assets, including amortizable
intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company performs undiscounted
operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, the Company groups assets and liabilities at
the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets
to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

Marketing and Advertising Costs.

As required by U.S. GAAP, the Company records marketing costs as an expense in the year to
which such costs relate. The Company does not defer amounts on its year-end consolidated balance sheet with respect to marketing costs. The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period, based principally
on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated
volume and related expense for the full year.

Related Party Transactions.

As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Altria
Group, Inc.'s subsidiary, Altria Corporate Services, Inc., provides the Company with various services, including planning, legal, treasury, accounting, auditing, insurance, human
resources, office of the secretary, corporate affairs, information technology, aviation and tax services. Billings for these services,


which
were based on the cost to Altria Corporate Services, Inc. to provide such services and a management fee, were $310 million, $318 million and $327 million for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These costs were paid to Altria Corporate Services, Inc. monthly. Although the cost of these services cannot be quantified on
a stand-alone basis, management has assessed that the billings are reasonable based on the level of support provided by Altria Corporate Services, Inc., and that they reflect all services
provided. The cost and nature of the services are reviewed annually by the Company's Audit Committee, which is comprised of independent directors. The effects of these transactions are included in
operating cash flows in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows.

In
December 2004, the Company purchased two corporate aircraft from Altria Corporate Services, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $47 million. The
Company also entered into an Aircraft Management Agreement with Altria Corporate Services, Inc. in
December 2004, pursuant to which Altria Corporate Services, Inc. agreed to perform aircraft management, pilot services, maintenance and other aviation services for the Company.

During
2004, Altria Corporate Services, Inc. provided to the Company certain financial services, including payroll and accounts payable processing, at a cost of approximately
$25 million, which was included in the $310 million charge shown above. Beginning in 2005, the Company will perform these functions for itself at a similar cost.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had short-term amounts payable to Altria Group, Inc. of $227 million and $543 million, respectively.
Interest on these borrowings is based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate.

Income Taxes.

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The accounts of the Company are included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Altria Group, Inc. Income taxes are generally computed
on a separate company basis. To the extent that foreign tax credits, capital losses and other credits generated by the Company, which cannot currently be utilized on a separate company basis, are
utilized in Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated federal income tax return, the benefit is recognized in the calculation of the Company's provision for income taxes. Based on the Company's current
estimate, this benefit is calculated to be approximately $70 million, $100 million and $240 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
benefit is dependent on a variety of tax attributes that have a tendency to vary year to year. The Company makes payments to, or is reimbursed by, Altria Group, Inc. for the tax effects
resulting from its inclusion in Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated federal income tax return. The provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates and
tax planning opportunities available to the Company in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.
The Company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that existing tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that are likely to be
challenged and that may not be sustained on review by tax authorities. The Company adjusts these additional accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances. The consolidated tax provision
includes the impact of changes to accruals that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest. If the Company's filing positions are ultimately upheld under audits by respective
taxing authorities, it is possible that the provision for income taxes in future years may reflect favorable adjustments.

On
October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act ("the Jobs Act") was signed into law. The Jobs Act provides for a deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated. The Company may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in 2005 and is conducting analyses of its effects. The U.S. Treasury Department recently provided
additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision, which is under consideration as part of the Company's evaluation. The


Company
expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time. The Company does not expect the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act to
have a significant impact on its consolidated results of operations or its consolidated cash flows.

The
Jobs Act also provides tax relief to U.S. domestic manufacturers by providing a tax deduction of up to 9% of the lesser of "qualified production activities income" or taxable income.
In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109-1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 109, 'Accounting for Income Taxes,' to the Tax Deduction on Qualified
Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP 109-1"). FSP 109-1 requires companies to account for this deduction as a "special deduction"
rather than a rate reduction, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, and therefore, the Company will recognize these benefits, which are not expected to be significant, in the year earned.

Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include Kraft Foods Inc., as well as its wholly-owned and
majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which Kraft Foods Inc. exercises significant influence (20%—50% ownership interest), are accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Investments in which Kraft Foods Inc. has an ownership interest of less than 20%, or does not exercise significant influence, are accounted for with the cost method of accounting.
All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Business Environment

The Company is subject to a number of challenges that may adversely affect its businesses. These challenges, which are discussed below and under the
"Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements" section in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, include:

•

fluctuations
in commodity prices;

•

movements
of foreign currencies;

•

competitive
challenges in various products and markets, including price gaps with competitor products and the increasing price-consciousness of consumers;

•

a
rising cost environment;

•

a
trend toward increasing consolidation in the retail trade and consequent pricing pressure and inventory reductions;

•

a
growing presence of hard discount retailers, primarily in Europe, with an emphasis on own-label products;

•

changing
consumer preferences, including diet trends;

•

competitors
with different profit objectives and less susceptibility to currency exchange rates; and

•

concerns
and/or regulations regarding food safety, quality and health, including genetically modified organisms, trans-fatty acids and obesity. Increased government
regulation of the food industry could result in increased costs to the Company.

Fluctuations
in commodity prices can lead to retail price volatility and intense price competition, and can influence consumer and trade buying patterns. During 2004, the Company's
commodity costs on average have been higher than those incurred in 2003 (most notably dairy, coffee, meat, nuts, energy and packaging), and have adversely affected earnings. Dairy costs rose to
historical highs during the first half of 2004, but have moderated during the second half of 2004. For 2004, the Company had a negative pre-tax impact from all commodities of approximately
$930 million as compared with 2003.

In
the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers, including the timing of holidays and other annual or
special events, seasonality of certain products, significant weather conditions, timing of Company and customer


incentive
programs, customer inventory programs, Company initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency, including efforts to align product shipments more closely with consumption by shifting some of
its customer marketing programs to a consumption based approach, financial situations of customers and general economic conditions.

To
build its business while confronting these challenges, the Company operates with seven business strategies: 1) build superior consumer brand value; 2) build shopper
demand through superior customer collaboration; 3) transform the portfolio; 4) expand global scale; 5) drive out costs and assets; 6) strengthen employee and organizational
excellence; and 7) act responsibly.

The
first strategy—to build superior consumer brand value—involves improving the Company's products, using more value-added packaging, developing innovative new
products and managing price gaps effectively. During 2004, the Company increased marketing spending by approximately $460 million versus 2003 to manage price gaps, to increase media presence,
to drive growth, to enhance brand equity and to support new products.

The
second strategy—to build shopper demand through superior customer collaboration—recognizes the importance of the Company's retail partners in fulfilling its
vision. The Company works together with its customers to better understand consumer behavior in their stores, to develop in-store programs that increase shopper demand, and to reduce costs
through more efficient store delivery systems.

The
third strategy is to transform the portfolio. Through innovation, investment, acquisition and divestiture, the Company is accelerating the shift in its portfolio toward
businesses—whether global, regional or local—that offer the Company a sustainable competitive advantage, and will better enable its management to focus on opportunities that
meet consumer needs and create long-term value for the Company.

In
particular, the Company is responding to growing consumer demand for products that meet health and wellness and convenience needs. The Company is enhancing the nutrition profile of
its portfolio by creating new products and by reformulating existing products, including reducing or eliminating trans-fat wherever possible. The Company is addressing convenience needs by
offering more convenient packaging, such as single-serve and resealable packaging, and products requiring reduced preparation.

The
fourth strategy—to expand the Company's global scale—focuses on improving its growth prospects in key developing markets that offer the greatest growth
potential. In particular, the Company is expanding its marketing and infrastructure investments in large, growing markets, such as China, Brazil, Mexico and Russia.

The
fifth strategy—to drive out costs and assets—includes the Company's announced three-year restructuring program, with the objectives of realigning
and lowering its cost structure and optimizing capacity utilization. As part of this program (which is discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company
anticipates the closing or sale of up to twenty plants and the elimination of approximately six thousand positions. From 2004 through 2006, the Company expects to incur up to $1.2 billion in
pre-tax charges, reflecting asset disposals, severance and other implementation costs, including $641 million incurred in 2004. Approximately one-half of the
pre-tax charges are expected to require cash payments.

In
addition, the Company expects to incur approximately $140 million in capital expenditures from 2004 through 2006 to implement the restructuring program, including
$46 million spent in 2004. Cost savings as a result of the restructuring program were approximately $127 million in 2004, are expected to increase by an incremental amount between
$120 million and $140 million in 2005, and are anticipated to reach annualized cost savings of approximately $400 million by 2006, all of which are expected to be used in
supporting brand-building initiatives.


The
sixth strategy—to strengthen employee and organizational excellence—reflects the need to develop organizational capabilities and support employees in meeting
the Company's business challenges, wherever they work. In this regard, during 2004 the Company completed a reorganization and resource alignment for a new global structure. In addition, a new vision
for the organization—to help people around the world eat and live better—was introduced, while human resource policies, processes and practices were harmonized across the
Company.

The
final strategy is to act responsibly. As the Company strives for sustainable growth, it seeks business success in ways that honor ethical and legal standards and that respect people,
communities and the natural environment. This strategy includes a commitment to strong compliance and integrity programs and sound corporate governance, as well as a number of health and wellness
initiatives, such as enhanced nutrition labeling, the development and funding of community-based programs and voluntary limitations on advertising to younger children. It also includes taking steps to
contribute to the sustainability of the Company's agricultural supply base through several programs with respected international and local partners. The Company outlines its
commitment to corporate responsibility in the Kraft Code of Conduct for employees and at www.kraft.com/responsibility/home.aspx.

Acquisitions and Dispositions:

One element of the third strategy is to strengthen the Company's brand portfolios through disciplined programs of selective acquisitions and divestitures. The
Company is constantly reviewing potential acquisition candidates and from time to time sells businesses to accelerate the shift in its portfolio toward businesses—whether global, regional
or local—that offer the Company a sustainable competitive advantage. The impact of any future acquisition or divestiture could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On
November 15, 2004, the Company announced the sale of substantially all of its sugar confectionery business for approximately $1.5 billion. The proposed sale includes the

Life Savers

,

Creme Savers

,

Altoids

,

Trolli

and

Sugus

brands. The
transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be
completed in the second quarter of 2005. The Company has reflected the results of its sugar confectionery business as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of earnings for all years
presented. The assets related to the sugar confectionery business were reflected as assets of discontinued operations held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004. In
addition, the Company anticipates additional tax expense of approximately $270 million to be recorded as a loss on sale of discontinued operations in 2005. In accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 109, the tax expense will be recorded when the transaction is consummated.

During
2004, the Company acquired a U.S.-based beverage business for a total cost of $137 million. During 2003, the Company acquired a biscuits business in Egypt and trademarks
associated with a small U.S.-based natural foods business. The total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $98 million. During 2002, the Company acquired a snacks business in Turkey
and a biscuits business in Australia. The total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $122 million.

During
2004, the Company sold a Brazilian snack nuts business and trademarks associated with a candy business in Norway. The aggregate proceeds received from the sale of these businesses
were $18 million, on which pre-tax losses of $3 million were recorded. In December 2004, the Company announced the sale of its U.K. desserts business for approximately
$135 million, which is expected to result in an estimated gain of $0.04 per share. The transaction closed in the first quarter of 2005. The Company also announced in December 2004, the
sale of its yogurt business for approximately $59 million, which is expected to result in an after-tax loss of approximately $12 million ($5 million in 2004, with the
remainder at closing). The transaction, which is also subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005.


During
2003, the Company sold a European rice business and a branded fresh cheese business in Italy. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses were $96 million, on
which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $31 million.

During
2002, the Company sold several small North American food businesses, some of which had been previously classified as businesses held for sale arising from the acquisition of
Nabisco. In addition, the Company sold its Latin American yeast and industrial bakery ingredients business for approximately $110 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of
$69 million. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses were $219 million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $80 million.

The
operating results of the businesses acquired and sold, excluding the sugar confectionery business, were not material to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.

As discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's management uses operating companies income, which is defined as operating
income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help
investors analyze the business performance and trends of the various business segments.

2004 compared with 2003

The following discussion compares consolidated operating results for 2004 with 2003.

Volume
increased 509 million pounds (2.8%), due primarily to acquisitions and increased shipments in the U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America Foodservice segment, partially
offset by the impact of divested businesses.

Net
revenues increased $1,670 million (5.5%), due primarily to favorable currency ($838 million), higher volume/mix ($560 million), higher net pricing
($265 million, reflecting commodity-driven pricing, partially offset by increased promotional spending) and the impact of acquisitions ($140 million), partially offset by the impact of
divested businesses ($126 million).

Operating
income decreased $1,248 million (21.3%), due primarily to the pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($597 million), unfavorable costs,
net of higher pricing ($442 million, due primarily to higher commodity costs and increased promotional spending), higher marketing, administration and research costs ($306 million), the
2004 implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($50 million), the 2004 equity investment impairment charge relating to a joint venture in Turkey ($47 million), the
unfavorable net impact related to gains and losses on the sales of businesses ($34 million), higher fixed manufacturing costs ($23 million, including higher benefit costs) and the impact
of divestitures ($18 million), partially offset by higher volume/mix ($187 million) and favorable currency ($98 million).

Currency
movements increased net revenues by $838 million and operating income by $98 million. These increases were due primarily to the weakness of the U.S. dollar against
the euro and the Canadian dollar.

The
Company's reported effective income tax rate decreased by 2.6 percentage points to 32.3%, resulting from an $81 million favorable resolution of an outstanding tax item,
the majority of which occurred in the third quarter of 2004, and the reversal of $35 million of tax accruals that are no longer required due to tax events that occurred during the first quarter
of 2004.

Earnings
from continuing operations of $2,669 million decreased $710 million (21.0%), due primarily to lower operating income, partially offset by a lower effective income
tax rate. Diluted EPS from continuing operations, which was $1.55, decreased by 20.5%.

Earnings
from discontinued operations, net of income tax, decreased $101 million, resulting in a net loss of $4 million in 2004. The decrease was due primarily to
pre-tax non-cash asset impairment charges in 2004 of $107 million ($69 million after-tax) and an intangible pre-tax asset impairment
charge of $17 million ($11 million after-tax).

Net
earnings of $2,665 million decreased $811 million (23.3%). Diluted EPS from net earnings, which was $1.55, decreased by 22.9%.

2003 compared with 2002

The following discussion compares consolidated operating results for 2003 with 2002.

Volume
increased 139 million pounds (0.8%), due primarily to increased shipments in the U.S. Beverages segment and the U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America
Foodservice segment, growth


in
developing markets and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of divested businesses, lower consumption in certain categories, particularly U.S. cookies, trade inventory
reductions, price competition and the impact of a weaker global economy.

Net
revenues increased $1,250 million (4.3%), due to favorable currency ($726 million), higher pricing ($477 million, reflecting higher commodity and currency
devaluation-driven cost increases, partially offset by higher promotional spending), higher volume/mix ($75 million) and the impact of acquisitions ($59 million), partially offset by the
impact of divested businesses ($87 million).

Operating
income decreased $101 million (1.7%), due primarily to higher fixed manufacturing costs ($113 million, including higher benefit costs), higher marketing,
administration and research costs ($106 million), unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($77 million, due primarily to higher commodity costs and increased promotional spending),
unfavorable volume/mix ($74 million), the impact of gains on sales of businesses ($49 million) and the impact of divestitures ($18 million), partially offset by the impact of
lower pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($136 million) and the impact from integration costs and a loss on sale of a food factory ($124 million) and
favorable currency ($93 million). The higher benefit costs were primarily related to pension and stock compensation costs.

Currency
movements increased net revenues by $726 million and operating income by $93 million. These increases were due primarily to the weakening of the U.S. dollar
against the euro, the Canadian dollar and other currencies, partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar against certain Latin American currencies.

Interest
and other debt expense, net, decreased $182 million. This decrease is due to the Company's refinancing of notes payable to Altria Group, Inc. and the use of free
cash flow to pay down debt.

The
Company's reported effective income tax rate decreased by 0.6 percentage points to 34.9%, due primarily to rate differences from foreign operations.

Earnings
from continuing operations of $3,379 million increased $82 million (2.5%), due primarily to lower interest expense and a lower effective income tax rate, partially
offset by lower operating income. Diluted EPS from continuing operations, which was $1.95, increased by 2.6%.

Net
earnings of $3,476 million increased $82 million (2.4%). Diluted EPS from net earnings, which was $2.01, increased by 2.6%.

2004 compared with 2003

The following discussion compares Kraft North America Commercial's operating results for 2004 with 2003.

Volume
increased 4.3%, due primarily to an acquisition in the U.S. Beverages segment and increased shipments in the U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America Foodservice segment.

Net
revenues increased $1,123 million (5.4%), due primarily to higher volume/mix ($537 million), higher net pricing ($312 million, reflecting commodity-driven price
increases, partially offset by
increased promotional spending), favorable currency ($164 million) and the impact of acquisitions ($117 million).

Operating
companies income decreased $788 million (16.9%), due primarily to the 2004 pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($391 million),
unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($356 million, including higher commodity costs and increased promotional spending), higher marketing, administration and research costs
($214 million, including higher benefit costs) and the 2004 implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($40 million), partially offset by higher volume/mix
($197 million) and favorable currency ($29 million).


The
following discusses operating results within each of Kraft North America Commercial's reportable segments.

U.S. Beverages.

Volume increased 12.7%, due primarily to the 2004 acquisition of a beverage business
and new product introductions in refreshment beverages. In coffee, volume also increased, due to product quality improvements and the impact of an expanded distribution arrangement.

Net
revenues increased $122 million (5.0%), due primarily to the impact of acquisitions ($94 million) and higher volume/mix ($85 million), partially offset by
increased promotional spending ($56 million).

Operating
companies income decreased $151 million (24.0%), due primarily to higher marketing, administration and research costs ($98 million), unfavorable costs and higher
promotional spending ($85 million, including higher commodity costs), the 2004 pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($9 million) and the 2004 implementation
costs associated with the restructuring program ($4 million), partially offset by higher volume/mix ($49 million).

U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America Foodservice.

Volume increased 3.5%, due primarily to
higher volume in foodservice and cheese. Volume in the foodservice business increased, due primarily to an acquisition of a beverage business in 2004 and higher shipments to national accounts. Cheese
volume also increased, benefiting from increased promotional spending.

Net
revenues increased $704 million (10.5%), due primarily to higher volume/mix ($272 million), higher pricing, net of higher promotional reinvestment spending in cheese
($248 million, reflecting commodity-driven pricing), favorable currency ($164 million) and the impact of acquisitions.

Operating
companies income decreased $282 million (22.2%), due primarily to unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($214 million, including higher commodity costs and
increased promotional spending), the 2004 pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($111 million), higher fixed manufacturing costs ($50 million, including higher
benefit costs), higher marketing, administration and research costs ($26 million) and the 2004 implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($8 million), partially
offset by higher volume/mix ($99 million) and favorable currency ($29 million).

U.S. Convenient Meals.

Volume increased 1.6%, due primarily to gains in meats and pizza, partially
offset by lower shipments in meals. Meats volume increased driven by higher consumption of cold cuts, supported by higher investment spending. Pizza volume also increased, aided by new product
introductions. In meals, volume declined due to the discontinuation of certain product lines in the second half of 2003.

Net
revenues increased $192 million (4.7%), due primarily to higher volume/mix ($114 million), higher pricing ($75 million, reflecting commodity-driven pricing in
meats and pizza) and the impact of acquisitions.

Operating
companies income decreased $46 million (5.6%), due primarily to the 2004 pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($41 million), higher
marketing, administration and research costs ($38 million, including higher benefit costs), the impact of acquisitions ($5 million) and the 2004 implementation costs associated with the
restructuring program ($4 million), partially offset by higher volume/mix ($40 million) and higher pricing, net of unfavorable costs ($7 million, including higher commodity
costs).

U.S. Grocery.

Volume increased 0.7%, due primarily to gains in enhancers, partially offset by a
decline in desserts. Volume increased in enhancers, due primarily to mayonnaise and salad dressings. In desserts, volume declined, due primarily to lower shipments of fruit snacks, partially offset by
higher shipments in frozen toppings.


Net
revenues increased $37 million (1.5%), due primarily to higher pricing and lower promotional spending ($34 million) and higher volume/mix.

Operating
companies income was equal to the prior year, as lower fixed manufacturing costs ($17 million) and higher volume/mix ($10 million) were offset by the 2004
pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($8 million), the 2004 implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($6 million), higher marketing,
administration and research costs ($5 million) and unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing.

U.S. Snacks & Cereals.

Volume increased 1.5%, as higher salted snacks and biscuits volume was
partially offset by a decline in cereals. Salted snacks volume increased due to consumer nutrition trends and marketing programs in nuts. In biscuits, volume increased, driven by new product
introductions. In cereals, volume declined due to low carbohydrate diet trends, which impacted the category, and increased competitive activity.

Net
revenues increased $68 million (1.3%), due primarily to higher volume/mix ($62 million) and higher pricing ($11 million, including the absence of high product
returns associated with new products incurred in the prior year, partially offset by increased promotional spending).

Operating
companies income decreased $309 million (29.5%), due primarily to the 2004 pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($222 million),
unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($62 million, due to higher commodity costs and increased promotional spending), higher marketing, administration and research costs
($47 million) and the 2004 implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($18 million), partially offset by lower fixed manufacturing costs ($40 million).

2003 compared with 2002

The following discussion compares Kraft North America Commercial's operating results for 2003 with 2002.

Volume
increased 1.5%, due primarily to contributions from new products and increased shipments in the U.S. Beverages segment and the U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America
Foodservice segment, partially offset by the divestiture of a small confectionery business in 2002, consumption weakness in certain categories, primarily cookies, and trade inventory reductions.

Net
revenues increased $448 million (2.2%), due primarily to favorable currency ($162 million), higher pricing, net of increased promotional spending ($157 million)
and higher volume/mix ($148 million), partially offset by the divestiture of a small confectionery business in 2002 ($21 million).

Operating
companies income decreased $6 million (0.1%), due primarily to unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($132 million, including higher commodity costs and
increased promotional spending), higher fixed manufacturing costs ($82 million, including higher benefit costs) and unfavorable volume/mix ($35 million), partially offset by 2002
pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($135 million) and the impact of lower integration costs and a loss on sale of a food factory ($107 million).

The
following discusses operating results within each of Kraft North America Commercial's reportable segments.

U.S. Beverages.

ready-to-drink beverages, which were aided by new product introductions. In coffee, volume declined, impacted by competitive activity and a category decline due to higher
prices.

Net
revenues increased $95 million (4.1%), due to higher volume/mix ($82 million) and lower promotional spending, net of lower pricing ($13 million).

Operating
companies income increased $54 million (9.4%), due primarily to the impact of lower integration costs ($58 million), higher volume/mix ($33 million) and

administration and research costs ($27 million) and higher benefit costs.

U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America Foodservice.

Volume increased 2.3%, due primarily to
higher shipments in cheese, foodservice and Canada. Cheese volume increased due primarily to improved consumption and share trends resulting from the investment program that began in the third quarter
of 2003. Volume for the foodservice business in the United States also increased, due to higher shipments to national accounts. Volume in Canada increased, driven by new beverage product
introductions.

Net
revenues increased $317 million (5.0%), due to favorable currency ($162 million), higher volume/mix ($119 million) and higher pricing ($36 million,
including the impact of increased promotional spending).

Operating

currency ($32 million), higher volume/mix ($21 million) and lower integration costs ($8 million), partially offset by unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($49 million,
including higher commodity costs and increased promotional spending), higher marketing, administration and research costs ($20 million) and higher fixed manufacturing costs ($18 million,
including higher benefit costs).

partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs ($53 million) and higher benefit costs.

U.S. Grocery.

Volume decreased 0.6%, due primarily to the divestiture of a small confectionery
business in 2002 and a decline in enhancers, partially offset by higher shipments in desserts. In enhancers, volume declined due primarily to lower shipments of spoonable dressings, partially offset
by gains in pourable dressings, barbeque sauce and steak sauce. In desserts, volume increased due primarily to higher shipments of sugar-free items and increased merchandising programs.

Net
revenues increased $32 million (1.4%), due primarily to favorable volume/mix ($29 million) and higher pricing ($24 million, including the impact of increased
promotional spending), partially offset by the divestiture of a small confectionery business in 2002 ($21 million).

a small confectionery business in 2002 ($8 million) and higher benefit costs.

U.S. Snacks & Cereals.

biscuits, volume declined, due primarily to reduced consumption in cookies, reflecting higher pricing, lower impact of new products, and consumer health and wellness concerns. Snacks volume increased,
benefiting from category and consumption gains in snack nuts.


Net
revenues decreased $80 million (1.5%), due to lower volume/mix ($105 million), partially offset by higher pricing ($25 million, including the impact of increased
promotional spending).

2004 compared with 2003

The following discussion compares Kraft International Commercial's operating results for 2004 with 2003.

Volume
decreased 1.1%, due primarily to the impact of the divestiture of a rice business and a branded fresh cheese business in Europe in 2003, as well as price competition and trade
inventory reductions in several markets, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions.

Net
revenues increased $547 million (5.7%), due primarily to favorable currency ($674 million), the impact of acquisitions ($23 million) and favorable volume/mix
($23 million), partially offset by the
impact of divestitures ($126 million) and increased promotional spending, net of higher pricing ($47 million).

Operating
companies income decreased $460 million (33.0%), due primarily to the pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($206 million), unfavorable
costs and increased promotional spending, net of higher pricing ($113 million), higher marketing, administration and research costs ($92 million, including higher benefit costs and
infrastructure investment in developing markets), the 2004 equity investment impairment charge relating to a joint venture in Turkey ($47 million), the unfavorable net impact related to gains
and losses on the sales of businesses ($34 million), the impact of divestitures ($18 million) and the 2004 implementation costs associated with the restructuring program
($10 million), partially offset by favorable currency ($69 million).


The following discusses operating results within each of Kraft International Commercial's reportable segments.

Europe, Middle East & Africa.

Volume decreased 1.3%, due primarily to the divestiture of a
rice business and a branded fresh cheese business in Europe in 2003, price competition in France and trade inventory reductions in Russia, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions and volume
growth in Germany, Austria, Italy and Romania. Cheese volume declined, impacted by the divestiture of a branded fresh cheese business in Europe in 2003, partially offset by increased cream cheese
shipments in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, and higher process cheese shipments in the United Kingdom. Beverages volume also declined, driven by price competition in coffee in France and lower
shipments of refreshment beverages in the Middle East. Convenient meals volume declined, impacted by the divestiture of a rice business in Europe in 2003. In grocery, volume declined across several
markets, including Germany and Italy, partially offset by increased volume in Egypt, due to an acquisition. Snacks volume increased, as gains in biscuits, benefiting from acquisitions, and new
confectionery product introductions across the segment, were partially offset by trade inventory reductions in Russia.

Net
revenues increased $508 million (7.2%), due primarily to favorable currency ($649 million), favorable volume/mix ($48 million) and the impact of acquisitions
($21 million), partially offset by the impact of divestitures ($115 million) and lower pricing and increased promotional spending ($95 million).

Operating
companies income decreased $319 million (31.8%), due primarily to the pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($174 million), lower
pricing and increased promotional spending ($92 million), higher marketing, administration and research costs ($49 million, including higher benefit costs as well as infrastructure
investment in developing markets), the equity investment impairment charge relating to a joint venture in Turkey ($47 million), lower gains on the sales of businesses ($26 million), the
impact of divestitures ($17 million) and the 2004 implementation costs associated with the restructuring program ($9 million), partially offset by favorable currency ($78 million)
and favorable volume/mix ($15 million).

Latin America & Asia Pacific.

Volume decreased 1.0%, due primarily to lower shipments in
Mexico, Peru and Venezuela, partially offset by growth in Brazil and China. Snacks volume declined, impacted by price competition and trade inventory reductions in Venezuela and Peru. In grocery,
volume declined across several markets, including Peru, Australia and the Philippines. Cheese volume increased, due primarily to gains across several markets, including Japan, Australia and the
Philippines. Beverages volume also increased, due primarily to gains in Brazil and China, partially offset by increased competitive activity in Mexico.

Net
revenues increased $39 million (1.5%), due primarily to higher pricing ($48 million, reflecting devaluation-driven cost increases, net of increased promotional
spending) and favorable currency ($25 million), partially offset by lower volume/mix ($25 million) and the impact of divestitures ($11 million).

Operating
companies income decreased $141 million (36.1%), due primarily to higher marketing, administration and research costs ($43 million), the 2004 pre-tax
charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($32 million), lower volume/mix ($25 million), unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($21 million, including increased promotional
spending), unfavorable currency ($9 million) and the 2004 pre-tax loss on the sale of a snack nuts business in Brazil ($8 million).

2003 compared with 2002

The following discussion compares Kraft International Commercial's operating results for 2003 with 2002.


Volume
decreased 1.1%, due to the divestiture of a Latin American bakery ingredients business in 2002 and a rice business and a branded fresh cheese business in Europe in 2003, the
impact of price competition, particularly in Germany and France, and the adverse impact of a summer heat wave across Europe on the chocolate and coffee businesses. These declines were partially offset
by growth in developing markets, including Russia, Brazil, Mexico and China, and the acquisitions of a snacks business in Turkey and a biscuits business in Egypt.

Net
revenues increased $802 million (9.2%), due primarily to favorable currency ($564 million), higher pricing ($320 million, reflecting higher commodity and
currency devaluation-driven cost increases in Latin America) and the impact of acquisitions ($57 million), partially offset by lower volume/mix ($73 million) and the impact of
divestitures ($66 million).

Operating
companies income decreased $73 million (5.0%), due primarily to higher marketing, administration and research costs ($90 million, including higher benefit costs
and infrastructure investment in developing markets), the net impact of lower gains on sales of businesses ($41 million), lower volume/mix ($39 million) and the impact of divestitures
($13 million), partially offset by favorable currency ($61 million), higher pricing, net of cost increases ($24 million, including fixed
manufacturing costs), the 2002 pre-tax charges for integration costs ($17 million) and the impact of acquisitions ($7 million).

The
following discusses operating results within each of Kraft International Commercial's reportable segments.

Europe, Middle East & Africa.

Volume increased 0.3%, due to growth in the Central and Eastern
Europe, Middle East & Africa region, which benefited from the acquisition of a biscuits business in Egypt in 2003, as well as a snacks business acquisition in Turkey during the third quarter of
2002, and new product introductions. These gains were partially offset by the impact of the summer heat wave across Europe on the chocolate and coffee businesses, price competition in Germany and
France, and the divestiture of a rice business and a branded fresh cheese business in Europe in 2003. In snacks, volume increased in biscuits and salted snacks, benefiting from acquisitions, partially
offset by lower confectionery volume due to the summer heat wave across Europe and price competition. In beverages, volume declined, due primarily to the summer heat wave across Europe (which had an
adverse impact on coffee shipments) and price competition. These declines were partially offset by increased coffee shipments in Russia, benefiting from expanded distribution, and Poland, aided by new
product introductions. Convenient meals volume also declined, due to the divestiture of a rice business in Europe, partially offset by higher shipments of canned meats in Italy. Cheese volume
declined, due primarily to the impact of price competition in Germany and Spain, partially offset by gains in cream cheese in Italy.

Net
revenues increased $840 million (13.6%), due primarily to favorable currency ($804 million), the impact of acquisitions ($57 million) and higher pricing
($18 million), partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix ($41 million).

Operating
companies income increased $49 million (5.1%), due primarily to favorable currency ($100 million) and the gain on the sale of a rice business and a branded fresh
cheese business in Europe ($31 million), partially offset by unfavorable costs, net of higher pricing ($40 million, including higher commodity costs and increased promotional spending),
unfavorable volume/mix ($26 million) and higher marketing, administration and research costs ($19 million, including higher benefit costs and infrastructure investment in eastern
Europe).

Latin America & Asia Pacific.

Volume decreased 3.0%, due to the divestiture of a Latin
American bakery ingredients business in 2002, partially offset by growth in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Australia and China. In grocery, volume declined in Latin America, due primarily to the sale of a
bakery ingredients business in the fourth quarter of 2002. In beverages, volume increased due primarily to growth in Brazil,


Mexico,
Venezuela, and China, aided by new product introductions. Snacks volume also increased, as biscuits volume growth in Brazil, Argentina, China and Australia, aided by new product introductions,
was partially offset by a decline in confectionery, which was impacted by economic weakness, trade inventory reductions and price competition in Brazil. In cheese, volume increased, due to higher
shipments in Asia Pacific, benefiting from new products in Australia and promotional programs in the Philippines, partially offset by declines in Latin America. In convenient meals, volume grew,
benefiting from gains in Argentina.

Net
revenues decreased $38 million (1.5%), due primarily to unfavorable currency ($240 million), the divestiture of a Latin American bakery ingredients business in 2002
($68 million) and lower volume/mix ($32 million), partially offset by higher pricing ($302 million, reflecting higher commodity and currency devaluation-driven costs).

Operating
companies income decreased $122 million (23.8%), due primarily to gains on sales of businesses in 2002 ($72 million), higher marketing, administration and
research costs ($71 million), unfavorable currency ($39 million), lower volume/mix ($13 million) and the divestiture of a Latin American bakery ingredients business in 2002
($10 million), partially offset by higher pricing, net of cost increases ($64 million) and the 2002 pre-tax charges for integration costs ($17 million).

Financial Review

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.0 billion in 2004, $4.1 billion in 2003 and $3.7 billion in 2002. The decrease in 2004
operating cash flows from 2003 was due primarily to lower net earnings, cash payments associated with the restructuring program and higher pension contributions, partially offset by a lower use of
cash to fund working capital. The increase in 2003
operating cash flows over 2002 was due primarily to a lower use of cash to fund working capital, partially offset by increased pension contributions.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

One element of the growth strategy of the Company is to strengthen its brand portfolios through disciplined programs of selective acquisitions and divestitures.
The Company is constantly reviewing potential acquisition candidates and from time to time sells businesses to accelerate the shift in its portfolio toward businesses—whether global,
regional or local—that offer the Company a sustainable competitive advantage. The impact of any future acquisition or divestiture could have a material impact on the Company's cash flows.

During
2004, 2003 and 2002, net cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The increase in 2004 primarily
reflected higher uses of cash for the purchase of businesses and the reduction of cash received from the sales of businesses, partially offset by lower capital expenditures. The decrease in 2003
primarily reflected lower capital expenditures and lower purchases of businesses, partially offset by the reduction in the cash received from the sales of businesses.

Capital
expenditures, which were funded by operating activities, were $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2004
capital expenditures were primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities, implement the restructuring program and expand production capacity for growing product lines. In 2005, capital expenditures
are currently expected to be at or slightly above 2004 expenditures, including capital expenditures required for the restructuring program. These expenditures are expected to be funded from
operations.

As
previously discussed, during the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company announced the sale of its sugar confectionery, U.K. desserts and yogurt businesses for approximately
$1.5 billion, $135 million


and
$59 million, respectively. These transactions, which are subject to regulatory approval, are expected to be completed during the first half of 2005.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

During 2004, net cash of $3.2 billion was used in financing activities, compared with $2.8 billion during 2003. The increase in cash used in 2004
was due primarily to an increase in the Company's Class A share repurchases and dividend payments. In November 2004, the Company issued $750 million in third-party
long-term debt, the net proceeds of which was used to refinance maturing debt.

During
2003, net cash of $2.8 billion was used in financing activities, compared with $2.6 billion during 2002. The increase in cash used in 2003 was due primarily to an
increase in the Company's Class A share repurchases and an increase in dividend payments, partially offset by a decrease in net debt repayments in 2003 (including amounts due to Altria
Group, Inc. and affiliates). During 2003, the Company issued $1.5 billion of third-party long-term debt, the net proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding related
party indebtedness. Financing activities included net debt repayments of approximately $1.4 billion in 2003.

Debt and Liquidity

Debt.

The Company's total debt, including amounts due to Altria Group, Inc. and affiliates, was $12.5 billion
at December 31, 2004 and $13.5 billion at December 31, 2003. The Company's debt-to-equity ratio was 0.42 at December 31, 2004 and 0.47 at
December 31, 2003. The Company's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.30 at December 31, 2004 and 0.32 at December 31, 2003.

In
November 2004, the Company issued $750 million of 5-year notes bearing interest at 4.125%. The net proceeds of the offering were used to refinance maturing
debt. The Company has a Form S-3 shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under which the Company may sell debt securities and/or
warrants to purchase debt securities in one or more offerings up to a total amount of $4.0 billion. At December 31, 2004, the Company had $3.5 billion of capacity remaining under
its shelf registration.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had short-term amounts payable to Altria Group, Inc. of $227 million and $543 million, respectively.
Interest on these borrowings is based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate.

Credit Ratings.

Following a $10.1 billion judgment on March 21, 2003, against Altria Group, Inc.'s
domestic tobacco subsidiary, Philip Morris USA Inc., the three major credit rating agencies took a series of ratings actions resulting in the lowering of the Company's short-term
and long-term debt ratings, despite the fact the Company is neither a party to, nor has exposure to, this litigation. The Company's credit ratings by Moody's at December 31, 2004,
were "P-2" for short-term debt and "A3" for long-term debt, with stable outlook. The Company's credit ratings by Standard & Poor's at December 31,
2004 were "A-2" for short-term debt and "BBB+" for long-term debt, with stable outlook. The Company's credit ratings by Fitch Rating Services at December 31,
2004 were "F-2" for short-term debt and "BBB+" for long-term debt, with stable outlook. As a result of the rating agencies' actions, borrowing costs have increased.
None of the Company's debt agreements requires accelerated repayment in the event of a decrease in credit ratings. The credit rating downgrades by Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Rating
Services had no impact on any of the Company's other existing third-party contracts.

Credit Lines.

The Company maintains revolving credit facilities that have historically been used to support the issuance of
commercial paper. The 364-day revolving credit facility expires in July 2005, although it contains a provision allowing the Company to extend the maturity of outstanding borrowings


for
up to one additional year. At December 31, 2004, credit lines for the Company and the related activity were as follows (in billions of dollars):

The Company's revolving credit facilities, which are for its sole use, require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of $18.2 billion. At
December 31, 2004, the Company's net worth was $29.9 billion. The Company expects to continue to meet this covenant. The foregoing revolving credit facilities do not include any other
financial tests, any credit rating triggers or any provisions that could require the posting of collateral. The multi-year revolving credit facility enables the Company to reclassify
short-term debt on a long-term basis. At December 31, 2004, in anticipation of the proceeds from the sale of its sugar confectionery business, the Company did not
reclassify any short-term debt as long-term debt. The Company expects to refinance long-term and short-term debt from time to time. The nature and
amount of the Company's long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market
conditions and other factors.

In
addition to the above, certain international subsidiaries of Kraft maintain uncommitted credit lines to meet the short-term working capital needs of the international
businesses. These credit lines, which amounted to approximately $600 million as of December 31, 2004, are for the sole use of the Company's international businesses. Borrowings on these
lines amounted to approximately $150 million and $220 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements other than the guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below.

Guarantees.

As discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had third-party guarantees,
which are primarily derived from acquisition and divestiture activities, of approximately $25 million at December 31, 2004. Substantially all of these guarantees expire through 2013,
with $1 million expiring during 2005. The Company is required to perform under these guarantees in the event that a third party fails to make contractual payments or achieve performance
measures. The Company has a liability of $20 million on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004, relating to these guarantees.

In
addition, at December 31, 2004, the Company was contingently liable for $142 million of guarantees related to its own performance. These include surety bonds related to
dairy commodity purchases and guarantees related to the payment of customs duties and taxes, and letters of credit.

Guarantees
do not have, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on the Company's liquidity.

Amounts
represent the expected cash payments of the Company's long-term debt and do not include bond premiums or discounts, and interest.

Operating
leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. The Company has no significant capital lease obligations.

(3)

Purchase
obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and
distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures,
information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased,
a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty, and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on
the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.

(4)

Other
long-term liabilities primarily consist of certain specific severance and incentive compensation arrangements. The following long-term liabilities
included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension, postretirement health care and postemployment costs, income taxes, minority interest, insurance accruals
and other accruals. The Company is unable to estimate the timing of the payments for these items. Currently, the Company anticipates making U.S. pension contributions of approximately
$250 million in 2005 and non-U.S. pension contributions of approximately $90 million in 2005, based on current tax law (as discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated
financial statements).

The
Company believes that its cash from operations and existing credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital needs, planned capital expenditures,
future contractual obligations and payment of its anticipated quarterly dividends.

Equity and Dividends

In December 2003, Kraft's Board of Directors approved the repurchase from time to time of up to $700 million of Kraft's Class A common stock.
On December 14, 2004, Kraft completed the program,


acquiring
21,718,847 Class A shares at an average price of $32.23 per share. On December 14, 2004, Kraft commenced repurchasing shares under a new two-year
$1.5 billion Class A common stock repurchase program that was authorized by its Board of Directors in December 2004. Through December 31, 2004, repurchases under the
$1.5 billion program were 1,408,413 shares at a cost of $50 million, or $35.49 per share. During 2004, Kraft repurchased 21.5 million shares at a cost of $700 million, and
in 2003 Kraft repurchased 12.5 million shares at a cost of $380 million.

As
discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2004 and 2003, the Company granted 4.1 million and 3.7 million restricted Class A
shares, respectively, to eligible U.S.-based employees, and during 2004 and 2003, also issued to eligible non-U.S. employees rights to receive 1.9 million and 1.6 million
Class A equivalent shares, respectively. The
market value per restricted share or right was $32.23 and $36.56 on the dates of the 2004 and 2003 grants, respectively. Restrictions on most of the stock and rights granted in 2004 lapse in the first
quarter of 2007, while restrictions on grants in 2003 lapse in the first quarter of 2006.

Dividends
paid in 2004 and 2003 were $1,280 million and $1,089 million, respectively, an increase of 17.5%, reflecting a higher dividend rate in 2004, partially offset by a
lower number of shares outstanding as a result of Class A share repurchases. During the third quarter of 2004, Kraft's Board of Directors approved a 13.9% increase in the current quarterly
dividend rate to $0.205 per share on its Class A and Class B common stock. As a result, the present annualized dividend rate is $0.82 per common share. The declaration of dividends is
subject to the discretion of Kraft's Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including the Company's net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other
factors deemed relevant by Kraft's Board of Directors.

Market Risk

The Company operates globally, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations around the world, and utilizes certain financial instruments to manage
its foreign currency and commodity exposures. Derivative financial instruments are used by the Company, principally to reduce exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates and commodity prices by creating offsetting exposures. The Company is not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes.

During
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges was not material. At December 31, 2004, the Company was hedging
forecasted transactions for periods not exceeding fifteen months and expects substantially all amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) to be reclassified to the
consolidated statement of earnings within the next twelve months.

Foreign Exchange Rates.

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options to mitigate its
exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. Substantially all of the Company's derivative financial instruments are effective as hedges.
The primary currencies to which the Company is exposed, based on the size and location of its businesses, include the euro, Swiss franc, British pound and Canadian dollar. At December 31, 2004
and 2003, the Company had foreign exchange option and forward contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. The effective portion of
unrealized gains and losses associated with forward and option contracts is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the underlying hedged transactions are
reported on the Company's consolidated statement of earnings.

Commodities.

The Company is exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities used as raw
materials by its businesses. Accordingly, the Company uses commodity forward contracts as cash flow hedges, primarily for coffee, cocoa, milk and cheese. Commodity futures and options are also used to
hedge the price of certain commodities, including milk, coffee, cocoa,


wheat,
corn, sugar and soybean oil. In general, commodity forward contracts qualify for the normal purchase exception under SFAS No. 133 and are, therefore, not subject to the provisions of
SFAS No. 133. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had net long commodity positions of $443 million and $255 million, respectively. Unrealized gains or losses on net
commodity positions were immaterial at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The effective portion of unrealized gains and losses on commodity futures and option contracts is deferred as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) and is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the Company's consolidated statement of earnings when the related inventory is sold.

Value at Risk.

The Company uses a value at risk ("VAR") computation to estimate the potential one-day loss in the
fair value of its interest rate-sensitive financial instruments and to estimate the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of its foreign currency and commodity
price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. The VAR computation includes the Company's debt; short-term investments; foreign currency forwards, swaps and options; and commodity
futures, forwards and options. Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the foregoing instruments are intended to
hedge, were excluded from the computation.

The
VAR estimates were made assuming normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval. The Company used a "variance/co-variance" model to determine the observed
interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the
preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts during each year. The
values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity, and were valued accordingly in the VAR
computation.

The
estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of the Company's interest rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, under normal market conditions and the
estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from foreign currency and commodity instruments under normal market conditions, as calculated in the VAR model, were as
follows (in millions):

This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest
rates, foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions. The computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by the Company,
nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. The Company cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and does not present these VAR results to be indicative of
future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on its future results of operations or financial position.

Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:

•

pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America;

•

provide
reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
and

•

provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements.

Internal
control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. Management based this assessment on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the
operational effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.

Based
on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2004, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.

PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this report, has
issued an attestation report on management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting.

February 2,


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Kraft Foods Inc.:

We
have completed an integrated audit of Kraft Foods Inc.'s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Kraft Foods Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting dated February 2, 2005,
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and


dispositions
of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

KRAFT FOODS INC. and SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES to CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.    Background and Basis of Presentation:

Background:

Kraft
Foods Inc. ("Kraft") was incorporated in 2000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Kraft, through its subsidiaries (Kraft and its subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as the
"Company"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of branded foods and beverages in the United States, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Middle East and Africa.

Prior
to June 13, 2001, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. On June 13, 2001, the Company completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of
280,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock at a price of $31.00 per share. At December 31, 2004, Altria Group, Inc. held 98.0% of the combined voting power of the Company's
outstanding capital stock and owned 85.4% of the outstanding shares of the Company's capital stock.

On
November 15, 2004, the Company announced the sale of substantially all of its sugar confectionery business for approximately $1.5 billion. The transaction, which is
subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2005. The Company has reflected the results of its sugar confectionery business as discontinued operations on the
consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented. The assets related to the sugar confectionery business were reflected as assets of discontinued operations held for sale on the
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004. Accordingly, historical statements of earnings amounts
included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the discontinued operation.

During
January 2004, the Company announced a new global organization structure, which resulted in new segments. During the fourth quarter of 2004, following the sale of its sugar
confectionery business, the Company realigned its North American segments. The Company's new segments, which are reflected in these financial statements and notes, are U.S. Beverages; U.S. Cheese,
Canada & North America Foodservice; U.S. Convenient Meals; U.S. Grocery; U.S. Snacks & Cereals; Europe, Middle East & Africa; and Latin America & Asia Pacific. The new
segment structure in North America reflects a shift of certain divisions and brands between segments to more closely align these businesses to consumer sectors, to provide more focus on the separate
beverage and grocery businesses, and to benefit from synergies in grain based products. Historical data have been restated to reflect the new segment structure.

Basis of presentation:

The
consolidated financial statements include Kraft, as well as its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which the Company exercises significant influence
(20%—50% ownership interest) are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments in which the Company has an ownership interest of less than 20%, or does not exercise
significant influence, are accounted for with the cost method of accounting. All intercompany transactions and balances between and among Kraft's subsidiaries have been eliminated. Transactions
between any of the Company's businesses and Altria Group, Inc. and its affiliates are included in these financial statements.

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things, pension and benefit plan assumptions, lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and other intangible
assets, and income


taxes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company's operating subsidiaries report year-end results as of the Saturday closest to the end of each year.

Certain
prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation, due primarily to the new segment structure and the classification of the sugar
confectionery business as discontinued operations.

Note 2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

Cash and cash equivalents:

Cash
equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Depreciation, amortization and goodwill valuation:

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment
are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 20 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 40 years.

Definite
life intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company is required to conduct an annual review of goodwill and intangible assets for potential
impairment. Goodwill impairment testing requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of each reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill is considered
impaired. The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined using discounted cash flows. Impairment testing
for non-amortizable intangible assets requires a comparison between fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, the intangible asset is
considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. During 2004, the Company completed its annual review of goodwill and intangible assets. This review resulted in a $29 million
non-cash pre-tax charge related to an intangible asset impairment for a small confectionery business in the United States and certain brands in Mexico. A portion of this
charge, $12 million, was recorded as asset impairment and exit costs on the consolidated statement of earnings. The remainder of the charge, $17 million, is included in discontinued
operations.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, goodwill by reportable segment was as follows (in millions):

Non-amortizable
intangible assets are substantially comprised of brand names purchased through the Nabisco acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of
certain trademark licenses and non-compete agreements. Pre-tax amortization expense for intangible assets was $11 million, $9 million and $7 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Amortization expense for each of the next five years is currently estimated to be $12 million or less.

above, includes the reclassification to goodwill of certain amounts previously classified as indefinite life intangible assets, as well as tax adjustments related to the Nabisco
acquisition.

Environmental costs:

The
Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The Company provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on
an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change.

While
it is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental remediation and compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the
future, in the opinion of management, environmental remediation and compliance costs, before taking into account any recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Foreign currency translation:

The
Company translates the results of operations of its foreign subsidiaries using average exchange rates during each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange
rates at the end of each period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders' equity. Transaction gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of
earnings and were not significant for any of the periods presented.


Guarantees:

Effective
January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." Interpretation No. 45 required the disclosure of certain guarantees existing at December 31, 2002. In addition,
Interpretation No. 45 requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities initiated or modified after December 31, 2002. The
Company has applied the recognition provisions of Interpretation No. 45 to guarantee activity initiated after December 31, 2002. Adoption of Interpretation No. 45 as of
January 1, 2003 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 18.

Contingencies

for a
further discussion of guarantees.

Hedging instruments:

Derivative
financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each
period either in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) or in earnings, depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type
of hedge transaction. Gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) are reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods
in which operating results are affected by the hedged item. Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash
flows.

Impairment of long-lived assets:

The
Company reviews long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. For purposes of recognition and measurement of
an impairment for assets held for use, the Company groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, any
related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.

Income taxes:

The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The accounts of the Company
are included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Altria Group, Inc. Income taxes are generally computed on a separate company basis. To the extent that foreign tax credits, capital
losses and other credits generated by the Company, which cannot currently be utilized on a separate company basis, are utilized in Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated federal income tax return,
the benefit is recognized in the calculation of the Company's provision for income taxes. Based on the Company's current estimate, this benefit is calculated to be approximately $70 million,
$100 million and $240 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company makes payments to, or is reimbursed by, Altria Group, Inc. for
the tax effects resulting from its inclusion in Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated federal income tax return. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in
evaluating tax positions. The Company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that their tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that
are likely to be challenged and that may not be sustained on review by tax authorities. The Company adjusts these additional accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances. The consolidated tax
provision includes the impact of changes to accruals that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.


Inventories:

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. The last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method is used to cost a majority of domestic inventories. The cost of
other inventories is principally determined by the average cost method.

In
2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs." SFAS No. 151 requires that abnormal idle facility expense, spoilage, freight and handling costs be recognized as
current-period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventories be based on the normal capacity of the production facility. The
Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 151 prospectively after January 1, 2006, but the effect of adoption is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Marketing costs:

The
Company promotes its products with advertising, consumer incentives and trade promotions. Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates,
in-store display incentives and volume- based incentives. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of
revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period, based
principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. For interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on
estimated volume and related expense for the full year.

Revenue recognition:

The
Company recognizes revenues, net of sales incentives and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, upon shipment of goods when title and risk of loss pass to
customers. Shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales.

Software costs:

The
Company capitalizes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized
software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software,
which do not exceed five years.

Stock-based compensation:

The
Company accounts for employee stock compensation plans in accordance with the intrinsic value-based method permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," which has not resulted in compensation cost for stock options. The market value at date of grant of restricted stock and rights to receive shares of stock is recorded as compensation
expense over the period of restriction.

At
December 31, 2004, the Company had stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 11.

Stock
Plans.

The Company applies the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and
related Interpretations in accounting for stock options within those plans. No compensation expense for employee stock options is reflected in net earnings, as all stock options granted under those
plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Net earnings, as reported, includes pre-tax compensation expense related to restricted stock
and rights to receive shares of stock of $106 million, $57 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The following table
illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per share ("EPS") if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to


measure
stock-based compensation expense for outstanding stock option awards for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (in millions, except per share data):

In
2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123R"). SFAS No. 123R requires companies to measure compensation cost for
share-based payments at fair value. The Company will adopt this new standard prospectively on July 1, 2005, and does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R to have a material impact on
its 2005 consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 3.    Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs:

Restructuring Program:

In January 2004, the Company announced a three-year restructuring program with the objectives of leveraging the Company's global scale,
realigning and lowering its cost structure, and optimizing capacity utilization. As part of this program, the Company anticipates the closing or sale of up to twenty plants and the elimination of
approximately six thousand positions. From 2004 through 2006, the Company expects to incur up to $1.2 billion in pre-tax charges, reflecting asset disposals, severance and other
implementation costs, including $641 million incurred in 2004. Approximately one-half of the pre-tax charges are expected to require cash payments.

Restructuring Costs:

During 2004, pre-tax charges under the restructuring program of $583 million were recorded as asset impairment and exit costs on the
consolidated statement of earnings. These charges resulted from the 2004 announcement of the closing of thirteen plants, the termination of co-manufacturing agreements and the commencement
of a number of workforce reduction programs. Approximately $216 million of the pre-tax charges incurred in 2004 will require cash payments.

Severance
costs in the above schedule, which relate to the workforce reduction programs, include the cost of related benefits. Specific programs announced during 2004, as part of the
overall restructuring program, will result in the elimination of approximately 3,500 positions. Asset write-downs relate to the impairment of assets caused by the plant closings. Other costs incurred
relate primarily to contract termination costs associated with the plant closings and the termination of co-manufacturing agreements.

Implementation Costs:

During 2004, the Company recorded $58 million of pre-tax implementation costs associated with the restructuring program, of which
$7 million was recorded as a reduction of net revenues, $30 million was recorded in cost of sales, $13 million was recorded in marketing, administration and research costs, and
$8 million related to the sugar confectionery business was recorded in loss from discontinued operations, on the consolidated statement of earnings. These costs include the discontinuance of
certain product lines and incremental costs related to the integration of functions and closure of facilities. Approximately $36 million of these costs will require cash payments.

Asset Impairment Charges:

During 2004, the Company completed its annual review of goodwill and intangible assets. This review resulted in a $29 million non-cash
pre-tax charge related to an intangible asset impairment for a small confectionery business in the United States and certain brands in Mexico. A portion of this charge, $17 million,
relates to the sugar confectionery business and has been recorded in loss from discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings. The remaining charge was recorded as asset impairment
and exit costs on the consolidated statement of earnings.

In
November 2004, the Company completed a valuation of its equity investment in a joint venture in Turkey following the determination that a non-temporary decline in
value had occurred. This valuation resulted in a $47 million non-cash pre-tax charge. This charge was recorded as marketing, administration and research costs on the
consolidated statement of earnings.

On
November 15, 2004, the Company announced the sale of substantially all of its sugar confectionery business for approximately $1.5 billion. As a result of the anticipated
transaction, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2005, the Company recorded non-cash asset impairments totaling $107 million. This charge was included in loss from
discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings.

In
December 2004, the Company announced the sale of its yogurt business for approximately $59 million. As a result of the anticipated transaction, which is expected to
close in the first quarter of 2005, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $8 million. This charge was recorded as asset impairment and exit costs on the consolidated statement of
earnings.

2004, Altria Corporate Services, Inc. provided to the Company certain financial services, including payroll and accounts payable processing, at a cost of approximately
$25 million, which was included in the $310 million charge shown above. Beginning in 2005, the Company will perform these functions for itself at a similar cost.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had short-term amounts payable to Altria Group, Inc. of $227 million and $543 million, respectively.
Interest on these borrowings is based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate.

The
fair values of the Company's short-term amounts due to Altria Group, Inc. and affiliates approximate carrying amounts.

Note 5.    Divestitures:

Discontinued Operations:

On November 15, 2004, the Company announced the sale of substantially all of its sugar confectionery business for approximately $1.5 billion. The
proposed sale includes the

Life Savers

,

Creme Savers

,

Altoids

,

Trolli

and

Sugus

brands. The transaction, which
is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2005. The Company has reflected the results of its sugar confectionery business as discontinued operations on
the consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented. Pursuant to the sugar confectionery sale agreement, the Company has agreed to provide certain transition and supply services to the
buyer. These service arrangements are primarily for terms of one year or less, with the exception of one supply arrangement with a term of not more than three years. The expected cash flow from this
supply arrangement is not significant.

Summary
results of operations for the sugar confectionery business were as follows:

Other:

During 2004, the Company sold a Brazilian snack nuts business and trademarks associated with a candy business in Norway. The aggregate proceeds received from the
sale of these businesses were $18 million, on which pre-tax losses of $3 million were recorded. In December 2004, the Company announced the sale of its U.K. desserts
business for approximately $135 million, which is expected to result in an estimated gain of $0.04 per share. The transaction, which is subject to required approvals, is expected to close in
the first quarter of 2005, following
completion of necessary employee consultation requirements. The Company also announced in December 2004, the sale of its yogurt business for approximately $59 million, which is expected
to result in an after-tax loss of approximately $12 million ($5 million in 2004, with the remainder at closing). The transaction, which is also subject to regulatory
approval, is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005.

During
2003, the Company sold a European rice business and a branded fresh cheese business in Italy. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses were $96 million, on
which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $31 million.

During
2002, the Company sold several small North American food businesses, some of which had been previously classified as businesses held for sale arising from the acquisition of
Nabisco. The net revenues and operating results of the businesses held for sale, which were not significant, were excluded from the Company's consolidated statements of earnings, and no gain or loss
was recognized on these sales. In addition, the Company sold its Latin American yeast and industrial bakery ingredients business for approximately $110 million and recorded a
pre-tax gain of $69 million. The aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses were $219 million, on which the Company recorded pre-tax gains of
$80 million.

The
operating results of the other businesses sold, discussed above, were not material to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the
periods presented.

Note 6.    Acquisitions:

During 2004, the Company acquired a U.S.-based beverage business for a total cost of $137 million.

During
2003, the Company acquired a biscuits business in Egypt and trademarks associated with a small U.S.-based natural foods business. The total cost of these and other smaller
acquisitions was $98 million.

During
2002, the Company acquired a snacks business in Turkey and a biscuits business in Australia. The total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was $122 million.


The
effects of these acquisitions were not material to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.

Note 7.    Inventories:

The cost of approximately 37% and 39% of inventories in 2004 and 2003, respectively, was determined using the LIFO method. The stated LIFO amounts of inventories
were approximately $81 million and $155 million higher than the current cost of inventories at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Note 8.    Short-Term Borrowings and Borrowing Arrangements:

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had short-term borrowings of $1,818 million and $2,453 million, respectively,
consisting principally of commercial paper borrowings with an average year-end interest rate of 2.4% and 1.4%, respectively. Of these amounts, the Company reclassified
$1,900 million at December 31, 2003, of the commercial paper borrowings to long-term debt based upon its intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a
long-term basis.

The
fair values of the Company's short-term borrowings at December 31, 2004 and 2003, based upon current market interest rates, approximate the amounts disclosed
above.

Following
a $10.1 billion judgment on March 21, 2003, against Altria Group, Inc.'s domestic tobacco subsidiary, Philip Morris USA Inc., the three major credit
rating agencies took a series of ratings actions resulting in the lowering of the Company's short-term and long-term debt ratings, despite the fact the Company is neither a
party to, nor has exposure to, this litigation. The Company's credit ratings by Moody's at December 31, 2004, were "P-2" for short-term debt and "A3" for
long-term-debt, with stable outlook. The Company's credit ratings by Standard & Poor's at December 31, 2004 were "A-2" for short-term debt
and "BBB+" for long-term debt, with stable outlook. The Company's credit ratings by Fitch Rating Services at December 31, 2004 were "F-2" for short-term debt
and "BBB+" for long-term debt, with stable outlook. None of the Company's debt agreements requires accelerated repayment in the event of a decrease in credit ratings.

The
Company maintains revolving credit facilities that have historically been used to support the issuance of commercial paper. The 364-day revolving credit facility expires
in July 2005, although it contains a provision allowing the Company to extend the maturity of outstanding borrowings for up to one additional year. At December 31, 2004, credit lines for
the Company and the related activity were as follows (in billions of dollars):

The
Company's revolving credit facilities, which are for its sole use, require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of $18.2 billion. At December 31, 2004, the Company's
net worth was $29.9 billion. The Company expects to continue to meet this covenant. The foregoing revolving credit facilities do not include any other financial tests, any credit rating
triggers or any provisions that could require the posting of collateral.

In
addition to the above, certain international subsidiaries of Kraft maintain uncommitted credit lines to meet the short-term working capital needs of the international
businesses. These credit lines, which amounted to approximately $600 million as of December 31, 2004, are for the sole use of the Company's


international
businesses. Borrowings on these lines amounted to approximately $150 million and $220 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Note 9.    Long-Term Debt:

respectively.

Kraft
repurchases its Class A common stock in open market transactions. On December 14, 2004, Kraft completed a multi-year $700 million Class A
common stock repurchase program, acquiring 21,718,847 Class A shares at an average price of $32.23 per share. During 2004, repurchases under the $700 million program were 20,135,247
shares at a cost of $650 million, or $32.28 per share. On December 14, 2004, the Company commenced repurchasing shares under a new $1.5 billion Class A common stock
repurchase program that was authorized by the Board of Directors on December 2, 2004. Through December 31, 2004, repurchases under the $1.5 billion program were 1,408,413 shares
at a cost of $50 million, or $35.49 per share. On December 3, 2003, Kraft completed a $500 million Class A common stock repurchase program, acquiring 15,308,458
Class A shares at an average price of $32.66 per share.

In
addition, 1.18 billion Class B common shares were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Altria Group, Inc. holds 276.5 million
Class A common shares and all of the Class B common shares at December 31, 2004. There are no preferred shares issued and outstanding. Class A common shares are entitled to
one vote each, while Class B common shares are entitled to ten votes each. Therefore, Altria Group, Inc. holds 98.0% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding capital
stock at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, 66,663,515 shares of common stock were reserved for stock options and other stock awards.


Note 11.    Stock Plans:

Under the 2001 Kraft Performance Incentive Plan (the "2001 Plan"), the Company may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, reload
options and other awards based on the Company's Class A common stock, as well as performance-based annual and long-term incentive awards. A maximum of 75 million shares of
the Company's Class A common stock may be issued under the 2001 Plan. In addition, the Company may grant up to 500,000 shares of Class A common stock to members of the Board of Directors
who are not full-time employees of the Company or Altria Group, Inc., or their subsidiaries, under the Kraft Directors Plan (the "2001 Directors Plan"). Shares available to be
granted under the 2001 Plan and the 2001 Directors Plan at December 31, 2004, were 46,707,241 and 458,633, respectively.

The
Company applies the intrinsic value-based methodology in accounting for the various stock plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized other than for restricted
stock awards. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, which requires companies to measure compensation cost for share-based payments at fair value. The Company will adopt this
new standard prospectively on July 1, 2005.

Prior
to the IPO, certain employees of the Company participated in Altria Group, Inc.'s stock compensation plans. Altria Group, Inc. does not intend to issue additional
Altria Group, Inc. stock compensation to the Company's employees, except for reloads of previously issued options. Altria Group, Inc. accounts for its plans in accordance with the
intrinsic value-based method permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which did not result in compensation cost for stock options.

At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company's employees held options to purchase the following number of shares of Altria Group, Inc. stock: 39,241,651 shares at an average
exercise price of $37.25 per share at December 31, 2003; and 46,615,162 shares at an average exercise price of $35.78 per share at December 31, 2002. Of these amounts, the following were
exercisable at each
date: 39,025,325 at an average exercise price of $37.19 per share at December 31, 2003; and 46,231,629 at an average exercise price of $35.69 per share at December 31, 2002.

Had
compensation cost for stock option awards under the Kraft plans and Altria Group, Inc. plans been determined by using the fair value at the grant date, the Company's net
earnings and basic and diluted EPS would have been $2,658 million, $1.56 and $1.55, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004; $3,464 million, $2.01 and $2.00,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003; and $3,316 million, $1.91 and $1.91, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002. The foregoing impact of compensation

The
Company may grant shares of restricted stock and rights to receive shares of stock to eligible employees, giving them in most instances all of the rights of stockholders, except that
they may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such shares and rights. Such shares and rights are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. During 2004 and 2003, the
Company granted approximately 4.1 million and 3.7 million restricted Class A shares, respectively, to eligible U.S.-based employees, and during 2004 and 2003, also issued to
eligible non-U.S. employees rights to receive approximately 1.9 million and 1.6 million Class A equivalent shares, respectively. The market value per restricted share
or right was $32.23 and $36.56 on the dates of the 2004 and 2003 grants, respectively. At December 31, 2004, restrictions on these shares and rights, net of forfeitures, lapse as follows:
2005—13,719 shares; 2006—4,520,120 shares; 2007—5,532,500 shares; 2009—150,000 shares; and 2012—100,000 shares.

The
fair value of the shares of restricted stock and rights to receive shares of stock at the date of grant is amortized to expense ratably over the restriction period. The Company
recorded compensation expense related to the restricted stock and rights of $106 million and $57 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
unamortized portion, which is reported on the


consolidated
balance sheets as a reduction of earnings reinvested in the business, was $190 million and $129 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
(loss) earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 included a deferred income tax benefit of $43 million. The Company also anticipates
additional tax expense of approximately $270 million in 2005, once the sale of its sugar confectionery business has been consummated.

At
December 31, 2004, applicable United States federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $3.8 billion of accumulated
earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be permanently reinvested.

On
October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act ("the Jobs Act") was signed into law. The Jobs Act includes a deduction for 85% of certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated. The Company may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in 2005 and is conducting analyses of its effects. The U.S. Treasury Department recently provided
additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision, which is under consideration as part of the Company's evaluation. The Company expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the
repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time. The Company does not expect the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act to have a significant impact on its consolidated results of
operations or its consolidated cash flows.

The
Jobs Act also provides tax relief to U.S. domestic manufacturers by providing a tax deduction up to 9% of the lesser of "qualified production activities income" or taxable income. In
December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109-1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,' to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production
Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP 109-1"). FSP 109-1 requires companies to account for this deduction as a "special deduction" rather than a
rate reduction, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, and therefore, the Company will recognize these benefits, which are not expected to be significant, in the year earned.

The
effective income tax rate on pre-tax earnings differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the following reasons for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002:

$35 million of tax accruals that are no longer required due to tax events that occurred during the first quarter of 2004.

Note 14.    Segment Reporting:

The Company manufactures and markets packaged food products, consisting principally of beverages, cheese, snacks, convenient meals and various packaged grocery
products. Kraft manages and reports operating results through two units, Kraft North America Commercial and Kraft International Commercial. Reportable segments for Kraft North America Commercial are
organized and managed principally by product category. Kraft International Commercial's operations are organized and managed by geographic location.

During
January 2004, the Company announced a new global organizational structure, which resulted in new segments. During the fourth quarter of 2004, following the sale of its
sugar confectionery business, as discussed in Note 5.

Divestitures

, the Company realigned its North American segments. Kraft North America
Commercial's new segments are U.S. Beverages; U.S. Cheese, Canada & North America Foodservice; U.S. Convenient Meals; U.S. Grocery; and U.S. Snacks & Cereals. Kraft International
Commercial's segments are Europe, Middle East & Africa; and Latin America & Asia Pacific. The new segment structure in North America reflects a shift of certain divisions and brands
between segments to more closely align these businesses to consumer sectors, to provide more focus on the separate beverage and grocery businesses, and to benefit from synergies in grain based
products. Historical data have been restated to reflect the new segment structure.

The
Company's management uses operating companies income, which is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate segment
performance and allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business performance and trends of the various business segments.
Interest and other debt expense, net, and provision for income taxes are centrally managed and, accordingly, such items are not presented by segment since they are not included in the measure of
segment profitability reviewed by management. The Company's assets, which are principally in the United States and Europe, are managed geographically. The accounting policies of the segments are the
same as those described in Note 2.

Note 15.    Benefit Plans:

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised SFAS No. 132, "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits." In accordance
with the pronouncement, the Company adopted the revised disclosure requirements of this pronouncement for its U.S. plans in 2003 and for its non-U.S. plans in 2004.

The
Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. Pension coverage for employees of the Company's non-U.S.
subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans, many of which are governed by local statutory requirements. In addition, the Company's U.S. and Canadian
subsidiaries provide health care and other benefits to substantially all retired employees. Health care benefits for retirees outside the United States and Canada are generally covered through local
government plans.

The
plan assets and benefit obligations of the Company's U.S. and Canadian pension plans are measured at December 31 of each year and all other non-U.S. pension plans
are measured at September 30 of each year. The benefit obligations of the Company's postretirement plans are measured at December 31 of each year.

The
combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans resulted in a net prepaid pension asset of $2,404 million and $1,985 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. These amounts were recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2004 and 2003, as prepaid pension assets of $3,569 million and
$3,243 million, respectively, for those plans in which plan assets exceeded their accumulated benefit obligations, and as other liabilities of $1,165 million and $1,258 million,
respectively, for plans in which the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded their plan assets.

For
U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the change in the additional minimum liability in 2004 and 2003 was as follows:

The
accumulated benefit obligation for the U.S. pension plans was $5,327 million and $4,898 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The accumulated
benefit obligation for the non-U.S. pension plans was $3,251 million and $2,708 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, certain of the Company's U.S. pension plans were underfunded, with projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and the fair value
of plan assets of $260 million, $188 million and $11 million, respectively, in 2004, and $261 million, $208 million and
$14 million, respectively, in 2003. The majority of these relate to plans for salaried employees that cannot be funded under IRS regulations. For certain non-U.S. plans, which have
accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $2,012 million,
$1,877 million and $950 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004, and $1,648 million, $1,532 million and $588 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2003.

Retiring
employees elected lump-sum payments, resulting in settlement losses of $41 million, $51 million and $21 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. In addition, during 2002, certain salaried employees in the United States left the Company under a voluntary early retirement program instituted in 2001. This resulted in special
termination benefits and curtailment and settlement losses of $109 million in 2002. In 2004, a non-U.S. plant closure and early retirement benefits resulted in curtailment and
settlement losses of $7 million.

The
Company's expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by the plan assets' historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of
future long-term returns by asset class. The Company has reduced this assumption to 8% in determining its U.S. plans pension expense for 2005. In 2005, the discount rate used to determine
the Company's net pension cost for its U.S. plans will be 5.75% and the rate of compensation increase for its U.S. plans will be 4.00%.

Kraft
and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor employee savings plans, to which the Company contributes. These plans cover certain salaried, non-union and union employees. The
Company's contributions and costs are determined by the matching of employee contributions, as defined by the plans. Amounts charged to expense for defined contribution plans totaled
$92 million, $84 million and $64 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Plan Assets

The
Company's investment strategy is based on an expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term. Accordingly, the composition of the Company's U.S.
plan assets is broadly characterized as a 70%/30% allocation between equity and debt securities. The strategy utilizes indexed U.S. equity securities and actively managed investment grade debt
securities (which constitute 80% or more of debt securities) with lesser allocations to high yield and international debt securities.

For
the plans outside the U.S., the investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset/liability profiles of the plans in each individual country. These specific
circumstances result in
a level of equity exposure that is typically less than the U.S. plans. In aggregate, the actual asset allocations of the non-U.S. plans are virtually identical to their respective asset
policy targets.

The
Company attempts to mitigate investment risk by rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes as the Company's contributions and monthly benefit payments are made.

The
Company presently plans to make contributions, to the extent that they are tax deductible, in order to maintain plan assets in excess of the accumulated benefit obligation of its
funded U.S. and non-U.S. plans. Currently, the Company anticipates making contributions of approximately $250 million in 2005 to its U.S. plans and approximately $90 million
in 2005 to its non-U.S. plans, based on current tax law. However, these estimates are subject to change as a result of changes in tax law, as well as asset


performance
significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return on pension assets, or significant changes in interest rates.

estimated future benefit payments from the Company's pension plans at December 31, 2004, were as follows:

During
2002, certain salaried employees in the United States left the Company under a voluntary early retirement program instituted in 2001. This resulted in curtailment losses of
$16 million in 2002, which are included in other expense above.

In
December 2003, the United States enacted into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act"). The Act establishes a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare, known as "Medicare Part D," and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare Part D.

In
May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003" ("FSP 106-2"). FSP 106-2 requires companies to account for the effect of the subsidy on benefits attributable to past service as an actuarial
experience gain and as a reduction of the service cost component of net postretirement health care costs for amounts attributable to current service, if the benefit provided is at least actuarially
equivalent to Medicare Part D.

The
Company adopted FSP 106-2 in the third quarter of 2004. The impact of adoption for 2004 was a reduction of pre-tax net postretirement health care costs and an
increase in net earnings of $24 million, which is included above as a reduction of $3 million in service cost, $10 million in interest cost and $11 million in amortization
of unrecognized net loss from experience differences. In addition, as of July 1, 2004, the Company reduced its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the subsidy related to benefits
attributed to past service by $315 million and decreased its unrecognized actuarial losses by the same amount.

Note 17.    Financial Instruments:

Derivative financial instruments

The Company operates globally, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations around the world, and utilizes certain financial instruments to manage
its foreign currency and commodity exposures. Derivative financial instruments are used by the Company, principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates and commodity prices by creating offsetting exposures. The Company is not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes. Financial
instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged
period. The Company formally documents the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives, strategies for
undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of the
forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur. If it were deemed probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur,
the gain or loss would be recognized in earnings currently.

The
Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options to mitigate its exposure to changes in exchange rates from third-party and intercompany actual and
forecasted transactions. Substantially all of the Company's derivative financial instruments are effective as hedges. The primary currencies to which the Company is exposed, based on the size and
location of its


businesses,
include the euro, Swiss franc, British pound and Canadian dollar. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had foreign exchange option and forward contracts with aggregate
notional amounts of $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. The effective portion of unrealized gains and losses associated with forward and option contracts is deferred as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) until the underlying hedged transactions are reported on the Company's consolidated statement of earnings.

The
Company is exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities used as raw materials by its businesses. Accordingly, the Company uses commodity forward
contracts as cash flow hedges, primarily for coffee, cocoa, milk and cheese. Commodity futures and options are also used to hedge the price of certain commodities, including milk, coffee, cocoa,
wheat, corn, sugar and soybean oil. In general, commodity forward contracts qualify for the normal purchase exception under SFAS No. 133 and are, therefore, not subject to the provisions of
SFAS No. 133. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had net long commodity positions of $443 million and $255 million, respectively. Unrealized gains or losses on net
commodity positions were immaterial at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The effective portion of unrealized gains and losses on commodity futures and option contracts is deferred as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) and is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the Company's consolidated statement of earnings when the related inventory is sold.

Ineffectiveness
related to cash flow hedges was not material for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. At December 31, 2004, the Company was hedging forecasted
transactions for periods not exceeding fifteen months and expects substantially all amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) to be reclassified to the consolidated
statement of earnings within the next twelve months.

Derivative
gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses) are a result of qualifying hedging activity. Transfers of gains or losses from accumulated other
comprehensive earnings (losses) to earnings are offset by corresponding gains or losses on the underlying hedged item. Hedging activity affected accumulated other comprehensive earnings (losses), net
of income taxes, during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, as follows (in millions):

Credit exposure and credit risk

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance, and such exposure
was not material at December 31, 2004.

Fair value

The aggregate fair value, based on market quotes, of the Company's third-party debt at December 31, 2004, was $12,835 million as compared with its
carrying value of $12,291 million. The aggregate fair value of the Company's third-party debt at December 31, 2003, was $13,426 million as compared with its carrying value of
$12,919 million.

See
Notes 4, 8 and 9 for additional disclosures of fair value for short-term borrowings and long-term debt.


Note 18.    Contingencies:

Kraft and its subsidiaries are parties to a variety of legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business, including a few cases in which substantial
amounts of damages are sought. While the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Third-Party Guarantees

At December 31, 2004, the Company's third-party guarantees, which are primarily derived from acquisition and divestiture activities, approximated
$25 million. Substantially all of these guarantees
expire through 2013, with $1 million expiring during 2005. The Company is required to perform under these guarantees in the event that a third party fails to make contractual payments or
achieve performance measures. The Company has a liability of $20 million on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004, relating to these guarantees.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures.

The
Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company's reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our management evaluated, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, any change in the Company's internal control
over financial reporting and determined that there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2004 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
