PART I

Item 1. Business.

Introduction

The Home Depot, Inc. ("Home Depot" or the "Company") is the world's largest home improvement retailer and the second largest retailer in the United States, based on net
sales for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2005 ("Fiscal 2004"). At the end of Fiscal 2004, we were operating 1,890 stores. Most of our stores are either Home Depot® stores or EXPO
Design Center® stores. A description of each of these types of stores is as follows:

Home
Depot stores sell a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement and lawn and garden products and provide a number of services. Home Depot stores average approximately 106,000 square
feet of enclosed space, with approximately 22,000 additional square feet in the outside garden area. At the end of Fiscal 2004, we had 1,818 Home Depot stores located throughout the United States
(including the territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands), Canada and Mexico. EXPO Design Center stores sell products and services primarily for home decorating and remodeling projects. Unlike
Home Depot stores, EXPO Design Center stores do not sell building materials and lumber. EXPO Design Center stores offer interior design products, such as kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, soft and hard
flooring, window treatments and lighting fixtures. EXPO Design Center stores average approximately 100,000 square feet of enclosed space. At the end of Fiscal 2004, we were operating 54 EXPO Design
Center stores in the United States.

In
addition to Home Depot and EXPO Design Center stores, we also have two store formats focused on professional customers called The Home Depot Supply store and Home Depot Landscape Supply. At the end
of Fiscal 2004, we were operating five The Home Depot Supply stores and 11 Home Depot Landscape Supply stores. We also have two stores located in Texas and Florida called The Home Depot Floor Store
that sell primarily flooring products. Our Landscape Supply locations are designed to extend the reach of Home Depot's garden departments, focusing on professional landscapers and
do-it-yourself garden enthusiasts. Each location has a heated/cooled space of about 12,000 square feet, a covered greenhouse


and
1 to 3 acres of fenced-in "Pro-Yard." We currently plan to open a total of 175 stores during Fiscal 2005.

The
Home Depot Supply distributes products and sells installation services primarily to businesses and governments. During Fiscal 2004, The Home Depot Supply operated primarily through five
subsidiaries, Apex Supply Company, Inc. ("Apex Supply Company"), Your Other Warehouse, LLC ("Your Other Warehouse"), The Home Depot Supply, Inc. ("The Home Depot Supply"), White Cap
Industries, Inc. ("White Cap") and HD Builder Solutions Group, Inc. ("HD Builder Solutions Group"). Apex Supply Company, The Home Depot Supply, and HD Builder Solutions Group conduct
business under The Home Depot Supply brand, and HD Builders Solutions Group also conducts business under the Creative Touch Interiors brand. Apex Supply Company is a wholesale supplier of plumbing,
HVAC, appliances and other related professional products with 26 locations in Florida, Georgia, South
Carolina and Tennessee. Your Other Warehouse is a plumbing, lighting and hardware distributor that focuses on special order fulfillment through five distribution centers in Georgia, Louisiana,
Maryland and Nevada and one call center located in Louisiana. The Home Depot Supply supplies maintenance, repair and operating products serving primarily the multi-family housing, hospitality and
lodging facilities management market. The Home Depot Supply fills orders through 20 distribution centers located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Missouri, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. White Cap distributes specialty hardware, tools and materials to construction contractors. HD Builder Solutions Group provides products
and arranges installation services for production homebuilders through 27 locations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New
Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.

The
Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, N.W., Atlanta, Georgia
30339. Our telephone number is 770-433-8211.

We
maintain an Internet web site at www.homedepot.com. We make available on our web site, free of charge, our Annual Reports to stockholders, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5 as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such documents with, or
furnishing such documents to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We
have included our web site addresses throughout this filing only as textual references. The information contained on our web sites is not incorporated by reference into this
Form 10-K.

Retail Businesses

Home Depot Stores

Operating Strategy.

The operating strategy of Home Depot is to offer a broad assortment of high-quality
merchandise and services at competitive prices using knowledgeable, service-oriented personnel and strong marketing and credit promotions. We believe that our associates'
knowledge of products and home improvement techniques and applications is very important to our marketing approach and our ability to maintain and enhance customer satisfaction.

Customers.

Home Depot stores serve three primary customer groups:

•

Do-It-Yourself ("D-I-Y") Customers:

These customers are
typically homeowners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. To complement the expertise of our associates, Home Depot stores offer "how-to" clinics taught
by associates and merchandise vendors.

•

Do-It-For-Me ("D-I-F-M")
Customers:

These customers are typically homeowners who purchase materials themselves and hire third parties to complete the project and/or installation. We
arrange for the installation of a variety of Home Depot products through qualified independent contractors.


•

Professional Customers:

These customers are professional remodelers, general contractors, repairmen and
tradesmen. In many stores we offer a variety of programs to these customers, including additional delivery and will-call services, dedicated staff, extensive merchandise selections and
expanded credit programs, all of which we believe increase sales to this group.

Products.

A typical Home Depot store stocks 40,000 to 50,000 products during the year, including both national
brand name and proprietary items. The following table shows the percentage of revenues of each major product group (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years:

We
buy our store merchandise from suppliers located throughout the world. We are not dependent on any single supplier. Most of our merchandise is purchased directly from manufacturers, which
eliminates "middleman" costs. We believe that competitive sources of supply are readily available for substantially all of the products we sell in Home Depot stores.

To
complement and enhance our product selection, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with certain suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized
brand names. During Fiscal 2004, we offered a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments including, but not limited to, John Deere® lawn and garden
tractors; Thomasville® kitchen and bathroom cabinets; Silestone® countertops; RIDGID® power tools; Behr Premium Plus® paint; Mill's Pride®
cabinets; Husky® hand tools; GE SmartWater™ water
heaters; Philips® light bulbs; Toro® lawn mowers; Vigoro® lawn care products; GAF® roofing products; Honda® lawn mowers and Lithonia
Lighting™ fluorescent lighting products. We may consider additional strategic alliances and relationships with other suppliers and will continue to assess opportunities to expand the range
of products available under brand names that are exclusive to The Home Depot.

We
maintain a global sourcing merchandise program to source high-quality products directly from manufacturers. This gives our customers a broader selection of innovative products and
better value, while enhancing our gross margin. Our product development merchants travel internationally to identify opportunities to purchase items directly for our stores. Additionally, we have two
sourcing offices located in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China, and have a product development merchant located in Bonn, Germany. We also have product development merchants, as well as a sourcing office, in
Monterrey, Mexico. These initiatives enable us to improve product features and quality, to import products not currently available to our customers and to offer products at a lower price than would
otherwise be available if purchased from third-party importers. We currently source products from more than 600 factories in approximately 35 countries.

Services.

Home Depot stores offer a variety of installation services. These services target
D-I-F-M customers who select and purchase materials for a project and then arrange for professional installation through the Company. Our installed sales programs
use only qualified independent contractors throughout the U.S. and Canada. These programs include the installation of products that are sold in our stores, such as carpeting, flooring, cabinets, water
heaters and countertops, as well as other products such as generators and furnace and central air systems.


Store-Related Programs.

We continually assess our business to find opportunities to increase customer loyalty,
thereby increasing sales. Accordingly, we implemented or expanded a number of in-store initiatives in Home Depot stores and programs aimed at supporting store operations during Fiscal
2004, including:

•

Professional
Business Customer Initiative

. We are committed to being the supplier of choice to a variety of professional customers, including
remodelers, carpenters, plumbers, painters, electricians, building maintenance professionals and designers. During Fiscal 2004, we continued to expand our "Pro" initiative, which adds service-related
programs to our stores that are designed to increase sales to professional customers. Stores participating in the program have added associates at a sales desk dedicated to providing more personalized
service to professional customers, including managing accounts and taking and filling orders for pick-up or delivery. Additionally, during the hours when professionals typically shop,
these stores have assigned sales associates in certain departments to better assist these customers. We have also increased the available quantities of products typically purchased by professionals in
bulk, and we offer certain items in each department
packaged in bulk to provide additional savings. While aimed at the professional customer, this program also enables us to provide D-I-Y customers with improved customer
service, including delivery and will-call services, expanded credit programs and additional merchandise. Through this initiative, we have identified best practices in serving our
professional customers that are being implemented in many of our stores without material additional costs. By the end of Fiscal 2004, we had expanded the Pro initiative into 1,563 stores, 207 of which
were added during the year. We anticipate that during Fiscal 2005, we will expand this initiative to approximately 165 additional stores, including new stores.

•

Appliance
Sales

. During Fiscal 2004, we continued the roll-out of our appliance sales program on our web site and throughout our
stores in the U.S. Through this program we sell appliances manufactured by General Electric®, Maytag® and other leading manufacturers. We display and stock the more popular
appliances in our stores and offer the ability to special order approximately 2,300 additional products through computer kiosks located in stores. Through the computer kiosks we can check inventory
and arrange for delivery to the customer directly from the manufacturer as soon as 48 hours after the order is placed. Appliance showrooms were in 1,787 of our stores at the end of Fiscal 2004,
and we anticipate adding the appliance sales program to an additional 165 stores by the end of Fiscal 2005.

•

Designplace
Initiative

. We continued to implement our Designplace® initiative during Fiscal 2004, rolling the initiative out to an
additional 162 stores and bringing the total to 1,787 stores at the end of Fiscal 2004 from 1,625 stores at the end of Fiscal 2003. This initiative offers an enhanced shopping experience to our design
and décor customers by providing personalized service from specially-trained associates and enhanced merchandise selection in an attractive setting. We expect to add the Designplace
initiative to 165 additional stores during Fiscal 2005.

•

Tool
Rental Centers

. As part of our efforts to satisfy a broad range of the needs of our professional and D-I-Y
customers, we offer a tool rental center in certain stores. We rent approximately 350 commercial-quality tools and equipment in 12 categories, including saws, floor sanders, generators, gas powered
lawn equipment and plumbing tools. Customers can rent the tools on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis. Our associates who work in the tool rental center receive special training in the use and
maintenance of tools. At the end of Fiscal 2004, we had tool rental centers in 1,061 stores compared to 825 stores at the end of Fiscal 2003. By the end of Fiscal 2005, we anticipate having tool
rental centers in approximately 1,186 stores. We believe that offering this service increases the sales of related merchandise without reducing the sales of equipment similar to that available for
rental.

•

Customer
Contact Center

. Since Fiscal 2001, we have had a customer contact center to assist with expediting special orders and managing
installation projects. The customer contact center also


supports
the sale and installation of roofing, siding, windows, water heaters, gutters, fencing and HVAC equipment nationwide. Calls come into the center where customer service representatives assist
customers with product selection and scheduling installations. The orders are then fulfilled through our stores or by third-party service providers. During 2005, we anticipate opening an additional
customer contact center to support approximately 500-750 additional stores. We believe that customer contact centers help us provide better customer service, both in our stores and on the
phone, while reducing costs.

•

Customer
Education Programs

. We offer several programs to enhance the skills of our D-I-Y customers. Our associates and
vendors teach "how-to" clinics that focus on D-I-Y projects, such as installing garbage disposals, laying patio pavers or building a deck. In addition to the
clinics, we offer Home Depot University®, which presents four-week modules allowing our customers to learn about several facets of a home improvement topic. For example, a room
enhancement module may provide instruction on paint, wallpaper and window treatments. Through The Home Depot's Kids Workshop

SM

program, children are instructed in tool safety and
complete a small building project, such as a birdhouse or tool box. We believe that these types of educational programs increase our sales by encouraging our customers to undertake more projects,
differentiating us from our competition and reinforcing our position as experts in home improvement.

Store Growth

United States

. At the end of Fiscal 2004, we were operating 1,657 Home Depot stores in the United States, including the territories of Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands. During Fiscal 2004, we opened 142 new Home Depot stores in the U.S. Although these new store openings occurred primarily in existing markets, we continued our geographic
expansion by opening stores in a number of new markets.

To
increase customer service levels, gain incremental sales and enhance long-term market penetration, we often open new stores near the edge of market areas served by existing stores.
While these openings may initially have a negative impact on comparable store sales growth, we believe this "cannibalization" strategy increases customer satisfaction and our overall market share by
reducing delays in shopping, increasing utilization by existing customers and attracting new customers to more convenient locations. At the end of Fiscal 2004, we believe that approximately 17% of our
stores were cannibalized by certain new stores.

Canada

.
At the end of Fiscal 2004, we were operating 117 Home Depot stores in nine Canadian provinces. Of these stores, 15 were opened during Fiscal 2004. During Fiscal
2005, we plan to open 19 additional stores in Canada.

Mexico

.
At the end of Fiscal 2004, we were operating 44 stores in Mexico. Of these stores, 20 were acquired as part of the June 2004 acquisition of Home Mart
Mexico, S.A. de C.V., the second largest home improvement retailer in Mexico. During Fiscal 2005, we plan to open 10 additional stores in Mexico.

China

.
At the end of 2004, the Company entered into an arrangement to lease commercial space in Shanghai to support a retail initiative in China. The Company is currently
pursuing its strategy for entry into the China home improvement marketplace.

EXPO Design Center Stores

Operating Strategy.

The operating strategy behind our EXPO Design Center stores is to be a complete home decorating
and remodeling resource. Each store offers 12 specialty businesses under one roof and features design showrooms with full-size displays to help customers visualize the end result of
interior design projects. To assist our customers, we also offer complete project management and installation services. Accordingly, we employ associates who have expertise in designing, planning and
completing decorating and remodeling projects.


Customers.

Typically, customers at EXPO Design Center stores are middle- to upper- income
D-I-F-M customers, who purchase merchandise for installation by others. Accordingly, we offer installation services through qualified independent contractors for
most of the products we sell at these stores. Additionally, our professional customers are generally custom builders, remodelers, designers and architects.

Products and Services.

EXPO Design Center stores offer interior design products and installation services for
kitchens, baths, appliances and flooring, as well as products for lighting, decorating and storage and organization projects. EXPO Design Center stores offer a broad range of merchandise in an effort
to
meet the needs of shoppers whose interior design preferences may be beyond the items available in a Home Depot store. While there is minimal overlap between the products offered in Home Depot stores
and EXPO Design Center stores, those products available at EXPO Design Center stores represent a more distinctive assortment of merchandise. In addition to nationally advertised brand name products,
we also offer items that must be special ordered or that are typically offered only through showrooms.

Store Growth.

During Fiscal 2004, we did not open additional EXPO Design Center stores. We currently do not
anticipate opening additional EXPO Design Center stores in Fiscal 2005.

Other Businesses

The Home Depot Supply

Apex Supply Company

Apex Supply Company, now doing business under The Home Depot Supply brand, is a wholesale distributor of plumbing, HVAC, appliances and other related products primarily to
trade and mechanical contractors. Apex Supply Company employs approximately 580 associates through 26 locations in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee.

The Home Depot Supply Stores

The Home Depot Supply stores offer personal service to contractors and other professional customers by providing experienced account managers, expanded lumber and building
material assortments, greater quantities of merchandise and expanded delivery services. At the end of Fiscal 2004, we were operating five of these stores in Arizona, California, Colorado and Texas.

The Home Depot Supply

The Home Depot Supply is a leading distributor of maintenance, repair and operating supplies to the multi-family housing, hospitality and lodging industries. Through its
catalogs, direct mail and field sales representatives, The Home Depot Supply offers approximately 15,000 items. The Home Depot Supply,

variety of other third-party resellers. Your Other Warehouse carries over 40,000 products from over 130 vendors, including Kohler®, American Standard® and other major

of commercial, industrial, residential and infrastructure construction projects. White Cap supplies building materials and structural hardware, as well as power and hand tools.

Internet

Our primary web site is located at www.homedepot.com. This site offers an assortment of products available for sale, information about our products and projects, calculators to
estimate the amount and kinds of materials needed to complete a project, as well as information about our Company (including store locations and hours of operation) and links to our other
on-line businesses. As with our stores, the focus of our web site is on providing information and customer service. We believe our Internet site provides us with an opportunity to build
relationships with our customers, educate our customers, improve service, provide convenient shopping from home and increase store sales. Customers may also order select products from www.expo.com,
the web site of our EXPO Design Center stores, and obtain information about these stores and the products and services they offer.

Through
www.homedepot.com, we offer an assortment of approximately 15,000 items for sale. These items are selected based on their potential for on-line sales and their ability to be
delivered via overnight delivery service. Managing product selection and pricing nationally allows us to promote the same product and price to all visitors to our web sites and allows us to leverage
certain on-line marketing channels that reach across many or all Home Depot store pricing markets.

During
Fiscal 2004, we continued to enhance the content of www.homedepot.com to describe each of the installation services offered by the Company and added the capability to allow potential customers
to conveniently sign up on-line for in-home consultations. We anticipate continuing to improve the quality and quantity of services-related content on-line.

In
Fiscal 2003, we launched www.homedepot.ca to service our Canadian customers. The site provides information on The Home Depot, and a store locator, as well as a link to www.homedepot.com. The web
site is bilingual to service our customers in Canada's two official languages, English and French.

Store Support Services

Information Technologies.

During Fiscal 2004, we continued our investment in technology infrastructure with the
purchase of a major technology center. Located in Austin, Texas, this new center will allow us to


continue
to grow and expand our operations. The center will also be used to house engineers and software developers, leveraging high-tech resources from another geographical location. We
also upgraded our in-store wireless networks to the latest technology allowing for future improvements in mobile computing applications, such as receiving, ordering, and improved associate
communications.

We
continued to improve our technology in other areas of the Company's stores. We implemented self-checkout systems in over 1,000 stores and completed the roll-out of our new
point-of-sale software platform, including new cordless scan guns. These system upgrades further enhance the customer checkout experience.

While
our technology investments have primarily focused on our stores, we have made technology improvements in support of our administrative functions. During Fiscal 2004, we completed the
implementation of SAP's core financial systems. The implementation of SAP consolidated and streamlined our store-based financial systems and provided an increase in functionality while remaining
scalable to support our continued growth. We also implemented a new Human Resource Management System to assist in associate tracking, performance management and career planning. In addition, we
delivered significant technology to support the storage and management of information in the areas of sales, inventory and labor via our new Enterprise Data Warehouse.

Associate Development.

At the end of Fiscal 2004, we employed approximately 325,000 associates, of whom
approximately 23,700 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis. Approximately 68% of our associates are employed on a full-time basis. We believe that
our employee relations are good. To attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve.

We
develop our training programs in a continuing effort to service the needs of our customers and associates. These programs, including mandatory product knowledge training classes, are designed to
increase associates' knowledge of merchandising departments and products, and to educate, develop and test the skills of our associates. Because we primarily promote or relocate current associates to
serve as managers and assistant managers for new stores, training and assessment of our associates is essential to our growth. Our district managers and store managers typically meet with our human
resources managers to discuss the development of assistant managers and department heads.

We
have implemented programs in our stores and divisional offices to ensure that we hire and promote the most qualified associates in a non-discriminatory way. One of the most significant
programs we have is our annual Human Resources Review process, which assesses leaders and teams, reviews succession planning and executive pipeline, high potential associates, staffing, retention,
diversity, training and compliance. The program is closely linked to our Performance Management Process, which evaluates the performance, leadership and potential of all associates. We also maintain a
list of qualified associates who are interested in new assignments and of qualified outside applicants that can be reviewed when positions become available.

Marketing.

We are one of the nation's largest retail advertisers, and we utilize a broad range of mass media and
targeted media. We also incorporate major sponsorships into our marketing plan, such as NASCAR®, the U.S. Olympic® team, The Home Depot Center, ESPN Game Day®,
CBS® College Football and a number of home and garden shows. We extend our reach and educate our customers through proprietary publications, such as the

1-2-3

® home improvement book series.

We
execute our marketing campaigns on both a national and local basis. Because our stores are located throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico, we can achieve greater efficiencies than smaller
retailers by using national advertising. At the same time, we tailor our advertising locally to respond to market differences, both in terms of products and the competitive environment.


Credit Services.

Home Depot offers credit purchase programs through third-party credit providers to both
professional customers and D-I-Y and D-I-F-M customers. In Fiscal 2004, approximately 3.1 million new Home Depot credit accounts were
opened, bringing the total number of Home Depot account holders to approximately 14.0 million. Proprietary credit card sales accounted for approximately 24% of store sales at Fiscal
2004 year end. We also offer an unsecured Home Improvement Loan that gives our customers the opportunity to finance the purchase of products and services in our stores. We believe that this
loan program not only supports large sales, such as kitchen and bath remodels, but also generates incremental sales from our customers.

Intellectual Property.

Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Homer TLC, Inc., we have registered or applied
for registration for a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks and copyrights for use in our businesses, including The Home Depot®; EXPO Design Center® stores;
Hampton Bay® fans, lighting and accessories; Glacier Bay® toilets,
sinks and faucets; Pegasus® faucets and bath accessories; Commercial Electric® lighting fixtures; Workforce® tools, tool boxes and shelving; and
PremiumCut® lumber. We regard our intellectual property as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our brand and stores. We are not aware of any facts
that could be expected to negatively impact our intellectual property.

Quality Assurance Program.

For our globally-sourced products that we directly import, we have a quality assurance
program. Through this program, we have established criteria for supplier and product performance, which measure factors such as product quality and timeliness of shipments. The performance record is
made available to the factories to allow them to strive for improvement. The quality assurance program addresses three main components: the factory, products and packaging.

•

the
factory development group ensures all direct import factories are assessed and qualified to manufacture quality products that meet the expectations we have developed, as
well as to assess their compliance with Home Depot policies;

•

the
product engineering group authorizes laboratories to test products prior to purchase and ensures that qualified inspectors conduct inspections at the factory to ensure
consistent compliance with our requirements, applicable national and international standards, and features determined by our merchants; and

•

the
package engineering group authorizes laboratories to test packaging prior to purchase and ensures that qualified inspectors inspect packaging at the factory to ensure
consistent compliance with all relevant requirements.

Logistics.

We use several mechanisms to lower distribution costs and increase our efficiencies. Import distribution
centers process our globally-sourced merchandise. At the end of Fiscal 2004, we had 13 import distribution centers located in the United States and Canada. At the end of Fiscal 2004, we also had 30
lumber distribution centers in the United States and Canada to support the lumber demands of our stores and 10 transit facilities. At our transit facilities, we receive merchandise from manufacturers
and immediately provide transfer onto trucks for delivery to our stores. The transit facility network will provide service to approximately 80% of our stores in the continental United States by the
end of 2005. We also operate other specialty distribution centers for specific merchandise needs. The distribution centers and transit facilities allow us to provide high service levels to our stores
at relatively low costs. At the end of Fiscal 2004, approximately 40% of the merchandise shipped to our stores was processed through our network of distribution centers and transit facilities. As our
networks evolve, we expect to increase the percentage of merchandise processed by our facilities. The remaining merchandise will be shipped directly from our suppliers to our stores.

In
addition to replenishing merchandise supplies at our stores, we also provide delivery services directly to our customers. We continually assess opportunities to improve our distribution network to
better satisfy the needs of our stores and our customers and to lower costs.


Environmental, Health & Safety (EH&S).

We are committed to maintaining a safe environment for our customers
and associates, and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business. Our EH&S Department consists of a team of directors and managers in the field focused primarily on education
and training, as well as an Atlanta-based team of dedicated EH&S professionals who evaluate, implement and enforce policies and processes Company-wide. Our EH&S Department is responsible
for managing our Global EH&S program, which is implemented in partnership with store-level associates, store and Division management, and the Human Resources and Merchandising Departments. The primary
elements of our EH&S program are (1) establishment of EH&S standards and processes for all aspects of store operations and merchandising, (2) effective training of appropriate associates
on all applicable standards and (3) verifying compliance with established EH&S standards.

Competition.

Our business is highly competitive, based in part on price, store location, customer service and depth
of merchandise. In each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some
products, we also compete with discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other
retailers. In addition to these entities, our EXPO Design Center stores compete with specialty design stores or showrooms, some of which are only open to interior design professionals. Due to the
variety of competition we face, we are unable to precisely measure the impact on our sales by our competitors. We estimate that our share of the U.S. home improvement industry is approximately 12% and
we believe that we are an effective and significant competitor in our markets.

Additionally,
at the end of Fiscal 2004, we had 26 Apex Supply Company locations, of which one is located in Florida, 18 are located in Georgia, two are located in South Carolina and five are located
in Tennessee; five The Home Depot Supply stores located in California, Arizona, Texas and Colorado; 11 Home Depot Landscape Supply stores located in Georgia and Texas; two The Home Depot Floor Stores
located in Florida and Texas; and five Your Other Warehouse distribution centers located in Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland and Nevada.

The
Home Depot Supply has 20 distribution centers located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and

Of
our 1,890 Home Depot stores, EXPO Design Center stores, Home Depot Landscape Supply stores, The Home Depot Supply stores and The Home Depot Floor Stores, at Fiscal 2004 year end
approximately 86% were owned (including those owned subject to a ground lease) consisting of approximately 173 million square feet, and approximately 14% of such stores were leased consisting
of approximately 27.6 million square feet. In recent years, we have increased the relative percentage of new stores that are owned. We generally prefer to own stores because of greater
operating control and flexibility, generally lower occupancy costs and certain other economic advantages. We believe that at
the end of existing lease terms, our current leased space can be either relet or replaced by alternate space for lease or purchase that is readily available.

Our
executive, corporate staff and financial offices occupy approximately 1.9 million square feet of leased and owned space in Atlanta, Georgia. At the end of Fiscal 2004, we occupied an
aggregate of approximately 3.9 million square feet, of which approximately 2.2 million square feet is owned and approximately 1.6 million square feet is leased, for divisional
store support centers, subsidiary store support centers and subsidiary customer support centers. At the end of Fiscal 2004, the primary support centers were located in Orange, California; Washington,
D.C.; Tampa, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Arlington Heights, Illinois; Canton, Massachusetts; South Plainfield, New Jersey; Dallas, Texas; Tukwila, Washington; Toronto, Ontario and Quebec, Canada;
Monterrey and Juarez, Mexico; and Shenzhen and Shanghai, China.

At
the end of Fiscal 2004, we utilized approximately 20.1 million square feet of warehousing and distribution space, of which approximately 2.1 million is owned and approximately
18.0 million is leased.
