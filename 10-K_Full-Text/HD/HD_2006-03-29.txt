Introduction

The Home Depot, Inc. is the world's largest home improvement retailer and the second largest retailer in the United States ("U.S."), based on Net Sales for the fiscal
year ended January 29, 2006 ("fiscal 2005"). As of the end of fiscal 2005, we were operating 2,042 stores, most of which are The Home Depot® stores. The following is a description
of our The Home Depot stores, Home Depot Supply and our other store formats.

The
Home Depot stores sell a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement and lawn and garden products and provide a number of services. The Home Depot stores average approximately 105,000
square feet of enclosed space, with approximately 23,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. As of the end of fiscal 2005, we had 1,984 The Home Depot stores located throughout the U.S.
(including the territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands), Canada and Mexico.

In
addition to The Home Depot stores, we have a retail store format that sells products and services primarily for home decorating and remodeling projects called EXPO Design Center and two retail
store formats focused on professional customers called Home Depot Supply and The Home Depot Landscape Supply. As of the end of fiscal 2005, we were operating 34 EXPO Design Center stores, three Home
Depot Supply stores and 11 The Home Depot Landscape Supply stores. We also have two The Home Depot Floor Stores located in Texas and Florida that primarily sell flooring products.

In
addition to our retail stores, our business also includes Home Depot Supply. Home Depot Supply distributes products and sells installation services primarily to professional business contractors,
businesses and municipalities and generally operates in the following three areas:

•

Maintenance, Repair and Operations ("MRO")

supplies maintenance, repair and operating products primarily to multi-family
housing, hospitality and lodging facilities. Included under MRO are National Waterworks, Inc. and Apex Supply Company, Inc. National Waterworks


provides
a wide range of water and wastewater transmission products through 137 branches in 36 states. Apex Supply is a wholesale supplier of plumbing, HVAC, appliances and other related professional
products with 25 locations in the Southeast. MRO also distributes its products through 20 distribution centers located in 14 states.

•

Builder

provides products and arranges installation services for production home builders through 37 locations in 14 states.
Builder also includes Williams Bros. Lumber Company, LLC, a supplier of lumber and building materials to home builders through 16 branches in Georgia.

•

Professional Supply

includes various brands, such as White Cap Construction and Contractors' Warehouse. White Cap
Construction distributes specialty hardware, tools and materials to construction contractors through 103 branches in 23 states. Contractors' Warehouse caters to small contractors and remodeling
tradesmen through eight retail stores located in California.

In
January 2006, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Hughes Supply, a leading distributor of construction, repair and maintenance products, for aggregate consideration of
approximately $3.5 billion. Upon closing, Hughes Supply will be part of Home Depot Supply.

The
Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate office) is located at 2455 Paces Ferry Road, N.W., Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our
telephone number is (770) 433-8211.

We
maintain an Internet website at www.homedepot.com. We make available on our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports to shareholders, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5 as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such documents with, or
furnishing such documents to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We
have included our website addresses throughout this filing only as textual references. The information contained on our websites is not incorporated by reference into this
Form 10-K.

Retail Businesses

The Home Depot Stores

Operating Strategy.

Our operating strategy is to offer a broad assortment of high-quality merchandise
and services at competitive prices using knowledgeable, service-oriented personnel and strong marketing and credit promotions. We believe that our associates' knowledge of products and home
improvement techniques and applications is very important to our marketing approach and our ability to maintain and enhance customer satisfaction.

Customers.

The Home Depot stores serve three primary customer groups:

•

Do-It-Yourself ("D-I-Y") Customers:

These customers are typically home owners
who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. To complement the expertise of our associates, The Home Depot stores offer "how-to" clinics taught by associates
and merchandise vendors.

•

Do-It-For-Me ("D-I-F-M") Customers:

These customers
are typically home owners who purchase materials themselves and hire third parties to complete the project and/or installation. We arrange for the installation of a variety of The Home Depot products
through qualified independent contractors.

•

Professional Customers:

These customers are professional remodelers, general contractors, repairmen and tradesmen. In many
stores, we offer a variety of programs to these customers, including additional delivery and will-call services, dedicated staff, extensive merchandise selections and expanded credit
programs, all of which we believe increase sales to this group.


Products.

A typical The Home Depot store stocks 35,000 to 45,000 products during the year, including both national
brand name and proprietary items. The following table shows the percentage of revenues of each major product group (and related services) for each of the last three fiscal years:

We
buy our store merchandise from suppliers located throughout the world and are not dependent on any single supplier. Most of our merchandise is purchased directly from manufacturers, which
eliminates "middleman" costs. We believe that competitive sources of supply are readily available for substantially all of the products we sell in The Home Depot stores.

To
complement and enhance our product selection, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of
well-recognized brand names. During fiscal 2005, we offered a number of proprietary and exclusive brands across a wide range of departments including, but not limited to, Behr Premium
Plus® paint, Charmglow® gas grills, Hampton Bay® lighting, Mills Pride® cabinets, Vigoro® lawn care products, Husky® hand tools,
RIDGID® and Ryobi® power tools, Pegasus® faucets, Traffic Master® carpet, Glacier Bay® bath fixtures and Veranda® decking
products. We may consider additional strategic alliances and relationships with other suppliers and will continue to assess opportunities to expand the range of products available under brand names
that are exclusive to The Home Depot.

In
2005, innovative and distinctive products continued to be a growth driver supporting our merchandising strategy. The following successes helped differentiate The Home Depot in the marketplace:

•

An
enhanced grill lineup led by our proprietary Charmglow® brand and the exclusive Ducane Stainless Steel Grills;

•

Flooring
innovation through our DuPont RealTouch Elite Laminate Flooring;

•

Introduction
of LG appliances and a broadened assortment of Maytag and GE products;

•

Expanded
patio lineup led by our proprietary Hampton Bay® set;

•

Broadened
assortment of paint, including Colores Origenes, Bellagio faux paint, and the Ralph Lauren metallic and suede paint;

•

Innovative
products from Ryobi®, including the Ryobi One+ System™, Ryobi Multitaskit™ and Ryobi Gas Pressure Washer; and

•

Growing
power tool lineup, including the introduction of exclusive Makita and Milwaukee lithium-ion power tools for professional and D-I-Y customers.

We
maintain a global sourcing merchandise program to source high-quality products directly from manufacturers. This gives our customers a broader selection of innovative products and
better value, while enhancing our gross margin. Our product development merchants travel internationally to identify opportunities to purchase items directly for our stores. Additionally, we have two
sourcing offices located in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China, and have a quality assurance engineer located in Milan,


Italy.
We also have product development merchants, as well as a sourcing office, in Monterrey, Mexico. These initiatives enable us to improve product features and quality, to import products not
currently available to our customers and to offer products at a lower price than would otherwise be available if purchased from third-party importers. We currently source products from more than 600
factories in approximately 35 countries.

Services.

The Home Depot and EXPO Design Center stores offer a variety of installation services. These services
target D-I-F-M customers who select and purchase products and installation of those products from us. These installation programs include products such as
carpeting, flooring, cabinets, countertops and water heaters. In addition, we provide professional installation of a number of products sold through our in-home sales programs, such as
generators and furnace and central air systems. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, THD At-Home Services, Inc. and Home Depot Installation Services, Inc., sell and install our
roofing, siding and window programs. With the exception of Home Depot Installation Services, Inc., which employs its own qualified installers, The Home Depot's installation services are
provided by qualified independent contractors throughout the U.S. and Canada. We also arrange for the provision of flooring, countertop, cabinet and window covering installation services to production
home builders through our Creative Touch Interiors brand. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we extended our services business by acquiring Chem-Dry, the world's largest carpet and
upholstery cleaning franchisor. Chem-Dry has nearly 4,000 franchises worldwide, including 2,500 in the U.S.

Store Growth

United States

.    At the end of fiscal 2005, we were operating 1,793 The Home Depot stores in the U.S., including the territories of
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. During fiscal 2005, we opened 140 new The Home Depot stores, including four relocations, in the U.S. Although these new store openings occurred primarily in
existing markets, we continued our geographic expansion by opening stores in a number of new markets.

To
increase customer service levels, gain incremental sales and enhance long-term market penetration, we often open new stores near the edge of market areas served by existing stores.
While these openings may initially have a negative impact on comparable store sales growth, we believe this "cannibalization" strategy increases customer satisfaction and our overall market share by
reducing delays in shopping, increasing utilization by existing customers and attracting new customers to more convenient locations. During fiscal 2005, we believe that approximately 20% of our stores
were cannibalized by certain of our new stores.

Canada

.    At
the end of fiscal 2005, we were operating 137 The Home Depot stores in ten Canadian provinces. Of these stores, 21 were opened during fiscal 2005,
including one relocation.

Mexico

.    At
the end of fiscal 2005, we were operating 54 stores in Mexico. Of these stores, 10 were opened during fiscal 2005.

China.

At
the end of fiscal 2004, we entered into an arrangement to lease commercial office space in Shanghai to support a retail initiative in China. We are
currently pursuing our strategy for entry into the China home improvement marketplace.

EXPO Design Center Stores

EXPO Design Center stores are designed to be a complete home decorating and remodeling resource for middle- to upper- income D-I-F-M
customers by offering interior design products for kitchens, baths, appliances and flooring, as well as products for lighting, decorating and storage and organization projects, beyond those available
in The Home Depot stores. In each of the 34 EXPO Design Center stores, customers are also offered complete project management and installation services through


associates
who have expertise in designing, planning and completing decorating and remodeling projects.

Its
primary website is located at www.homedepot.com. This site offers an assortment of products available for sale, information about its products and projects, calculators to estimate the amount and
kinds of materials needed to complete a project, as well as information about The Home Depot (including store locations and hours of operation) and links to other Home Depot Direct on-line
businesses. The focus of this website is on providing products, information and customer service. We believe our Internet site provides us with an opportunity to build relationships with, and educate,
our customers, improve service, and provide convenient shopping from home and increase store sales.

Through
www.homedepot.com, Home Depot Direct offers an assortment of over 30,000 items for sale. These items are selected based on their potential for on-line sales. Managing product
selection and pricing nationally allows it to promote the same product and price to all visitors to its websites and allows Home Depot Direct to leverage certain on-line marketing channels
that reach across many or all The Home Depot store pricing markets.

During
fiscal 2005, Home Depot Direct continued to enhance the content of www.homedepot.com to describe each of the installation services The Home Depot offers and the capability to allow potential
customers to conveniently sign up on-line for in-home consultations. We anticipate continuing to improve the quality and quantity of services-related content
on-line.

Home
Depot Direct manages other websites in support of the various The Home Depot brands and businesses. The Canadian website, www.homedepot.ca, provides an assortment of products available for sale
online in Canada, a store locator, and information on The Home Depot and its Canadian services. The Canadian website is bilingual to service The Home Depot customers in Canada's two official

Store Support Services

Information Technologies.

During fiscal 2005, we continued to improve our technology capabilities by opening a
second technology center, located in Austin, Texas. In addition to providing redundancy, the center allows for growth and expansion. The center currently houses engineers, software developers and
computer operation staff.

In
fiscal 2005, we completed the rollout of back-end scanned receiving to all U.S. and Canadian stores, which allows us to simplify, standardize and automate how we receive product. We
commenced vendor certification for certified receiving. We continued installation of self-checkout registers, which, as of the end of fiscal 2005, were in 1,272 stores and we grew
centralized automatic replenishment to 20% of store sales. We also implemented a Special Order Services Initiative pilot in 285 stores and we introduced new mobile cart functionality in all stores.

While
our technology investments have been primarily focused in our stores, we invested in technology improvements in other areas. During fiscal 2005, we implemented new financial systems for our
Mexico retail operations, upgraded our call centers, improved our websites and launched several new direct-to-consumer brands.

Associate Development.

At the end of fiscal 2005, we employed approximately 345,000 associates, of whom
approximately 26,000 were salaried, with the remainder compensated on an hourly or temporary basis. Approximately 68% of our associates are employed on a full-time basis. We believe that
our employee relations are very good. To attract and retain qualified personnel, we seek to maintain competitive salary and wage levels in each market we serve.

We
develop our training programs in a continuing effort to service the needs of our customers and associates. These programs, including mandatory product knowledge training classes, are designed to
increase associates' knowledge of merchandising departments and products, and to educate, develop and test the skills of our associates. Because we primarily promote or relocate current associates to
serve as managers and assistant managers for new stores, training and assessment of our associates is essential to our growth. Our district managers and store managers typically meet with our human
resources managers to discuss the development of assistant managers and department heads.

We
have implemented programs in our stores and divisional offices to ensure that we hire and promote the most qualified associates in a non-discriminatory way. One of the most significant
programs we have is our annual Human Resources Review process, which assesses and reviews leaders and teams, succession planning and executive pipeline, high potential associates, staffing, retention,
diversity, training and compliance. The program is closely linked to our Performance Management Process, which evaluates the performance, leadership and potential of all associates. We also maintain a
list of qualified associates who are interested in new assignments and of qualified outside applicants that can be reviewed when positions become available.

Marketing.

We are one of the nation's largest retail advertisers, and utilize a broad range of mass media and
targeted media. We also incorporate major sponsorships into our marketing plan, such as NASCAR®, the U.S. Olympic® team, The Home Depot Center, ESPN College Game
Day®, and a number of home and garden shows. We also utilize marketing arrangements with television shows of


strategic
importance, such as Trading Spaces®, While You Were Out® and This Old House®. We extend our reach and educate our customers through proprietary
publications, such as the

1-2-3

® home improvement book series.

We
execute our marketing campaigns on both a national and local basis. Because our stores are located throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico, we can achieve greater efficiencies than smaller retailers
by using national advertising. At the same time, we tailor our advertising locally to respond to market differences, both in terms of products and the competitive environment. We produce
advertisements in English, Spanish and French-Canadian.

Credit Services.

We offer credit purchase programs through third-party credit providers to professional,
D-I-Y and D-I-F-M customers. In fiscal 2005, approximately 4 million new The Home Depot credit accounts were opened, bringing the
total number of The Home Depot account holders to approximately 16 million. Proprietary credit card sales accounted for approximately 26% of store sales in fiscal 2005. We also offer an
unsecured Home Improvement Loan that gives our customers the opportunity to finance the purchase of products and services in our stores. We believe that this loan program not only supports large
sales, such as kitchen and bath remodels, but also generates incremental sales from our customers.

Intellectual Property.

Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Homer TLC, Inc., we have registered or applied
for registration, in a number of countries, for a variety of internet domain names, service marks and trademarks for use in our businesses, including The Home Depot®; Home Depot Direct;
Hampton Bay® fans, lighting and accessories; Glacier Bay® toilets, sinks and faucets; Pegasus® faucets and bath accessories; Commercial Electric®
lighting fixtures; Workforce® tools, tool boxes and shelving; www.10CrescentLane.com and www.PacesTrading.com. Furthermore, through various acquisitions and filings, we have also obtained
and now maintain patent portfolios relating to certain products and services provided by The Home Depot, and continually seek to patent or otherwise protect selected innovations we incorporate into
our products and business operations. We regard our intellectual property as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our brand, e-commerce, stores and
new areas of business. We are not aware of any facts that could be expected to have a material adverse affect on our intellectual property.

Quality Assurance Program.

We have a quality assurance program for our directly imported globally-sourced products.
Through this program, we have established criteria for supplier and product performance, which measures factors such as product quality and timeliness of shipments. The performance record is made
available to the factories to allow them to strive for improvement. The quality assurance program addresses the following three main components:

•

Factory:
the factory development group ensures all direct import factories are assessed and qualified to manufacture quality products that meet the expectations we have
established, as well as to assess their compliance with our policies;

•

Products:
the product engineering group authorizes laboratories to test products prior to purchase and ensures that qualified inspectors conduct inspections at the factory
to ensure consistent compliance with our requirements, applicable national and international standards, and features determined by our merchants; and

•

Packages:
the package-engineering group authorizes laboratories to test packaging prior to purchase and ensures that qualified inspectors inspect packaging at the factory to
ensure consistent compliance with all relevant requirements.

Logistics.

We use several mechanisms to lower distribution costs and increase our efficiencies. Import distribution
centers process our globally-sourced merchandise. At the end of fiscal 2005, we had 16 import distribution centers located in the U.S. and Canada. At the end of fiscal 2005, we also had 30 lumber
distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada to support the lumber demands of our stores and


transit facilities. At our transit facilities, we receive merchandise from manufacturers and immediately provide transfer onto trucks for delivery to our stores. We believe that the transit
facility network will provide service to approximately 80% of our stores in the continental U.S. by the end of fiscal 2006. We also operate other specialty distribution centers for specific
merchandise needs. The distribution centers and transit facilities allow us to provide high service levels to our stores at relatively low costs. At the end of fiscal 2005, approximately 40% of the
merchandise shipped to our stores was processed through our network of distribution centers and transit facilities. As our networks evolve, we expect to increase the percentage of merchandise
processed by our facilities. The remaining merchandise will be shipped directly from our suppliers to our stores.

In
addition to replenishing merchandise supplies at our stores, we also provide delivery services directly to our customers. We continually assess opportunities to improve our distribution network to
better satisfy the needs of our stores and our customers and to lower costs.

Environmental, Health & Safety ("EH&S").

We are committed to maintaining a safe environment for our
customers and associates, and protecting the environment of the communities in which we do business. Our EH&S function in the field is directed by trained associates focused primarily on execution of
the EH&S programs. Additionally, we have an Atlanta-based team of dedicated EH&S professionals who evaluate, develop, implement and enforce policies, processes and programs on a
Company-wide basis. Our EH&S professionals are responsible for managing our Global EH&S program, which is implemented in partnership with store level associates, store and division
management, and the Human Resources and Merchandising Departments. The primary elements of our EH&S program are (1) establishment of EH&S standards and processes for all aspects of store
operations and merchandising, (2) effective training of appropriate associates on all applicable standards and (3) verifying compliance with established EH&S standards.

Seasonality.

Our business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, our highest volume of sales occurs in our
second fiscal quarter and the lowest volume occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter.

Competition.

Our business is highly competitive, based in part on price, store location, customer service and depth
of merchandise. In each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some
products, we also compete with discount stores, local, regional and national hardware
stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and, to a lesser extent, other retailers. In addition to these entities, our EXPO Design Center stores compete with
specialty design stores or showrooms, some of which are only open to interior design professionals. Moreover, our Home Depot Supply businesses compete with local and regional distributors and
wholesalers and manufacturers that sell products directly to their customer bases. Due to the variety of competition we face, we are unable to precisely measure the impact on our sales by our
competitors. We estimate that our share of the U.S. home improvement and professional supply market is approximately 11% and we believe that we are an effective and significant competitor in our
markets.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The
risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our
historical experience and from results predicted by forward-looking statements made by us related to conditions or events that we anticipate may occur in the future. Those statements may relate to
such matters as Net Sales growth, increases in comparable store sales, impact of cannibalization, commodity price inflation and deflation, implementation of store initiatives, protection of
intellectual property rights, Net Earnings performance, earnings per share, stock-based compensation expense, store openings and closures, payments on commercial paper borrowings, the effect of
adopting certain accounting standards, future financial reporting, financing, margins, return on invested capital, operations after the


closing
of the merger with Hughes Supply, the timing and certainty of closing of the merger with Hughes Supply, the accounting and financial impact of the merger with Hughes Supply, strategic
direction and the demand for our products and services. All forward-looking statements by us are qualified by the risks described below. These risks are not the only risks we face. Our operations
could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or by factors that we currently consider immaterial to our business.

Rising costs, a reduction in the availability of consumer credit, weather and other conditions in North America could adversely affect our costs of
doing business, demand for our products and services and our average ticket price.

Interest rates, fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, consumer credit availability, weather, natural disasters, terrorism and other conditions that adversely
affect consumer demand for
our products and services could adversely affect our financial performance. These and other similar factors could:

•

increase
our costs,

•

cause
our customers to delay undertaking or determine not to undertake new home improvement projects,

•

cause
our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services, and

•

lead
to a decline in average ticket price.

We rely on third party suppliers, and if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, our ability to
timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected.

We buy our store merchandise from suppliers located throughout the world. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy
our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. Our ability to access products also can be adversely affected by political
instability, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and cost and other factors
beyond our control.

If we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products, we may be unable to
effectively execute our strategy to differentiate us from our competitors.

As part of our strategy of differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of
well-recognized brand names. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative
sources for comparable products, we may not be able to effectively execute our strategy of differentiation.

Any inability to open new stores on schedule will delay the contribution of these new stores to our financial performance.

We expect to increase our presence in existing markets and enter new markets. Our ability to open new stores will depend primarily on our ability to:

•

identify
attractive locations,

•

negotiate
leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms,

•

attract
and train qualified employees, and

•

manage
pre-opening expenses, including construction costs.


Our
ability to open new stores also will be affected by environmental regulations, local zoning issues and other laws related to land use. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors
will affect our ability to open stores on schedule, which will delay the impact of these new stores on our financial performance.

The implementation of our technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and our technology initiatives might not provide the
anticipated benefits or might fail.

We have made and will continue to make significant technology investments both in our stores and in our administrative functions. Our technology initiatives are designed to
streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high quality service to our customers and to provide our customers a better in-store experience. The cost and
potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of our technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. In addition, our new or
upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the technology might fail altogether.

We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for
our products and services and our market share.

It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond
to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and home improvement needs
could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share.

The inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, sales and profit margins.

Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and
international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our
sales and profit margins.

If we cannot successfully identify and complete acquisition opportunities and integrate the acquired businesses, we may be unable to successfully
execute our expansion strategy.

The success of our expansion strategy depends, in part, on our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, complete acquisitions on financially attractive terms
and integrate them with our other
businesses. Integration of our acquisitions presents significant challenges and risks to our business, including:

•

distraction
of management from regular business concerns,

•

assimilation
and retention of employees and customers of the acquired business,

•

integration
of technologies, services and products, and

•

achievement
of appropriate internal control over financial reporting.

There
is no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the risks associated with acquiring and integrating other businesses.


If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in expanding our international
operations.

Our expansion strategy includes expansion of our operations in existing and new international markets by selective acquisitions, strategic alliances and the opening of new
stores. Our ability to successfully execute our expansion strategy in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in expanding our U.S. operations. In addition, our
international expansion may be adversely affected by our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs, legal and regulatory constraints, political and
economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. Risks inherent in our international operations also include,
among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency
exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations.

Our success depends upon our ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified associates.

To be successful, we must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified associates while controlling related labor costs. Our ability to control
labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs. In addition, many of our associates are in hourly positions with historically
high turnover rates. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these associates and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. We also depend on our
executives and other key associates for our success. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future.

Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could
significantly affect our financial results.

Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are
relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, inventories, self-insurance and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates
and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported
or expected financial performance.

Increased competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share.

Our business is highly competitive, based principally on price, store location, customer service and depth of merchandise. In each of the markets we serve, there are a number
of other home improvement stores, electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses and lumber yards. With respect to some products, we also compete with discount stores, local, regional and
national hardware stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores and other retailers. In addition, we compete with specialty design stores or showrooms, some of which
are only open to interior design professionals, local and regional distributors, and wholesalers and manufacturers that sell products directly to their customer bases. Moreover, our Home Depot Supply
businesses compete with local and regional distributors and wholesalers and manufacturers that sell products directly to their customer bases. Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our
competitors could affect prices or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these pressures, our financial performance and our market share could
be adversely affected.


We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty,
some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs

.

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, including consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. We cannot predict the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other
contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by government authorities, with certainty. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies
could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money. Additionally, defending against these
lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources from other matters.

Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal, state or local regulations.

Changes in the federal, state or local minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business. In
addition, changes in federal, state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products could increase our costs of doing business.

Of
our 2,042 stores, at fiscal 2005 year end approximately 87% were owned (including those owned subject to a ground lease) consisting of approximately 186.6 million square feet, and
approximately 13% of such stores were leased consisting of approximately 28.2 million square feet. In recent years, we have increased the relative percentage of new stores that are owned. We
generally prefer to own stores because of greater operating control and flexibility, generally lower occupancy costs and certain other economic advantages.

Our
executive, corporate staff, divisional staff and financial offices occupy approximately 1.9 million square feet of leased and owned space in Atlanta, Georgia. At the end of fiscal 2005, we
occupied an aggregate of approximately 4.2 million square feet, of which approximately 2.3 million square feet is owned and approximately 1.9 million square feet is leased, for
divisional store support centers, subsidiary store support centers and subsidiary customer support centers. At the end of fiscal 2005, our primary support centers were located in Orange, California;
Washington, D.C.; Tampa, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Arlington Heights, Illinois; Canton, Massachusetts; South Plainfield, New Jersey; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Tukwila, Washington; Toronto,
Ontario and Quebec, Canada; Monterrey and Juarez, Mexico; and Shenzhen and Shanghai, China.

At
the end of fiscal 2005, we utilized approximately 31.2 million square feet of warehousing and distribution space, of which approximately 3.2 million is owned and approximately
28.0 million is leased.

We
believe that at the end of existing lease terms, our current leased space can be either relet or replaced by alternate space for lease or purchase that is readily available.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

In
August 2005, the Company received an informal request from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission for information related to the Company's
return-to-vendor policies and procedures. The Company has responded to this and subsequent requests and continues to fully cooperate with the SEC staff. The SEC has informed
the Company that the informal inquiry is not an indication that any violations of law have occurred. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of this matter, it does not expect that this
informal inquiry will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or its results of operations.

In
compliance with SEC disclosure requirements, the environmental proceedings set forth below involve potential monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome
of these proceedings, it does not expect any such outcome to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or its results of operations.

In
January 2003, Home Depot U.S.A. Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, received a request for information from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") regarding
alleged pollutant discharges during construction activities at certain The Home Depot stores. The EPA subsequently referred this matter to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ"). The DOJ and the
Company are currently discussing settlement of this matter.

In
April 2005, the Company received subpoenas from the State of New York's Office of Attorney General seeking documents and testimony related to the sale and handling of pesticides. The Company


is
cooperating fully with the Office of Attorney General and believes it is indemnified if monetary sanctions are imposed.

In
July 2005, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, California, seeking documents and information relating to the Company's
handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. California state and local government authorities are also investigating this matter. In January 2006, the Company received an administrative
subpoena from the District Attorney of Riverside County, California seeking records and documents in connection with such investigation. The Company is cooperating fully with the respective
authorities.

These amounts include repurchases pursuant to the Company's 1997 and 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plans (the "Plans"). Under the Plans, participants may exercise stock options by
surrendering shares of common stock that the participants already own as payment of the exercise price. Participants in the Plans may also surrender shares as payment of applicable tax withholding on
the vesting of restricted stock and deferred share awards. Shares so surrendered by participants in the Plans are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plans and applicable award agreement and not
pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. For the quarter ended January 29, 2006, the following shares of The Home Depot common stock were surrendered by participants in the
Plans and included in the total number of shares purchased: Oct. 31, 2005 – Nov. 27, 2005 – 23,671 shares at an average price per share of $41.86;

2006 – 24,190 shares at an average price per share of $41.40.

approved
purchases up to $11.0 billion. On February 23, 2006, the Board authorized an additional $1.0 billion in common stock repurchases for a total authorization of $12.0 billion.
The program does not have a prescribed expiration date.

Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data

For fiscal year ended January 29, 2006 ("fiscal 2005"), we reported Net Earnings of $5.8 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.72 compared to Net Earnings
of $5.0 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.26 for fiscal year ended January 30, 2005 ("fiscal 2004"). Net Sales increased 11.5% to $81.5 billion for fiscal 2005 from

technology. Significant merchandising enhancements in fiscal 2005 include:

•

An
enhanced grill lineup led by our proprietary Charmglow® brand and the exclusive Ducane Stainless Steel Grills;

Flooring
innovation through our DuPont RealTouch Elite Laminate Flooring;

•

Introduction
of LG appliances and a broadened assortment of Maytag and GE products;

•

Expanded
patio lineup led by our proprietary Hampton Bay® set;

•

Broadened
assortment of paint, including Colores Origenes, Bellagio faux paint, and the Ralph Lauren metallic and suede paint;

Innovative
products from Ryobi®, including the Ryobi One+ System™, Ryobi Multitaskit™ and Ryobi Gas Pressure Washer; and

•

Growing
power tool lineup, including the introduction of exclusive Makita and Milwaukee lithium-ion power tools for professional and
do-it-yourself customers.

Our
store modernization efforts included improved signage, point-of-purchase information and merchandise resets across a variety of categories. During fiscal 2005, we also
achieved the following accomplishments related to our technology initiatives:

•

Completed
the rollout of our back-end scanned receiving to all stores in the United States ("U.S.") and Canada;

•

Commenced
vendor certification for certified receiving;

•

Continued
installation of self-check out registers, in 1,272 stores at the end of fiscal 2005;

•

Grew
centralized automatic replenishment to 20% of store sales; and

•

Implemented
the new in-store Special Order Services Initiative pilot in 285 stores.

These
investments in our business are paying off as evidenced by improvement in key operating performance measurements, including average ticket, which increased 5.6% to a record $57.98 for fiscal
2005.

We
invested $3.9 billion in capital expenditures during fiscal 2005 for store modernization and technology as well as for 179 new store openings. We further extended our business by offering a
variety of installation and home maintenance programs to our do-it-for-me customers through our stores. Our services revenue increased 21.4% to $4.3 billion
for fiscal 2005. We saw sustained growth in categories such as countertops, roofing, kitchens, windows and HVAC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we extended our services business by
acquiring Chem-Dry, the world's largest carpet and


upholstery
cleaning franchisor. Chem-Dry has nearly 4,000 franchises worldwide, including 2,500 in the U.S.

We
opened 179 new stores in fiscal 2005, including five relocations, and closed 22 stores, bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2005 to 2,042 compared to 1,890 at the end of fiscal
2004. As of the end of fiscal 2005, 191 of our stores were located in Canada and Mexico compared to 161 at the end of fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, we closed 20 of our EXPO Design Center ("EXPO")
stores, four of which are being converted to The Home Depot store format. We recorded $91 million of asset impairment and lease obligation charges in Selling, General and Administrative Expense
in fiscal 2005 related to the disposition of our interest in the underlying real estate and store conversions. Additionally, we recorded $29 million of expense in Cost of Sales related to
inventory markdowns in fiscal 2005. Affected EXPO customers are being served by existing The Home Depot and EXPO stores. In fiscal 2005, we also closed two Home Depot Supply stores which did not have
a material impact on our financial results. In fiscal 2005, we increased our offerings on www.homedepot.com to over 30,000 products; the site now averages 3 million hits per week. Additionally,
we launched two unique direct-to-customer brands: 10 Crescent Lane
(www.10CrescentLane.com) and Paces Trading Company (www.PacesTrading.com) which offer quality home décor and lighting options, respectively, through innovative new catalogs and
e-commerce sites.

We
have expanded our business by capturing a growing share of the professional residential, commercial and heavy construction markets, which operate under Home Depot Supply. As part of this expansion
in fiscal 2005, we completed 18 acquisitions that operate under Home Depot Supply, including National Waterworks, Inc. ("National Waterworks"), the nation's leading distributor of products used
to build, repair and maintain water and wastewater transmission systems, and Williams Bros. Lumber Company, a leading supplier of lumber and building materials. In total for fiscal 2005, we completed
21 acquisitions and the total cash paid for businesses acquired in fiscal 2005 was $2.5 billion. In January 2006, we announced our intent to acquire Hughes Supply, Inc. ("Hughes
Supply" NYSE "HUG"), a leading distributor of construction and repair products. We expect to complete this acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

We
generated $6.5 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2005. We used this cash flow to fund, in part, $3.9 billion in capital expenditures, $2.5 billion for acquisitions
and $3.9 billion of dividends and share repurchases. At the end of fiscal 2005, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 9.9%, reflecting the
August 2005 issuance of $1.0 billion of 4


/


% Senior Notes due August 15, 2010. Our return on invested capital (computed on beginning long-term debt and
equity for the trailing four quarters) was 22.4% compared to 21.5% for fiscal 2004, a 90 basis point improvement.


We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of
each of the items presented as follows is important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. We operate in one operating segment and believe the information presented in our
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides an understanding of our operating segment, our operations and our financial condition.

Results of Operations

For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with
the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Annual Report.

Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004

Net Sales

Net
Sales for fiscal 2005 increased 11.5% to $81.5 billion from $73.1 billion for fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 Net Sales growth was driven by an increase in comparable store sales of 3.8%,
sales from new stores opened during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and sales from our newly acquired businesses. Assuming the acquisition of Hughes Supply closes in the first quarter of 2006, we expect
sales growth of 14% to 17% for fiscal 2006, driven by comparable store sales growth, sales from new stores opened during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 and sales from newly acquired businesses, including
Hughes Supply.

The
increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2005 reflects a number of factors. The retail stores contributed 3.0% of comparable store sales growth and Home Depot Supply contributed 80 basis
points of comparable store sales growth. In the retail stores, our average ticket, which increased 5.6%
to a record $57.98, increased in all selling departments and our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2005 was positive in 9 of 10 selling departments. Building materials had the strongest
comparable store sales increase through sales growth of gypsum, roofing, concrete and insulation, due in part to the impact of one of the most destructive hurricane seasons in modern U.S. history. We
experienced strong comparable store sales growth in kitchen and bath driven by continued growth in appliances and kitchen installations. We also experienced strong comparable store sales in our Pro
categories, including plumbing, electrical and hardware in fiscal 2005. The impact of cannibalization partially offset our fiscal 2005 comparable store sales growth.

In
order to meet our customer service objectives, we strategically open stores near market areas served by existing stores ("cannibalize") to enhance service levels, gain incremental sales and
increase market penetration. As of the end of fiscal 2005, certain new stores cannibalized approximately 20% of our existing stores and we estimate that store cannibalization reduced fiscal 2005
comparable store sales by approximately 1.8%. Additionally, we believe that our sales performance has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter
in various markets. However, due to the highly-fragmented U.S. home improvement and professional supply industry, in which we estimate our market share is approximately 11%, measuring the impact on
our sales by our competitors is extremely difficult.

The
growth in Net Sales for fiscal 2005 reflects growth in services revenue, which increased 21.4% to $4.3 billion for fiscal 2005 from $3.6 billion for fiscal 2004. The growth in
services revenue was driven by strength in a number of areas including countertops, roofing, kitchens, windows and HVAC. We continued to drive our services programs, which focus primarily on providing
products and services to our do-it-for-me customers. We also arrange for the provision of flooring, countertop, cabinet, and window covering installation services
to production home builders through our Creative Touch Interiors brand. Our services revenue is expected to benefit from the growing percentage of aging "baby-boomers" as they rely more
heavily on installation services.

We
continue to invest in our stores to improve store efficiency and the overall customer shopping experience. In fiscal 2005, we completed the rollout of our back-end automation and
re-engineering ("BEAR") project to all stores in the U.S. and Canada. Among other things, this initiative improves operational execution and productivity through the automation of our
receiving process in the stores, enabling us to reallocate resources to the selling floor. During fiscal 2005, we continued the implementation or expansion of a number of other in-store
initiatives. We continued the installation of


self-checkout
registers, in 1,272 stores as of the end of fiscal 2005, grew our centralized automatic replenishment program, commenced vendor certification for certified receiving and
implemented an in-store Special Order Services Initiative pilot in 285 stores as of the end of fiscal 2005. We believe these initiatives will enhance our customers' shopping experience as
they are fully implemented in our stores.

Gross Profit

Gross
Profit increased 11.8% to $27.3 billion for fiscal 2005 from $24.4 billion for fiscal 2004. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales increased 10 basis points to 33.5% for fiscal
2005, the highest annual rate in our Company's history. Our gross profit margin was impacted by a number of factors during the year including a change in the mix of merchandise sold, markdowns taken
in connection with our decision to close or convert 20 EXPO stores, the increasing penetration of our Home Depot Supply business and the cost of our deferred interest programs. Through our private
label credit card we offer no interest/no payment programs. The deferred interest associated with these programs is included in Cost of Sales. We believe these programs deliver long-term
benefits, including higher average ticket and customer loyalty. For fiscal 2005, the penetration of our private label credit sales was 25.6% compared to 24.1% for fiscal 2004.

Operating Expenses

Operating
Expenses increased 8.8% to $18.0 billion for fiscal 2005 from $16.5 billion for fiscal 2004. Operating Expenses as a percent of Net Sales were 22.0% for fiscal 2005 compared to
22.6% for fiscal 2004.

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A") increased 8.1% to $16.5 billion for fiscal 2005 from $15.3 billion for fiscal 2004. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 20.2% for
fiscal 2005 compared to 20.9% for fiscal 2004. The reduction of SG&A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2005 was primarily a result of continued focus on cost take-out initiatives and
driving productivity gains throughout the Company. We also continue to see benefits from our private label credit card, which carries a lower discount rate than other forms of credit, like bank cards.
In fiscal 2005, we recorded $52 million of income related to gift card breakage as a reduction of SG&A. Fiscal 2005 was the first year in which we recognized gift card breakage, and therefore,
the amount recognized in fiscal 2005 includes the breakage income related to gift cards sold since the inception of our gift card program. While we expect to continue to recognize gift card breakage
in future periods, the amounts will be significantly less than in fiscal 2005 due to the one-time multi-year inclusion in fiscal 2005. Finally, for fiscal 2005, we recorded
$91 million of impairment charges and expense related to lease obligations in connection with our decision to close or convert 20 EXPO stores.

Depreciation
and Amortization increased 17.9% to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2005 from $1.2 billion for fiscal 2004. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 1.8% for
fiscal 2005 and 1.7% for fiscal 2004. The increase as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to our investments in store modernization and technology.

Interest, net

In
fiscal 2005, we recognized $81 million of net Interest Expense compared to $14 million in fiscal 2004. Net Interest Expense as a percent of Net Sales was 0.1% for fiscal 2005 and less
than 0.1% for fiscal 2004. Interest Expense increased to $143 million for fiscal 2005 from $70 million for fiscal 2004 primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the
August 2005 $1.0 billion issuance of 4


/


% Senior Notes and the September 2004 $1.0 billion issuance of 3


/


% Senior Notes. Interest and
Investment Income increased 10.7% to $62 million for fiscal 2005 from $56 million for fiscal 2004 due primarily to a higher interest rate environment.


Provision for Income Taxes

Our
combined federal and state effective income tax rate increased to 37.1% for fiscal 2005 from 36.8% for fiscal 2004. The majority of the increase in our effective income tax rate was due to an
increase in the state effective tax rate in fiscal 2005.

The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJC Act") provides a one-time 85% dividends-received deduction that applies to qualified cash dividends received from controlled foreign
corporations if the funds are reinvested in the United States. The deduction can result in an effective income tax rate of 5.25% on the repatriation of foreign earnings, a rate much lower than the
normal statutory tax rate of 35%. The Company has determined that it will not repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the AJC Act.

The
AJC Act also provides a new deduction for qualified domestic production activities. When fully phased-in, the deduction will be up to 9% of the lesser of qualified production
activities income or taxable income. Because this provision is targeted toward manufacturing activities, the Company does not expect to recognize a material benefit in the current or future tax years.

Diluted Earnings per Share

Diluted
Earnings per Share were $2.72 and $2.26 for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Diluted Earnings per Share were favorably impacted in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 as a result of the
repurchase of shares of our common stock under our $11.0 billion repurchase authorization. Over the past four fiscal years, we have repurchased approximately 277 million shares of our
common stock for a total of $9.7 billion. On February 23, 2006 our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.0 billion for share repurchases, bringing our total authorization
to $12.0 billion. In fiscal 2006, we estimate Diluted Earnings per Share growth of 10% to 14%.

Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2004 ("fiscal 2003")

Net Sales

Net
Sales for fiscal 2004 increased 12.8% to $73.1 billion from $64.8 billion for fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2004 Net Sales growth was driven by an increase in comparable store sales of 5.4%,
sales from the 183 net new stores opened during fiscal 2004, sales from the 175 net new stores opened during fiscal 2003 and sales from our newly acquired businesses.

The
increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2004 reflects a number of factors. Our average ticket, which increased 7.3% to $54.89, increased in all selling departments and our comparable store
sales growth in fiscal 2004 was positive in all selling departments. We experienced strong comparable store sales increases in building materials due in part to the impact of several hurricanes in the
Southeastern U.S. Lumber was another strong category during fiscal 2004, driven primarily by commodity price inflation. Additionally, we had strong sales growth in our kitchen and bath categories,
driven by
appliances, bath fixtures, vanities and sinks. Finally, our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2004 reflects the impact of cannibalization. As of the end of fiscal 2004, certain new stores
cannibalized approximately 17% of our existing stores and we estimate that store cannibalization reduced fiscal 2004 comparable store sales by approximately 2.2%.

The
growth in Net Sales for fiscal 2004 reflects growth in services revenue, which increased 28% to $3.6 billion for fiscal 2004 from $2.8 billion for fiscal 2003, driven by strength in
a number of areas including countertops, HVAC, kitchens and our flooring companies.


Gross Profit

Gross
Profit increased 18.7% to $24.4 billion for fiscal 2004 from $20.6 billion for fiscal 2003, an increase of 167 basis points. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 33.4% for
fiscal 2004, compared to 31.8% for fiscal 2003. The adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a
Vendor" ("EITF 02-16"), reduced our Cost of Sales by co-op advertising allowances of $891 million, or 122 basis points, in fiscal 2004 and $40 million, or
6 basis points, in fiscal 2003. See section "Impact of the Adoption of EITF 02-16." Excluding the impact of the adoption of EITF 02-16, our Gross Profit as a
percent of Net Sales would have been 32.2% for fiscal 2004 compared with 31.7% for fiscal 2003. Improved inventory management, which resulted in lower shrink levels, contributed 18 basis points of our
increase in Gross Profit. Finally, 33 basis points resulted from benefits arising from a change in merchandising mix, offset by the cost of our deferred interest programs.

Operating Expenses

Operating
Expenses increased 20.2% to $16.5 billion for fiscal 2004 from $13.7 billion for fiscal 2003. Operating Expenses as a percent of Net Sales were 22.6% for fiscal 2004 compared
to 21.2% for fiscal 2003.

SG&A
increased 20.0% to $15.3 billion for fiscal 2004 from $12.7 billion for fiscal 2003. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 20.9% for fiscal 2004 compared to 19.6% for fiscal 2003. The
increase in SG&A in fiscal 2004 includes $1.0 billion of advertising expense related to the adoption of EITF 02-16. Excluding the impact of EITF 02-16,
SG&A increased 12.2% to $14.3 billion, or 19.5% of Net Sales, in fiscal 2004 compared with 19.6% of Net Sales in fiscal 2003. The decrease in SG&A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2004,
excluding the impact of EITF 02-16, was due to an increase in labor productivity and benefits from our private label credit card, which carries a lower discount rate than other
forms of credit, like bank cards. Labor productivity, as measured by sales per labor hour, reached an all-time high in fiscal 2004, as we moved our associates from tasking to selling
activities. This reduction in costs was partially offset by higher expenses associated with incentive programs, like our success sharing program and our management incentive plan and stock-based
compensation expense. In addition, our planned investment in store modernization and technology caused remodel and repair expenses to rise at a faster rate than our Net Sales growth.

Depreciation
and Amortization increased 22.2% to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2004 from $1.0 billion for fiscal 2003. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 1.7% for
fiscal 2004 and 1.6% for fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to our investment in store modernization and technology.

Interest, net

In
fiscal 2004, we recognized $14 million of net Interest Expense compared to $3 million in fiscal 2003. Net Interest Expense as a percent of Net Sales was less than 0.1% for both fiscal
2004 and fiscal 2003. Interest Expense increased 12.9% to $70 million for fiscal 2004 from $62 million for fiscal 2003 primarily due to an increase in outstanding indebtedness and a
reduction in the amount of capitalized interest. Interest Expense also increased due to the addition of $38 million in capital leases during the year. Interest and Investment Income decreased
5.1% to $56 million for fiscal 2004 from $59 million for fiscal 2003 primarily due to a lower interest rate environment.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our
combined federal and state effective income tax rate decreased to 36.8% for fiscal 2004 from 37.1% for fiscal 2003. The majority of this reduction was due to the reversal of a $31 million
valuation


allowance
as we were able to recognize previous capital losses for which no tax benefit had been recorded at the time the capital loss was incurred.

Diluted Earnings per Share

Diluted
Earnings per Share were $2.26 and $1.88 for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. The adoption of EITF 02-16 negatively impacted Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal
2004 by $0.04 per share. Diluted Earnings per Share were favorably impacted in fiscal 2004 as a result of the repurchase of shares of our common stock in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004.

Impact of the Adoption of EITF 02-16

In fiscal 2003, we adopted EITF 02-16 which states that certain cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the
vendor's products or services and should, therefore, be recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales when recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. That presumption is overcome when the
consideration is either a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell the vendor's products or a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor. We receive
consideration in the form of advertising co-op allowances from our vendors pursuant to annual agreements, which are generally on a calendar year basis. As permitted by
EITF 02-16, we elected to apply its provisions prospectively to all agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. Therefore, the impact of us adopting
EITF 02-16 in fiscal 2003 was limited to advertising co-op allowances earned pursuant to vendor agreements entered into in late 2003, which became effective in
January 2004.

The
one-month impact of the adoption of EITF 02-16 in fiscal 2003 resulted in a reduction of Cost of Sales of $40 million, an increase in SG&A of
$47 million and a reduction of Earnings before Provision for Income Taxes of $7 million. The impact on our Diluted Earnings per Share was immaterial.

The
impact of the adoption of EITF 02-16 in fiscal 2004 resulted in a reduction of Cost of Sales of $891 million, an increase in SG&A of $1.0 billion and a reduction
of Earnings before Provision for Income Taxes of $158 million. The impact on our Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2004 was a reduction of $0.04 per share.

EITF 02-16
did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2005 consolidated results of operations or financial condition as of January 29, 2006.

Prior
to the adoption of EITF 02-16 in fiscal 2003, the entire amount of advertising co-op allowances received was offset against advertising expense and resulted in a
reduction of SG&A. We continue to earn certain advertising co-op allowances that are recorded as an offset against advertising expenses as they are reimbursements of specific, incremental
and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors' products. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, net advertising expense was $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $58 million, respectively,
which was recorded in SG&A.


The
following table illustrates the full-year effect on Cost of Sales, Gross Profit, SG&A, Operating Income and Diluted Earnings per Share as if advertising co-op allowances
had always been treated as a reduction of Cost of Sales in accordance with EITF 02-16 (amounts in millions, except per share data):

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash flow generated from operations provides a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2005, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $6.5 billion as compared
to $6.9 billion for fiscal 2004. The decrease in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a reduction in Deferred Income Taxes resulting from the reversal of certain temporary differences and no
increase in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities partially offset by stronger Net Earnings.

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities increased to $4.6 billion for fiscal 2005 from $4.5 billion for fiscal 2004. This increase was due to an increase in Payments for Businesses
Acquired, partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from sales, maturities and purchases of investments. We paid $2.5 billion to complete 21 acquisitions in fiscal 2005, primarily
adding professional service capabilities to Home Depot Supply. In January 2006, we announced our intent to acquire Hughes Supply for aggregate consideration of $3.5 billion. We expect to
complete this acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

Additionally
in fiscal 2005, we had $3.9 billion of Capital Expenditures, allocated as follows: 66% for new stores, 10% for store modernization, 9% for technology and 15% for other initiatives.
In fiscal 2005, we opened 179 new stores, including five relocations.

Net
Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2005 was $1.6 billion compared with $3.1 billion for fiscal 2004. The decrease in Net Cash Used in Financing Activities was primarily due
to the issuance of $1.0 billion of Long-Term Debt in August 2005 and $900 million of Short-Term Debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 under our
commercial paper program. In May 2005, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the future issuance of up to $5.0 billion of debt
securities. In August 2005, we issued $1.0 billion of 4


/


% Senior Notes (see Note 3 in "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements") at a discount of
$5 million. The net proceeds of $995 million were used to pay for a portion of the acquisition price of National Waterworks. Commercial paper borrowings in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2005 supported short-term liquidity needs.


In
February 2005 and August 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in our share repurchase program, bringing the
total authorization by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2002 to $11.0 billion as of January 29, 2006. Pursuant to this authorization, we have repurchased
approximately 277 million shares of our common stock for a total of $9.7 billion as of January 29, 2006. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased approximately 76 million shares
of our common stock for $3.0 billion and during fiscal 2004 we repurchased 84 million shares of our common stock for $3.1 billion. As of January 29, 2006, approximately
$1.3 billion remained under our previously authorized share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.0 billion
bringing the total authorization since the inception of the share repurchase program to $12.0 billion. During fiscal 2005, we also increased dividends paid by 19.2% to $857 million from
$719 million in fiscal 2004.

We
have a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to a maximum of $2.5 billion. In connection with the program, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of
banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. As of January 29, 2006, there was $900 million outstanding under the program. We expect to repay this amount during the first quarter of
2006. The credit facility, which
expires in December 2010, contains various restrictions, none of which is expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.

We
use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is
reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long-Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. As of the end of fiscal 2005, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio was 9.9% compared to 8.9% at the end of fiscal 2004. This increase reflects the net
increase in Long-Term Debt as a result of the August 2005 issuance of 4


/


% Senior Notes due August 15, 2010.

As
of January 29, 2006, we had $807 million in Cash and Short-Term Investments. We believe that our current cash position and cash flow generated from operations should be
sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available
from the $2.5 billion commercial paper program and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing for future acquisitions and other requirements. In March 2006, we used the
remaining availability under our shelf registration statement to issue $1.0 billion of 5.20% Senior Notes due March 1, 2011 and $3.0 billion of 5.40% Senior Notes due
March 1, 2016. We intend to use the proceeds to fund our pending acquisition of Hughes Supply and to refinance our $500 million of 5

Contractual obligations include Short-Term Debt, Long-Term Debt comprised primarily of $2.5 billion of Senior Notes further discussed in "Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" and future minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases used in the normal course of business. The amounts listed do not include aggregate
consideration of $3.5 billion related to our pending acquisition of Hughes Supply, expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 or any debt issued subsequent to the end of fiscal 2005.

(2)

Excludes present value of capital lease obligations of $381 million. Includes $479 million of interest payments and $8 million of unamortized discount.

(3)

Includes $867 million of imputed interest.

(4)

Commercial commitments include letters of credit from certain business transactions, purchase obligations and commitments to purchase store assets. We issue letters
of credit for
insurance programs, purchases of import merchandise inventories and construction contracts. Our purchase obligations consist of commitments for both merchandise and services.

(5)

Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software
acquisition and license
commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. Additionally, we have included a commitment to purchase the
underlying asset under an off-balance sheet lease related to certain stores for $282 million during 2008.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Although we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate
fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition and results of operations. Our primary objective for entering into derivative instruments is to manage our exposure to interest rates, as
well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt.

As
of January 29, 2006 we had, net of discounts, $996 million of 4


/


% Senior Notes, $996 million of 3


/


% Senior Notes and $500 million of


/


% Senior Notes outstanding. The market values of the publicly traded 4


/


%, 3


/


% and 5


/


% Senior Notes as of January 29, 2006,
were approximately $985 million, $976 million and $500 million, respectively. We have several outstanding interest rate


swap
agreements, with notional amounts totaling $475 million, that swap fixed rate interest on our $500 million 5


/


% Senior Notes for variable interest rates equal to
LIBOR plus 30 to 245 basis points and expire on April 1, 2006. At January 29, 2006, the fair market value of these agreements was a liability of $1 million, which is the estimated
amount that we would have paid to settle similar interest rate agreements at current interest rates.

Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices

We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. During fiscal 2005, lumber prices decreased our comparable store sales by
approximately 13 basis points. We do not believe that changing prices for other commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot accurately
determine the precise overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting
policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns
based on our historical return levels. The methodology used is consistent with other retailers. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have
never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted.
When we receive payment from
customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets until the sale or service is complete.

Merchandise Inventories

Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 86% valued under the retail inventory
method and the remainder under the cost method. Retailers like The Home Depot, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail
inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail
value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We
evaluate our inventory valued under the cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued
under the cost method was not material to the Company as of the end of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004.

Independent
physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store, distribution center and Home Depot Supply location to ensure that amounts reflected in the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses
related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, "swell") is the


difference
between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among
other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on
recent shrink results and current trends in the business.

Self-Insurance

We are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, product liability, automobile, workers' compensation and medical claims. Our liability
represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and
actuarial estimates, and is reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate.
While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation, or fluctuations
in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment"
("SFAS 123(R)"). This statement revises SFAS Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123") and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS 123(R) requires all public entities to recognize compensation expense for all share-based payments as measured by the fair value
on the grant date over the requisite service period. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance delaying the effective date of SFAS 123(R), therefore it will
now be effective for The Home Depot in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

Effective
February 3, 2003, we adopted the fair value based method of recording stock-based compensation expense in accordance with SFAS 123. We selected the prospective method of
adoption as described in SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure," and accordingly, stock-based compensation expense was recorded
for all share-based payments granted or modified after the beginning of fiscal 2003. Historically, we have used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to
employees. SFAS 123(R) requires that all share-based payments granted prior to the adoption date that remain unvested at the adoption date also be expensed over the remaining service period. We
currently intend to adopt SFAS 123(R) using the modified-prospective method, therefore in addition to continuing to recognize stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payments
awarded since our adoption of SFAS 123 in fiscal 2003, we will also begin expensing unvested options granted prior to 2003 upon the adoption of SFAS 123(R). We currently estimate the
impact of adopting SFAS 123(R) will be a reduction of Earnings before Provision for Income Taxes of approximately $40 million for fiscal 2006.

In
October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") 13-1, "Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period" ("FSP 13-1"). FSP 13-1
requires rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations. FSP
13-1 becomes effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, and will therefore be effective for The Home Depot in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The
adoption of FSP 13-1 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of January 29, 2006. Our management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 29,

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

The Home Depot, Inc.:

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2006, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of January 29, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of January 29, 2006 and January 30, 2005, and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Stockholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal
years in the three-year period ended January 29, 2006, and our report dated March 22, 2006, except as to note 12 which is as of March 24, 2006, expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

The Home Depot, Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 29, 2006 and January 30, 2005, and the related Consolidated
Statements of Earnings, Stockholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income, and Cash Flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 29, 2006. These
Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
January 29, 2006 and January 30, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 29,
2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective February 3, 2003, the Company changed its method of accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor to
conform to Emerging Issues Task Force No. 02-16 and adopted the fair value method of recording stock-based compensation expense in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal
control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 22, 2006 expressed an unqualified
opinion on management's assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business, Consolidation and Presentation

The Home Depot, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") operate The Home Depot stores, which are full-service, warehouse-style stores averaging approximately
105,000 square feet in size. The stores stock approximately 35,000 to 45,000 different kinds of building materials, home improvement supplies and lawn and garden products that are sold to
do-it-yourself customers, do-it-for-me customers, home improvement contractors, tradespeople and building maintenance professionals. In
addition, the Company operates EXPO Design Center stores ("EXPO"), which offer products and services primarily related to design and renovation projects, The Home Depot Landscape Supply stores, which
service landscape professionals and garden enthusiasts with lawn, landscape and garden products and Home Depot Supply stores and Contractors' Warehouse stores serving primarily professional customers.
The Company also operates The Home Depot Floor Stores, which offer primarily flooring products and installation services. At the end of fiscal 2005, the Company was operating 2,042 stores in total,
which included 1,793 The Home Depot stores, 34 EXPO Design Center stores, 11 The Home Depot Landscape Supply stores, eight Contractors' Warehouse stores, three Home Depot Supply stores and two The
Home Depot Floor Stores in the United States, including the territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands ("U.S."); 137 The Home Depot stores in Canada and 54 The Home Depot stores in Mexico.

Additionally,
Home Depot Supply, through the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries, distributes products and sells installation services primarily to professional business contractors, businesses and
municipalities and operates in three primary areas. Maintenance, Repair and Operations ("MRO") supplies maintenance, repair and operating products primarily to multi-family housing, hospitality and
lodging facilities. The second area, Builder, provides products and arranges installation services for
production home builders. Professional Supply, the third area, distributes specialty hardware, tools and materials to construction contractors. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal Year

The Company's fiscal year is a 52 or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31. Fiscal years ended January 29, 2006 ("fiscal 2005"),
January 30, 2005 ("fiscal 2004") and February 1, 2004 ("fiscal 2003") include 52 weeks.

Use of Estimates

Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables, Short-Term Debt and Accounts Payable approximate fair value due to the short-term
maturities of these financial instruments. The fair value of the Company's investments is discussed under the caption "Short-Term Investments" in this Note 1. The fair value of the
Company's Long-Term Debt is discussed in Note 3.


Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company's Cash and Cash Equivalents are
carried at fair market value and consist primarily of high-grade commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. government agency securities and tax-exempt notes and bonds.

Short-Term Investments

Short-Term Investments at the end of fiscal 2004 are primarily auction rate securities. The interest rates on these securities are typically reset to market
prevailing rates every 35 days or less, and in all cases every 90 days or less, but have longer stated maturities. Short-Term Investments are recorded at fair value based on
current market rates and are classified as available-for-sale. Changes in the fair value are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), net of applicable taxes
in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounts Receivable

The Company has an agreement with a third-party service provider who manages the Company's private label credit card program and directly extends credit to customers. In
addition, certain subsidiaries of the Company extend credit directly to customers in the ordinary course of business. The receivables due from customers were $865 million and
$321 million as of January 29, 2006 and January 30, 2005, respectively. The Company's valuation reserve related to accounts receivable was not material as of January 29,
2006 and January 30, 2005.

Merchandise Inventories

The majority of the Company's Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail
inventory method. As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, the inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain
subsidiaries and distribution centers record Merchandise Inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the cost method. These Merchandise
Inventories represent approximately 14% of the total Merchandise Inventories balance. The Company evaluates the inventory valued using the cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is
carried at the
lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under the cost method was not material to the Company as of the end of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004.

Independent
physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store, distribution center and Home Depot Supply location to ensure that amounts reflected in the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in stores, the Company accrues for estimated losses
related to shrink on a store-by-store basis based on historical shrink results and current trends in the business. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, "swell") is the difference between the
recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things.

Income Taxes

The Company provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and
expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Federal, state and foreign tax benefits are recorded as a reduction of income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing


assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.

The
Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for
financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in the Company's consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these
entities. The Company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries and postpone their remittance indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes
for non-U.S. subsidiaries was recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJC Act") provides a one-time 85% dividends-received deduction that applies to qualified cash dividends received from controlled foreign
corporations if the funds are reinvested in the United States. The deduction can result in an effective income tax rate of 5.25% on the repatriation of foreign earnings, a rate much lower than the
normal
statutory tax rate of 35%. The Company has determined that it will not repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the AJC Act.

The
AJC Act also provides a new deduction for qualified domestic production activities. When fully phased-in, the deduction will be up to 9% of the lesser of qualified production
activities income or taxable income. Because this provision is targeted toward manufacturing activities, the Company does not expect to recognize a material benefit in the current or future tax years.

Depreciation and Amortization

The Company's Buildings, Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold
Improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The Company's Property and
Equipment is depreciated using the following estimated useful lives:

Life

Buildings

10-45 years

Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment

3-20 years

Leasehold Improvements

5-30 years

Capitalized Software Costs

The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life of the software, which is three to six years. These costs are included in Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment in
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.

Revenues

The Company recognizes revenue, net of estimated returns, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. The liability for sales returns is
estimated based on historical return levels. When the Company receives payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount
received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. The Company also records Deferred Revenue for the sale of gift cards and
recognizes this


revenue
upon the redemption of gift cards in Net Sales. Gift card breakage income is recognized based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which the Company
believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote. During fiscal 2005, the Company recognized $52 million of gift card breakage income. Fiscal 2005 was the first year in which the
Company recognized gift card breakage income, and therefore, the amount recognized includes the gift card breakage income related to gift cards sold since the inception of the gift card program. This
income is recorded as other income and is included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings as a reduction in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A").

Services Revenue

Net Sales include services revenue generated through a variety of installation and home maintenance programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for
a project and the Company provides or arranges professional installation. These programs are offered through the Company's stores and focus primarily on providing products and services to
do-it-for-me customers. The Company also arranges for the provision of flooring, countertop, cabinet and window covering installation services to production home
builders through its Creative Touch Interiors brand. Under certain programs, when the Company provides or arranges the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the
installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. The Company recognizes this revenue when the service for the customer is complete.

All
payments received prior to the completion of services are recorded in Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Services revenue, including the impact of deferred revenue,
was $4.3 billion, $3.6 billion and $2.8 billion for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Self-Insurance

The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, product liability, automobile, workers' compensation and medical claims. The expected
ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date is not discounted and is recognized as a liability. The expected ultimate cost of claims is estimated based upon analysis of historical
data and actuarial estimates.

Prepaid Advertising

Television and radio advertising production costs along with media placement costs are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Included in Other Current Assets in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are $42 million and $33 million, respectively, at the end of fiscal 2005 and 2004 relating to prepayments of production costs for print and
broadcast advertising.

Vendor Allowances

The Company currently receives two types of vendor allowances: volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op
allowances for the promotion of vendors' products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. All vendor
allowances are accrued as earned, and those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels are accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases.

In
fiscal 2003, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force No. 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor"
("EITF 02-16"), which states that cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor's products or services and should, therefore,
be characterized as a reduction of Cost of Sales when recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings. That presumption is overcome when the consideration is either a reimbursement of
specific, incremental and identifiable


costs
incurred to sell the vendor's product or a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor. The Company receives consideration in the form of advertising co-op allowances from
its vendors pursuant to annual agreements, which are generally on a calendar year basis. As permitted by EITF 02-16, the Company elected to apply the provisions of
EITF 02-16 prospectively to all agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002.

There
was no material impact to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings or Consolidated Balance Sheets for fiscal 2005. The impact of EITF 02-16 in fiscal 2004 and fiscal
2003 resulted in a reduction of Cost of Sales of $891 million and $40 million, an increase to SG&A of $1.0 billion and $47 million and a reduction to Earnings before
Provision for Income Taxes of $158 million and $7 million, respectively. The impact on the Company's Diluted Earnings per Share was a reduction of $0.04 in fiscal 2004. There was no
material impact on the Company's Diluted Earnings per Share in fiscal 2003.

Volume
rebates and advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product
is sold. Prior to the adoption of EITF 02-16 in January 2004, advertising co-op allowances earned had been offset against advertising expense to the extent of
advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of Cost of Sales.

The
Company continues to earn certain advertising co-op allowances that are recorded as an offset against advertising expense as they are reimbursements of specific, incremental and
identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors' products. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, net advertising expense was $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $58 million, respectively,
which was recorded in SG&A.

Cost of Sales

Cost of Sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed, the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to the Company's stores, locations or
customers, the operating cost of the Company's distribution centers and the cost of deferred interest programs offered through the Company's private label credit card program.

The
cost of handling and shipping merchandise from the Company's stores, locations or distribution centers to the customer is classified as SG&A. The cost of shipping and handling, including internal
costs and payments to third parties, classified as SG&A was $563 million, $499 million and $387 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Cost in Excess of the Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill, but does assess the recoverability of goodwill
in the third quarter of each year by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. The fair values of the Company's identified reporting units were estimated
using the expected present value of discounted cash flows. The Company recorded no impairment charges for fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003.

The
Company amortizes the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range from 1 to 12 years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with
indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each year for impairment and written down to fair value as required. The Company recorded no impairment charges for fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets when management makes the decision to relocate or close a store, or when circumstances indicate the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Losses related to the impairment of long-lived assets are recognized to the extent the sum


of
undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset are less than the asset's carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the future cash flows, a
provision is made to write down the related assets to the estimated net recoverable value. Impairment losses were recorded as a component of SG&A in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Earnings. When a location closes, the Company also recognizes in SG&A the net present value of future lease obligations, less estimated sublease income.

In
fiscal 2005, the Company closed 20 of its EXPO stores, four of which are being converted to The Home Depot store format. In fiscal 2005, the Company charged $91 million to SG&A related to
the
dispositions, of which $78 million was for asset impairment charges and $13 million was for lease obligations. The Company remains contingently liable for future minimum lease payments
related to the affected stores, for which the amounts are not material. Additionally, the Company incurred $29 million of expense in Cost of Sales in fiscal 2005 related to inventory markdowns
in these stores. Affected customers are being served by existing The Home Depot and EXPO stores. In fiscal 2005, the Company also closed two Home Depot Supply stores which did not have a material
impact to the Company's financial results.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective February 3, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value method of recording stock-based compensation expense in accordance with SFAS No. 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"). The Company selected the prospective method of adoption as described in SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure" and accordingly, stock-based compensation expense was recognized related to stock options granted, modified or settled and expense related
to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") after the beginning of fiscal 2003. The fair value of stock options and ESPP as determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model is being expensed over the vesting period of the related stock options and ESPP. Prior to February 3, 2003, the Company elected to account for its stock-based compensation plans under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"), which requires the recording of stock-based compensation expense for some, but not all,
stock-based compensation.

The
per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $12.83, $13.57 and $9.79, respectively. The fair value of these options was determined at the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

In
April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)"), therefore
it will now be effective for The Home Depot in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company intends to adopt SFAS 123(R) using the modified-prospective method, therefore, in addition to
continuing to recognize stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payments awarded since the adoption of SFAS 123 in fiscal 2003, the Company will also begin expensing unvested
options granted prior to 2003 upon the adoption of SFAS 123(R). The Company currently estimates the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R) will be a reduction of Earnings before Provision for
Income Taxes of approximately $40 million for fiscal 2006.

Derivatives

The Company measures its derivatives at fair value and recognizes these assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's primary objective for entering
into derivative instruments is to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. At January 29, 2006, the Company
had several outstanding interest rate swaps, accounted for as fair value hedges, with a notional amount of $475 million that swap fixed rate interest on the Company's $500 million


/


% Senior Notes for variable interest rates equal to LIBOR plus 30 to 245 basis points and expire on April 1, 2006. At January 29, 2006, the fair market value of these
agreements was a liability of $1 million, which is the estimated amount that the Company would have paid to settle similar interest rate swap agreements at current interest rates.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive Income includes Net Earnings adjusted for certain revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are excluded from Net Earnings under generally accepted accounting
principles. Adjustments to Net Earnings are primarily for foreign currency translation adjustments.


Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and Liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and
Expenses are generally translated at a daily exchange rate and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction.

Segment Information

The Company operates within a single operating segment within North America. Net Sales for Canada and Mexico were $5.3 billion, $4.2 billion and
$3.4 billion during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Long-lived assets in Canada and Mexico totaled $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion as of January 29,
2006 and January 30, 2005, respectively.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year.

2.     INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The
Company's intangible assets at the end of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, which are included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, consisted of the following (amounts in
millions):

assets recorded as of January 29, 2006 is $60 million, $59 million, $55 million, $52 million and $48 million for fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2010,
respectively.

3.     DEBT

As
of January 29, 2006, the Company had $900 million of Short-Term Debt outstanding under its commercial paper program. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company
increased the maximum capacity for borrowing under its commercial paper program to $2.5 billion as well as increased the related back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks
to $2.0 billion. Since the initial borrowing on January 17, 2006, the maximum amount outstanding under the commercial paper program was $900 million and the weighted average
interest rate was 4.3%. The credit facility, which expires in December 2010, contains various restrictions, none of which is expected to materially impact the Company's liquidity or capital
resources.


The Company's Long-Term Debt at the end of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 consisted of the following (amounts in millions):

redemption date. The redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the
remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. The Company is generally not limited under these indentures in its ability to incur additional indebtedness nor required to maintain
financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. However, the indentures governing the Senior Notes contain various restrictive covenants, none of which are expected to impact the
Company's liquidity or capital resources. The Senior Notes are not subject to sinking fund requirements.

Interest
Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings is net of interest capitalized of $51 million, $40 million and $50 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.


Maturities
of Long-Term Debt are $513 million for fiscal 2006, $16 million for fiscal 2007, $300 million for fiscal 2008, $1.0 billion for fiscal 2009,
$1.0 billion for fiscal 2010 and $328 million thereafter.

As
a result of acquisitions that were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, deferred tax liabilities of $132 million were recorded in fiscal 2005 representing the difference
between the book value and the tax basis of acquired assets.

At
January 29, 2006, the Company had foreign net operating loss carry-forwards to reduce future taxable income of certain foreign subsidiaries of $5 million, which will expire at various
dates from 2009 to 2015. Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that these tax benefits related to the net operating losses will be realized and hence no valuation allowance has been
provided. The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes on $1.1 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries because of its intention to indefinitely reinvest
these earnings outside the U.S. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable; however, unrecognized
foreign income tax credits would be available to reduce a portion of this liability.

At
January 30, 2005, the Company had a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets totaling $23 million. During fiscal 2005, the Company reversed this valuation allowance of
$23 million because management concluded that it is more likely than not that these tax benefits will be realized. During fiscal 2004, the Company reversed a valuation allowance of
$31 million for deferred tax assets that were realized due to the Company's ability to fully utilize capital losses. The likelihood of realizing the benefit of deferred tax assets is assessed
on an ongoing basis. Consequently, future changes in the valuation allowance are possible.

The
Company's income tax returns are routinely under audit by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding its tax filing positions, including the timing and amount
of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In 2005, the IRS completed its examination of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns through fiscal 2002. As a result
of these examinations, certain deferred tax assets increased by $72 million. Certain issues relating to the examinations of fiscal years 2001 and 2002 are under appeal, the outcome of which is
not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

5.     EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS

The
Home Depot, Inc. 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan ("2005 Plan") and The Home Depot, Inc. 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan ("1997 Plan") (collectively the "Plans") provide that
incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, performance shares, performance units and deferred shares may be issued to selected
associates, officers and directors of the Company. Under the 2005 Plan, the maximum number of shares of the Company's common stock authorized for issuance is 255 million shares, with any award
other than a stock option reducing the number of shares available for issuance by 2.11 shares. As of January 29, 2006, there were 251 million shares available for future grant under the
2005 Plan. No additional equity awards may be issued from the 1997 Plan after the adoption of the 2005 Plan on May 26, 2005.


Under
the Plans, as of January 29, 2006, the Company had granted incentive and non-qualified stock options for 192 million shares, net of cancellations (of which
110 million had been exercised). Incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options are priced at the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of the grant and
typically vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing on the first anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary date of the grant. The Company recognized $133 million,
$86 million and $40 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to stock options granted, modified or settled and expense related to
the ESPP after the beginning of 2003 (see Note 1 under the caption "Stock-Based Compensation").

Under
the Plans, as of January 29, 2006, the Company had issued 6 million shares of restricted stock with a weighted average grant date value of $35.76 per share net of cancellations
(the restrictions on 741,000 shares have lapsed). Generally, the restrictions on the restricted stock lapse according to one of the following schedules: (1) the restrictions on 25% of the
restricted stock lapse upon the third and sixth year anniversaries of the date of issuance with the remaining 50% of the restricted stock lapsing
upon the associate's attainment of age 62, or (2) the restrictions on 100% of the restricted stock lapse at 3 or 5 years. The fair value of the restricted stock is expensed over the
period during which the restrictions lapse. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock of $32 million, $22 million and $13 million in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
Company maintains two employee stock purchase plans (U.S. and non-U.S. plans). The plan for U.S. associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. The ESPPs allow associates to purchase up to 152 million shares of common stock, of which 117 million shares
(adjusted for subsequent stock splits) have been purchased from inception of the plans. Prior to July 1, 2004, shares under the ESPPs were purchased at a price equal to the lower of 85% of the
stock's fair market value on the first day or the last day of the purchase period. Beginning July 1, 2004, the purchase price of shares under the ESPPs was equal to 85% of the stock's fair
market value on the last day of the purchase period. These shares were included in the pro forma calculation of stock-based compensation expense included in Note 1 under the caption
"Stock-Based Compensation." During fiscal 2005, 3 million shares were purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $33.72 per share. Under the outstanding ESPPs as of January 29,
2006, employees have contributed $10 million to purchase shares at 85% of the stock's fair market value on the last day (June 30, 2006) of the purchase period. The Company had
35 million shares available for issuance under the ESPPs at January 29, 2006.

As
of January 29, 2006, there were 3 million non-qualified stock options and 1 million deferred stock units outstanding under non-qualified stock option
and deferred stock unit plans that are not part of the Plans. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company did not grant any deferred stock units under the deferred stock unit plans that are not
part of the Plans. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, there were 461,000, 461,000 and 635,000 deferred stock units, respectively, granted under the Plans. The weighted average grant date value of the
outstanding deferred stock units at January 29, 2006 was $37.75 per share. Each deferred stock unit entitles the associate to one share of common stock to be received up to five years after the
vesting date of the deferred stock unit, subject to certain deferral rights of the associate. The fair value of the deferred stock units on the grant dates was $18 million, $16 million
and $19 million for deferred units granted in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts are being expensed over the vesting periods. The Company recorded stock-based compensation
expense related to deferred stock units of $10 million, $14 million and $13 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In
total, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense, including the expense of stock options, ESPPs, restricted stock and deferred stock units, of $175 million, $125 million
and $67 million, in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

6.     LEASES

The
Company leases certain retail locations, office space, warehouse and distribution space, equipment and vehicles. While most of the leases are operating leases, certain locations and equipment are
leased under capital leases. As leases expire, it can be expected that, in the normal course of business, certain leases will be renewed or replaced.

Certain
lease agreements include escalating rents over the lease terms. The Company expenses rent on a straight-line basis over life of the lease which commences on the date the Company
has the right to control the property. The cumulative expense recognized on a straight-line basis in excess of the cumulative payments is included in Other Accrued Expenses and Other
Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The
Company has a lease agreement under which the Company leases certain assets totaling $282 million. This lease was originally created under a structured financing arrangement and involves
two special purpose entities. The Company financed a portion of its new stores opened in fiscal years


through 2003 under this lease agreement. Under this agreement, the lessor purchased the properties, paid for the construction costs and subsequently leased the facilities to the Company. The
Company records the rental payments under the terms of the operating lease agreements as SG&A in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The
$282 million lease agreement expires in 2008 with no renewal option. The lease provides for a substantial residual value guarantee limited to 79% of the initial book value of the assets and
includes
a purchase option at the original cost of each property. As the leased assets were placed into service, the Company estimated its liability under the residual value guarantee. The maximum amount of
the residual value guarantee relative to the assets under the lease agreement described above is estimated to be $223 million. Events or circumstances that would require the Company to perform
under the residual value guarantee include (1) initial default on the lease with the assets sold for less than book value, or (2) the Company's decision not to purchase the assets at the
end of the lease and the sale of the assets results in proceeds less than the initial book value of the assets. During 2005, the Company committed to exercise its option to purchase the assets under
this lease for $282 million at the end of the lease term in 2008.

In
the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company adopted the revised version of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). FIN 46 requires
consolidation of a variable interest entity if a company's variable interest absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses or receives a majority of the entity's expected residual returns, or
both.

In
accordance with FIN 46, the Company was required to consolidate one of the two aforementioned special purpose entities that, before the effective date of FIN 46, met the requirements for
non-consolidation. The second special purpose entity that owns the assets leased by the Company totaling $282 million is not owned by or affiliated with the Company, its management
or its officers. Pursuant to FIN 46, the Company was not deemed to have a variable interest, and therefore was not required to consolidate this entity.

FIN
46 requires the Company to measure the assets and liabilities at their carrying amounts, which amounts would have been recorded if FIN 46 had been effective at the inception of the transaction.
Accordingly, during the first quarter of 2004, the Company recorded Long-Term Debt of $282 million and Long-Term Notes Receivable of $282 million on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company continues to record the rental payments under the operating lease agreements as SG&A in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The adoption of FIN 46 had no
economic impact on the Company.

Total
rent expense, net of minor sublease income for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $782 million, $684 million and $570 million, respectively. Certain store leases also provide
for contingent rent payments based on percentages of sales in excess of specified minimums. Contingent rent expense for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $9 million,
$11 million and $7 million, respectively. Real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and operating expenses applicable to the leased property are obligations of the Company under the
lease agreements.


The
approximate future minimum lease payments under capital and all other leases at January 29, 2006 were as follows (in millions):

Long-Term Debt, respectively. The assets under capital leases recorded in Property and Equipment, net of amortization, totaled $304 million and $283 million at
January 29, 2006 and January 30, 2005, respectively.

7.     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The
Company maintains active defined contribution retirement plans for its employees ("the Benefit Plans"). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the
Benefit Plans. The Company makes cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates' contributions as approved by the Board of Directors.

The
Company also maintains a restoration plan to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the
maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company funds the restoration plan through contributions made to a grantor trust, which are then used to purchase shares of the
Company's common stock in the open market.

The
Company's contributions to the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan were $132 million, $114 million and $106 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. At
January 29, 2006, the Benefit Plans and the restoration plan held a total of 31 million shares of the Company's common stock in trust for plan participants.

Diluted Earnings per Share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

9.     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

At
January 29, 2006, the Company was contingently liable for approximately $1.3 billion under outstanding letters of credit issued for certain business transactions, including insurance
programs, trade and construction contracts. The Company's letters of credit are primarily performance-based and are not based on changes in variable components, a liability or an equity security of
the other party.

The
Company is involved in litigation arising from the normal course of business. In management's opinion, this litigation is not expected to materially impact the Company's consolidated results of
operations or financial condition.

10.   ACQUISITIONS

The
following acquisitions completed by the Company were all accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Pro forma results of operations for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 would not be
materially different as a result of these acquisitions and therefore are not presented.

In
August 2005, the Company acquired National Waterworks, Inc., a leading distributor of products used to build, repair and maintain water and wastewater transmission systems. The
aggregate purchase price of this acquisition was $1.4 billion.

The
Company completed several other acquisitions during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, primarily adding professional service capabilities to Home Depot Supply. The total aggregate purchase price for
acquisitions, including National Waterworks, Inc., in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $2.6 billion, $729 million and $248 million, respectively. Accordingly, the Company
recorded Cost in Excess of the Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired related to the acquisitions of $1.9 billion, $554 million and $231 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

12.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On
March 24, 2006, the Company issued $1.0 billion of 5.20% Senior Notes due March 1, 2011 at a discount of $1 million and $3.0 billion of 5.40% Senior Notes due
March 1, 2016 at a discount of $15 million. Interest on these senior notes is due semi-annually on March 1 and September 1, of each year.

Additionally
in March 2006, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $2.0 billion accounted for as a cash flow hedge to hedge
interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the issuance of the 5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016. Upon issuance of the 5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016, the Company settled its
forward starting interest rate swap agreements and recorded a $19 million decrease to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the
5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016.
