PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

Copart, Inc. is a leading provider of salvage vehicle auction services in the United States.

We
provide vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance companies, with a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles through auctions, principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers,
rebuilders, repair licensees and used vehicle dealers. Salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an
insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made. We offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle auction process and minimize
administrative and processing costs. We generate revenues primarily from auction fees paid by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage.

We
have grown our salvage business through a combination of acquisitions and the development of new facilities and also by increasing our buyer base and implementing additional value-added services
for both buyers and suppliers. For fiscal year 2003, our revenues were approximately $347 million and our operating income was approximately $91 million. During the fiscal year ending
July 31, 2003, in addition to two public auction sites, we acquired one salvage vehicle auction facility and opened six new salvage vehicle auction facilities. Our acquisition was located in
Reno, Nevada. We opened new vehicle auction sites in Springfield, Missouri; Corpus Christi, Texas; Ft. Pierce, Florida; Rancho Cucamonga, California; Richmond, Virginia and Albany, New York. We
continue to evaluate acquisition candidates in both our salvage and public auction businesses.

We
believe that we offer the highest level of service in the salvage vehicle auction industry and have established our leading market position as follows:

•

by
providing national coverage that facilitates supplier access to buyers across the country, reduces towing and third-party storage expenses, offers a local presence for
vehicle inspection stations, and provides prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters by specially-trained teams;

•

by
providing a comprehensive range of customer services that include flexible vehicle payment programs, merchandising services, efficient title processing, timely
pick-up and delivery of vehicles and Internet auctions;

•

by
establishing and efficiently integrating new facilities and acquisitions; and

•

by
applying technology to enhance operating efficiency through Internet bidding, web-based order processing, salvage value quotes, electronic communication with
buyers and sellers, vehicle imaging and an electronic used vehicle parts locator service.


In
recent periods, we have expanded our business beyond salvage vehicle auction services and have entered the market for public auctioning of used vehicles. We auction vehicles directly to the public
and automobile dealers on behalf of banks, leasing or financing companies, automobile dealers, repossession companies and for our own account. To date, we own six public automobile auction facilities
located in Detroit, Michigan; Chesapeake, Virginia; New Castle, Delaware; Greencastle, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Richmond, Virginia. In April 2001, we announced the creation of
Motors Auction Group, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary through which we operate our public automobile auction business. To date, revenues from our public auction business have not been
material relative to the revenues from our salvage business. We expect to acquire additional public auction facilities in the future as we continue to focus resources on this aspect of our business.

We
were organized as a California corporation in 1982 and became a public company in 1994. Our principal executive offices are located at 4665 Business Center Drive, Fairfield, California 94534, and
our telephone number at that address is (707) 639-5000.

Industry Overview

The salvage vehicle auction industry provides an outlet for salvage vehicle suppliers to liquidate total loss vehicles. Salvage vehicle auction companies generally auction
salvage vehicles on consignment for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price. On occasion, salvage auction companies may purchase vehicles from vehicle suppliers at a formula-based price, based
on a percentage of the vehicles' estimated pre-loss value ("actual cash value") and auction the vehicles for their own account. Salvage vehicle auction companies typically operate from one
or more salvage facilities where vehicles are processed, stored and auctioned.

Although
there are other suppliers of salvage vehicles, such as financial institutions, vehicle leasing companies, automobile rental companies and automobile dealers, the primary source of salvage
vehicles is insurance companies.

Over
the last several years, automobile manufacturers have begun incorporating certain standard features that increase passenger safety, including unibody construction, passenger safety cages with
surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts, plastic components, airbags and computer systems. We believe that one effect of these features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more likely
to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes, resulting in an increasing supply of total loss salvage vehicles in the future.

The
primary buyers of salvage vehicles are vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees and used vehicle dealers. Vehicle dismantlers, which we believe are the largest group of salvage vehicle
buyers, either dismantle a vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders, used vehicle dealers or the public. Vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally
purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell. Used vehicle dealers purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale.

Following
an accident involving an insured vehicle, the damaged vehicle is generally towed to a towing company or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination.
The vehicle is inspected by the insurance company's adjuster, who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle's mileage, options and condition in
order to estimate its actual cash value. The adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster's estimate of repair costs and the
vehicle's salvage value, as well as customer service considerations. If the cost of repair is greater than the actual cash value less the estimated salvage value, the insurance company generally will
classify the vehicle as a total loss. The insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a salvage vehicle auction company, settle with the insured vehicle owner and receive title to the
vehicle.

In
disposing of a salvage vehicle, a vehicle supplier typically assigns the vehicle to a salvage vehicle auction company. The primary factors that vehicle suppliers consider when selecting a salvage
vehicle auction company include:

•

the
anticipated percentage return on salvage (i.e., gross salvage proceeds, minus vehicle handling and selling expenses, divided by the actual cash value); and

•

the
services provided by the salvage vehicle auction company and the degree to which such services reduce administrative costs and expenses.


Upon
receipt of the pick up order, a vehicle transport company arranges for the transport of a vehicle to a vehicle auction facility. As a service to the vehicle supplier, the salvage vehicle auction
company will customarily pay advance charges (reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle suppliers) to obtain the subject vehicle's release from a towing company or vehicle repair facility.
Typically, advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle supplier are recovered upon sale of the salvage vehicle.

The
vehicle then remains in storage until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state's motor vehicle
regulatory agency ("DMV"). Total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage certificate from the DMV. Upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the DMV, which is
generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pick-up, the vehicle is auctioned. Vehicles are sold primarily through weekly or biweekly auctions.

Operating and Growth Strategy

Our growth strategy is to increase our revenues and profitability by, among other things, (i) acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle auction facilities in key
markets, (ii) pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements, (iii) expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers and (iv) developing and expanding public
automobile auction facilities. In addition, we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to affect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing
our operational procedures, integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel when necessary.

As
part of our overall expansion strategy, our objective is to increase our revenues, operating profits and market share in the vehicle auction industry. To implement our growth strategy, we intend to
continue to do the following:

Acquire and Develop New Salvage Vehicle Auction Facilities in Key Markets

Our strategy is to offer integrated services to vehicle suppliers on a national or regional basis by acquiring or developing salvage facilities in new and existing markets. We
integrate our new acquisitions into our national network and capitalize on certain operating efficiencies resulting from, among other things, the reduction of duplicative overhead and the
implementation of our operating procedures.

Pursue National and Regional Vehicle Supply Agreements

Our broad national presence enhances our ability to enter into local, regional or national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers. We actively seek to establish national and
regional supply agreements with insurance companies by promoting our ability to achieve high net returns and broader access to buyers through our national coverage and electronic commerce
capabilities. By utilizing our existing insurance company supplier relationships, we are able to build new supplier relationships and pursue additional supply agreements in existing and new markets.

Expand Our Service Offerings to Suppliers and Buyers

Over the past several years, we have expanded our available service offerings to vehicle suppliers and buyers. The primary focus of these new service offerings is to maximize
returns to our suppliers and maximize product value to our buyers. Recent service enhancements include, for our suppliers, real-time access to sales data over the Internet and, for our
buyers, the ability to bid on vehicles via the Internet in real-time. We plan to continue to refine and expand our services, including offering software that can assist our suppliers in
expediting claims and salvage management tools that help suppliers integrate their systems with ours.


Develop and Expand Public Automobile Auction Facilities

The
public automobile auction industry is highly fragmented, consisting primarily of small local operations, and we believe that it currently presents opportunities for consolidation. To expand our
geographic reach, we plan to acquire or develop new public automobile auction facilities as favorable opportunities arise. Our public automobile auctions allow the general public to bid via the
Internet or at live auctions on a wide range of end-of-lease vehicles, repossessed vehicles, dealer trade-ins and vehicles that we offer for sale on a consignment
basis. We have established the systems, infrastructure, and management required to begin expanding our public automobile auction business. To date, we have acquired six facilities and launched our
public automobile auction website. We believe that our combination of experience and expertise, along with our established reputation for acquiring and integrating salvage vehicle auction operations,
gives us the relevant experience to pursue future acquisitions and development of public automobile auction facilities.

Our Competitive Advantages

We
believe that the following attributes and the services that we offer position us to take advantage of many opportunities in the salvage vehicle auction industry.

National Coverage and Ability to Respond on a National Scale

Since
our inception in 1982, we have expanded from a single facility in Vallejo, California to an integrated network of 102 facilities located in 40 states as of July 31, 2003. We are able to
offer integrated services on a national basis to our vehicle suppliers, which allows us to respond to the needs of our suppliers and buyers with maximum efficiency. Our national coverage provides our
suppliers with key advantages, including:

•

a
reduction in administrative time and effort;

•

a
reduction in overall vehicle towing costs;

•

convenient
local facilities;

•

improved
access to buyers throughout the country; and

•

a
prompt response in the event of a natural disaster or other catastrophe.

Value-Added Services

We
believe that we offer the most comprehensive range of services in our industry, including:

•

the
operation of a fleet of over 650 trucks which enables us to pick up most of our suppliers' vehicles within 24 hours, reducing overall costs to our suppliers;

•

Internet
bidding, Internet proxy bidding and virtual auctions, which enhance the competitive bidding process;

•

e-mail
notifications to potential buyers of salvage vehicles that match desired characteristics;

•

sophisticated
vehicle processing at auction sites, including five-view digital imaging of each vehicle and the scanning of each vehicle's title and other
significant documents such as body shop invoices, all of which are available from us through the Internet;

•

CoPartfinder,
our Internet-based used vehicle parts locator that provides vehicle dismantlers with greater resale opportunities for their salvage purchases; and

•

Offsite
sales allow vehicle suppliers to auction any vehicle, boat, or heavy equipment from where it sits. Like other popular Internet auctions for consumers, the seller
controls the process.

Proven Ability to Acquire and Integrate Acquisitions

We
have a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating salvage vehicle auction facilities. Since becoming a public company in 1994, we have completed the acquisition of 55 salvage
vehicle auction facilities. As part of our acquisition and integration strategy, we seek to:

•

strengthen
our national network and access new markets;


•

utilize
our existing corporate and technology infrastructure over a larger base of operations; and

•

introduce
our comprehensive services and operational expertise.

We
strive to integrate all new facilities into our existing network without disruption of service to vehicle suppliers. We work with new suppliers to implement our fee structures and new service
programs. We typically retain existing employees at acquired facilities in order to gain knowledge about, and respond to, the local market. We also assign a special integration team to help convert
newly acquired facilities to our own management information and proprietary software systems, enabling us to ensure a smooth and consistent transition to our business operating and auction systems.

Technology to Enhance and Expand Our Business

We
have developed management information and proprietary software systems that allow us to deliver a fully integrated service offering. Our proprietary software programs provide vehicle suppliers with
online access to data and reports regarding their salvage vehicles being processed at any of our facilities. This technology allows vehicle suppliers to monitor each stage of our salvage vehicle
auction process, from pick up to auction and settlement by the buyer. Our full range of Internet services allows us to expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle auction process and minimizes the
administrative and processing costs for us as well as our suppliers. We believe that our integrated technology systems generate improved capacity and financial returns for our clients, resulting in
high client retention, and allow us to expand our national supply contracts.

Our Service Offerings

We
offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services, which expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle auction process, maximize proceeds and minimize costs.

Online Supplier Access

Through
Copart Access, our Internet-based service for vehicle suppliers, we enable suppliers to assign vehicles for auction, check auction calendars, view vehicle images and history, view and reprint
body shop invoices and towing receipts and view the historical performance of the vehicles sold at our auctions.

Salvage Estimation Services

We
offer Copart ProQuote, a proprietary service that assists suppliers in the vehicle claims evaluation process by providing online salvage value estimates, which helps suppliers determine whether to
repair a particular vehicle or deem it a total loss.

Transportation Services

We
operate a fleet of over 650 trucks, which enables us to pick up most of our suppliers' vehicles within 24 hours. To supplement our own fleet of trucks, we also maintain contracts with
third-party vehicle transport companies for our facilities. Our national network and transportation capabilities provide cost and time savings to our vehicle suppliers and ensures on-time
vehicle pick up and prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters.

Vehicle Inspection Stations

We
offer certain of our major insurance company suppliers office and yard space to house vehicle inspection stations on-site at our auction facilities. We have over 30 vehicle inspection
stations at our facilities nationwide. An on-site vehicle inspection station provides our insurance company suppliers with a central location to inspect potential total loss vehicles,
which reduces storage charges that otherwise may be incurred at the initial storage or repair facility.

On-Demand Reporting

We
provide vehicle suppliers with on-demand reports online, via fax or e-mail that summarize data on salvage vehicles that we process for the particular supplier. These reports
track our vehicle suppliers' gross and net returns on each


vehicle,
service charges, and other data that enable our vehicle suppliers to more easily administer and monitor the salvage vehicle disposition process.

DMV Processing

We
have extensive expertise in DMV document and title processing for salvage vehicles. We have developed a computer system, which provides a direct link to the DMV computer systems of several states.
This allows us to expedite the processing of vehicle title paperwork. By facilitating the title acquisition from the insured vehicle owner, we effectively shorten the time period between the auction
of salvage vehicles and when our vehicle suppliers receive the proceeds from their sales.

Flexible Vehicle Processing Programs

At
the election of the vehicle supplier, we auction vehicles pursuant to our Percentage Incentive Program consignment basis or on a fixed fee consignment basis.

Percentage Fee Consignment.

Our Percentage Incentive Program ("PIP") is an innovative processing program designed to broadly serve the
needs of vehicle suppliers. Under PIP, we agree to sell at auction all of the salvage vehicles of a vehicle supplier in a specified market for a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price.
Because our revenues under PIP are directly linked to the vehicle's auction price, we have an incentive to actively merchandise those
vehicles to maximize the net return on salvage vehicles. We provide the vehicle supplier, at our expense, with transport of the vehicle to our nearest facility, storage for up to 90 days and
DMV document and title processing. In addition, we provide merchandising services such as covering or taping openings to protect vehicle interiors from weather, washing vehicle exteriors, vacuuming
vehicle interiors, cleaning and polishing dashboards and tires, making keys for driveable vehicles and operating "drive-through" sales auctions of driveable vehicles. We believe our merchandising
efforts increase the sales prices of salvage vehicles, thereby increasing the return on salvage vehicles to both vehicle suppliers and us. In fiscal year 2003, we processed approximately 67% of all
our salvage vehicles under PIP.

Fixed Fee Consignment.

Under our fixed fee consignment program, we sell vehicles for a fixed consignment fee, generally $50 to $175 per
vehicle. Although sometimes included in the consignment fee, we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility, storage of the vehicle, and other incidental
costs. Approximately 33% of all salvage vehicles we processed in fiscal year 2003 were processed under the fixed fee consignment program.

Buyer Network

We maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling, rebuilding, repair and resale businesses. Our database includes each
buyer's vehicle preference and purchasing history. This data enables us to notify via e-mail prospective buyers throughout the region or country of salvage vehicles available for bidding
that match their vehicle preferences. Listings of salvage vehicles to be auctioned on a particular day and location are also made available on the Internet.

Auction Process

We offer a flexible and unique auction process designed to maximize the sale prices of the vehicles that we auction. Our live auction process is enhanced by our systems, which
permit live Internet bidding from registered buyers to be incorporated into the regular auction process. In addition, prospective buyers are allowed to remotely participate in the auction process by
submitting silent bids online up to 14 days prior to the actual live auction. The combined use of the Internet bids and live bids helps to ensure that we receive the highest possible price for
each vehicle sold.

We
have also developed other unique systems, which we have implemented at some of our facilities. For example, Virtual Bidding and Virtual Bidding Second Generation ("VB


") are Internet
bidding products that allow buyers to bid real-time against other real-time bidders over the Internet at copart.com. With Virtual Bidding, buyers can follow auctions on the
Internet as if they were there and bid based on the current market price. Once the auction is closed, buyers know whether or not they own the car. With Virtual Bidding Second Generation buyers bid
real-time exclusively


against
other Internet bidders at copart.com. These products open the Copart auction process to registered buyers anywhere in the world who have Internet access.

CoPartfinder

CoPartfinder is our unique Internet "search engine" that enables users to locate used vehicle parts quickly and efficiently. CoPartfinder is accessible by the public through a
Copart-sponsored website. CoPartfinder lists vehicles recently sold at our auctions and identifies the purchasers. This allows vehicle dismantlers and other resellers to streamline their parts sale
process and access a large pool of potential buyers. We charge a nominal per-search fee to potential parts buyers, who can use CoPartfinder to search for specific vehicle makes and models
and view digital images of vehicles that meet their requirements. Once a specific parts supplier is identified for a specific part requirement, buyers have the option to call, fax, e-mail
or instantly message the dismantler/supplier for additional information. We believe that CoPartfinder provides an incentive for vehicle dismantlers to purchase their salvage vehicles through our
auction process.

Supply Arrangements and Supplier Marketing

We obtain salvage vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle suppliers. In fiscal year 2003, vehicles supplied by State Farm Insurance Company accounted for approximately 13%
of our revenues. No other supplier accounted for more than 8% of our revenues. Of the total number of vehicles that we processed in fiscal year 2003, we obtained approximately 85% from insurance
company suppliers. Our arrangements with our suppliers are either written or oral agreements that are typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice.

We
typically contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other vehicle suppliers. The agreements are customized to each vehicle supplier's particular needs and often provide
for the disposition of different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods. Our contracts or arrangements generally provide that we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by
the vehicle supplier in a designated geographic area.

We
market our services to vehicle suppliers through an in-house sales force that utilizes a variety of sales techniques, including targeted mailing of our sales literature, telemarketing,
follow-up personal sales calls, and participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions. Based upon our historical data on salvage vehicles and vehicle information
supplied by vehicle suppliers, our marketing personnel will provide
vehicle suppliers with detailed analysis of the net return on salvage vehicles and a proposal setting forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns on salvage vehicles and reduce
administrative costs and expenses.

Buyers

We maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling, rebuilding, repair and resale businesses. We believe that we have
established a broad buyer base by providing buyers of salvage vehicles with a variety of programs and services. To gain admission to one of our auctions and become a registered buyer, prospective
buyers must first pay an initial registration fee and an annual fee, provide requested personal and business information and have, in most states, a vehicle dismantler's, dealer's, resale or repair
license. Registration entitles a buyer to transact business at any of our auctions subject to local licensing and permitting requirements. A buyer may also bring guests to an auction for a fee. Strict
admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that would invalidate an auction. We market to buyers on the Internet and via e-mail notifications, sales notices, telemarketing
and participation in trade show events. In addition, we have initiated programs specifically designed to address the needs of our wholesale and high volume buyers, including providing streamlined
paperwork processing, simplified payment procedures and personalized customer services.

Competition

We face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles. We believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction companies
and vehicle dismantlers. These national, regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle suppliers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than
ours. The largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers include the ADESA Corporation, Auction Broadcasting Company, Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc., Manheim Auctions and SADISCO. The largest
national dismantlers include Greenleaf and LKQ Corporation. These national dismantlers, in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as


the
American Recycling Association and the United Recyclers Group, purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies, thereby bypassing auction companies entirely, including us.

Management Information Systems

Our primary management information system consists of an expandable, integrated IBM AS/400 mainframe computer system, integrated computer interfaces and proprietary business
operating software that we developed and which tracks salvage and public auction vehicles throughout the auction process. We call this proprietary business operating software the Copart Auction System
("CAS") and have implemented CAS at all of our salvage auction facilities. For the public auction business we call this proprietary business operating software Motors Auction Exchange ("MAX"). In
addition, we have integrated our mainframe computer system with Internet and Intranet systems in order to provide secure access to CAS and MAX data and images in a variety of formats. We also host our
own Intranet and Internet platforms.

Employees

As of July 31, 2003, we had approximately 2,776 full-time employees, of whom approximately 219 were engaged in general and administrative functions and
approximately 2,557 were engaged in yard and fleet operations. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements; however, driver and yard employees at our Detroit, Michigan salvage auction
facility have voted to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ("Teamsters"). The driver election was held during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 and the yard employee election was held
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The Teamsters also petitioned the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB"), seeking to be certified as representatives of all office and clerical employees at
our Detroit salvage auction facility. An election to determine whether or not the Teamsters will represent the office employees of the Detroit salvage auction facility was conducted during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003; however, the outcome of this election was undetermined as of October 16, 2003. Lastly, during the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we were served with a petition filed with
the NLRB whereby the Teamsters are seeking to be certified as the representatives of all full-time truck drivers at our Waldorf, Maryland salvage auction facility. A vote by the Waldorf,
Maryland truck drivers on whether or not to be represented by the Teamsters is scheduled for October 24, 2003. We are currently engaged in collective bargaining with the Teamsters who are
representing the driver and yard employees at our Detroit, Michigan salvage auction facility.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment. In the salvage vehicle auction industry, large numbers of wrecked
vehicles are stored at auction facilities and, during that time, spills of fuel, motor oils and other fluids may occur, resulting in soil, surface water or groundwater contamination. Certain of our
facilities store petroleum products and other hazardous materials in above-ground containment tanks and some of our facilities generate waste materials such as solvents or used oils that must be
disposed of as non-hazardous or hazardous waste, as appropriate. We have implemented procedures to reduce the amount of soil contamination that may occur at our facilities, and we have
initiated safety programs and training of personnel on the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable
environmental regulations and we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to remain in environmental compliance.

In
connection with the acquisition of our Dallas, Texas facility in 1994, we set aside $3.0 million to cover the costs of environmental remediation, stabilization and related consulting
expenses for a six-acre portion of the facility that contained elevated levels of lead due to the activities of the former operators. We began the stabilization process in 1996 and
completed it in 1999. We paid all remediation and related costs from the $3.0 million fund and, in accordance with the acquisition agreement, distributed the remainder of the fund to the seller
of the Dallas facility, less $200,000 which was held back to cover the costs of obtaining the no-further-action letter. In September 2002, our environmental engineering consultant
issued a report which concludes that the soil stabilization has effectively stabilized the lead-impacted soil, and that the concrete cap should prevent impact to storm water and subsequent
surface water impact. Our consultant thereafter submitted an Operations and Maintenance Plan ("Plan") to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ") providing for a two-year
inspection and maintenance plan for the concrete cap, and a two-year ground and surface water monitoring plan. In January of 2003, the TCEQ approved the Plan, subject to the additions of
upstream (background) surface water samples from the intermittent stream adjacent


to
the facility and documentation of any repairs to the concrete cap during the post closure monitoring period. As of September 2003, we have completed one of the scheduled monitoring tests,
which reflects that the lead-impacted, stabilized soil is not impacting the ground and/or surface water. If the tests conducted for the remainder of the two-year monitoring
period provided for in the Plan demonstrate that the lead-impacted, stabilized soil is not impacting the ground and/or surface water, a no-further-action letter will be
requested at that time. We are not assured of receiving the no-further-action letter and we may incur further liabilities if the stabilization process proves ineffective. In addition, in
1994, we detected a small quantity of two hazardous substances in a temporary groundwater monitoring well at the Dallas facility. Our environmental consultants concluded that both substances arose
from an off-site source and no further action was recommended.

We
do not believe that any of the above environmental matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Governmental Regulations

Our operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations. The acquisition and sale of
damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by state motor vehicle departments. In addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles, we are also subject to various local zoning
requirements with regard to the location of our auction and storage facilities. These zoning requirements vary from location to location. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects
with applicable regulatory requirements. We may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal, state, and local governmental agencies in new markets.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business, such as actions related to injuries, property damage or handling or disposal of
vehicles. Among this litigation is a lawsuit filed in Massachusetts against us which purports to be a class action on behalf of persons whose vehicles were disposed of by us as abandoned vehicles,
which the claimant contends were disposed of without complying with State laws. Lawsuits filed in California against us and rental car company vehicle suppliers, which purported to be class actions on
behalf of California residents who owned previously damaged rental car vehicles that were sold through our auctions on clean titles, have been dismissed without prejudice, and the individual claims
have been settled and we have received, or anticipate receipt of, dismissals with prejudice of all individual claims. On June 13, 2003 we received notice from the United States Department of
Labor ("DOL") that Wayne R. Hilty, our former Chief Financial Officer, had filed a complaint with the DOL alleging that Copart had terminated his employment in violation of
Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. By the end of June 2003, Copart had settled the dispute with Mr. Hilty, the DOL complaint filed by Mr. Hilty against us was
withdrawn, and the DOL advised us that it had closed its file on this matter. We are also involved in various governmental and administrative proceedings primarily relating to licensing and operation
of our business. We provide for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future results of
operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations, the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not feasible to determine the
outcome of these matters, management believes that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.


FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

We depend on a limited number of major suppliers of salvage vehicles. The loss of one or more of these major suppliers could adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition, and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates.

Historically, a limited number of vehicle suppliers have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues. In fiscal 2003, vehicles supplied by our two largest suppliers
accounted for approximately 13% and 8% of our revenues, respectively. Supplier arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to
90 days notice. Vehicle suppliers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets, which has affected the pricing for auction services in those markets. There can be no
assurance that our existing agreements will not be cancelled. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle suppliers or that we will be able
to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles. A reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle supplier or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a substantial vehicle
supplier could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings
and revenue growth rates.

Factors such as mild weather conditions in the United States can have an adverse affect on our revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates.

Mild weather conditions in the United States tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles
are damaged as a result of mild weather-related conditions. Accordingly, mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories, which would be expected to have an adverse effect
on our revenue and earnings and related growth rates and could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Conversely, our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter
or as a result of adverse weather-related conditions such as flooding. During periods of mild weather conditions, our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related
growth will be increasingly dependent on our
ability to obtain additional vehicle suppliers and to compete more effectively in the market, each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections.

The salvage vehicle auction industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully.

We face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles. We believe our principal competitors include other vehicle auction
companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other suppliers, and large vehicle dismantlers, who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance
companies, bypassing the salvage auction process. Many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive auction companies and large dismantlers. Many of our competitors may
have greater financial resources than us. Due to the limited number of vehicle suppliers, the absence of long-term contractual commitments between us and our suppliers and the increasingly
competitive market environment, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense.

We
may also encounter significant competition for local, regional and national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers. There can be no assurance that the existence of other local, regional or
national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans. Furthermore, we are likely to face competition from major competitors
in the acquisition of salvage vehicle auction facilities, which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations. These potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses, organized salvage vehicle buying groups, automobile
manufacturers, automobile auctioneers and software companies. While most vehicle suppliers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such
as us, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue, which could adversely affect our market share, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, existing or new competitors
may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us; therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.


Because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new salvage vehicle auction facilities, the rate of growth of our business and
revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and development of new facilities.

We seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of other salvage vehicle auction facilities and the development of new salvage vehicle auction
facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to:

•

continue
to acquire additional facilities on favorable terms;

•

increase
revenues and profitability at acquired and new facilities;

•

maintain
the historical revenue and earnings growth rates we have been able to obtain through facility openings and strategic acquisitions; or

•

create
new salvage vehicle auction facilities that meet the Company's current revenue and profitability requirements.

As we continue to expand our operations, our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to manage growth is not only dependent on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities, but also on our ability to:

•

hire,
train and manage additional qualified personnel;

•

establish
new relationships or expand existing relationships with vehicle suppliers;

•

identify
and acquire or lease suitable premises on competitive terms;

•

secure
adequate capital;

•

maintain
the supply of vehicles from vehicle suppliers; and

•

compete
successfully in the public automobile auction sector.

Our
inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We have limited experience in the public automobile auction business and may not be successful in our efforts to compete in this market, which may adversely affect our current
growth strategy.

We have historically focused on the operation, acquisition and development of salvage vehicle auction facilities and only have limited experience in operating public automobile
auction facilities. The public automobile auction market differs from the salvage vehicle auction market in that used vehicles in general working order are sold to the public. We intend to expand our
public automobile auction facilities through the acquisition of public auction sites and cannot know whether our existing salvage auction business model will translate successfully into the public
automobile auction market. To the extent that we cannot successfully compete in the public automobile auction market, our growth strategy could be harmed.

Our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate, causing the price of our stock to decline.

Our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a
number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

fluctuations
in the market value of salvage and used vehicles;

•

the
availability of salvage vehicles;

•

variations
in vehicle accident rates;

•

buyer
attendance at salvage vehicle auctions;

•

delays
or changes in state title processing;


•

changes
in state or federal laws or regulations affecting salvage vehicles;

•

our
ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully;

•

the
timing and size of our new facility openings;

•

the
announcement of new vehicle supply agreements by us or our competitors;

•

severity
of weather and seasonality of weather patterns;

•

the
amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;

•

the
availability and cost of general business insurance;

•

labor
costs and collective bargaining; and

•

availability
of subhaulers at competitive rates.

In
addition, as we increasingly rely on Internet-based auctions, we have become more dependent on our information technology systems. If our systems fail or otherwise prove unreliable or if we
experience system problems that we cannot readily remedy, it could result in increased expenditures for information technology systems and maintenance and could impair our relations with
Internet-auction buyers.

Due
to the foregoing factors, our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our
results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance. In the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being
below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.

Government regulation of the salvage vehicle auction industry may impair our operations, increase our costs of doing business and create potential liability.

Participants in the salvage vehicle auction industry are subject to, and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of U.S. or Canadian, federal,
state, provincial and local governmental, regulatory and administrative rules, regulations, licensure requirements and procedures, including those governing vehicle registration, the environment,
zoning and land use. Failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of
penalties and other liabilities. In addition, new regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities, may limit our base of salvage
vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles.

The operation of our auction facilities poses certain environmental risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment. In the salvage vehicle auction industry,
large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at auction facilities and, during that time, spills of fuel, motor oil and other fluids may occur, resulting in soil, surface water or groundwater
contamination. Environmental issues resulting from fuel spills, oil spillage, or similar problems are also present at our public auction facilities. In addition, certain of our facilities generate
and/or store petroleum products and other hazardous materials, including waste solvents and used oil. We could incur substantial expenditures for preventative, investigative or remedial action and
could be exposed to liability arising from our operations, contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities, or the disposal of our waste at off-site locations.
Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future. Although we
have obtained indemnification for pre-existing environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities, there can be no assurance that such
indemnifications will be adequate. Any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.


If we experience problems with our trucking fleet operations, our business could be harmed.

We use a fleet of trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our auction facilities. We are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services, including
inclement weather, disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, labor matters (including from time to time efforts to establish collective bargaining arrangements), availability and price of fuel
and other liabilities arising from the operation of a fleet, including accident and injury claims. In addition, our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm
our reputation and brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other shareholders.

Our executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 26% of our common stock as of July 31, 2003. If they were to act
together, these shareholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by shareholders, including the election of directors, any amendments to our articles of incorporation
and certain significant corporate transactions, including potential merger or acquisition transactions. In addition, without the consent of these shareholders, we could be delayed or prevented from
entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors. These shareholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors.

We recently adopted a shareholder rights plan, or poison pill, which could affect the price of our common stock and make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to purchase
a large portion of our securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest, or to acquire us.

In March 2003, our Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill. The poison pill may discourage, delay, or prevent a third party
from acquiring a large portion of our securities, initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, or acquiring us through an acquisition, merger, or similar transaction. Such an acquirer could be
prevented from consummating one of these transactions even if our shareholders might receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices.

If we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our
objectives.

Our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team, all of whom are employed on an at-will basis and none
of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete. If we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, in particular Willis J. Johnson, our Chief Executive
Officer, and A. Jayson Adair, our President, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able to successfully
manage our business or achieve our business objectives.


ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters are located in Fairfield, California. This facility consists of approximately 100,000 square feet of office space owned by Copart. We
also own or lease an additional 104 facilities in the United States and Canada consisting of an aggregate of approximately 3,040 acres located in California, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma,
Kansas, Washington, Oregon, Georgia, Missouri, New York, Connecticut, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maryland, Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Mississippi, North Carolina,
Indiana, Arizona, Louisiana, Utah, Nevada, Alabama, South Carolina, Iowa, Michigan, Tennessee, Virginia, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Kentucky, Delaware, Maine, West Virginia and Ontario. We believe
that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations and
additional offices.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business, such as actions related to injuries, property damage or handling or
disposal of vehicles. Among this litigation is a lawsuit filed in Massachusetts against us which purports to be a class action on behalf of persons whose vehicles were disposed of by us as abandoned
vehicles, which the claimant contends were disposed of without complying with State laws. Lawsuits filed in California against us and rental car company vehicle suppliers, which purported to be class
actions on behalf of California residents who owned previously damaged rental car vehicles that were sold through our auctions on clean titles, have been dismissed without prejudice, and the
individual claims have been settled and we have received, or anticipate receipt of, dismissals with prejudice of all individual claims. On June 13, 2003 we received notice from the United
States Department of Labor ("DOL") that Wayne R. Hilty, our former Chief Financial Officer, had filed a complaint with the DOL alleging that Copart had terminated his employment in
violation of Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. By the end of June 2003, Copart had settled the dispute with Mr. Hilty, the DOL complaint filed by Mr. Hilty
against us was withdrawn, and the DOL advised us that it had closed its file on this matter. We are also involved in various governmental and administrative proceedings primarily relating to licensing
and operation of our business. We provide for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our
future results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations, the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not feasible to
determine the outcome of these matters, management believes that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

We did not submit any matters to a vote of our shareholders during the fourth quarter of our 2003 fiscal year.

Overview

We process salvage vehicles principally on a consignment method, on either the Percentage Incentive Program ("PIP") or on a fixed fee consignment basis. Using either
consignment method, only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue.

For
the fiscal years ended July 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, approximately 67%, 67% and 62% of the vehicles we sold, respectively, were processed under PIP. We attempt to convert vehicle supplier
agreements at acquired operations to PIP, which typically results in higher net returns to vehicle suppliers and higher fees to us than standard fixed fee consignment programs.

For
the fiscal years ended July 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, approximately 33%, 33% and 38% of the vehicles we sold, respectively, were processed under fixed fee agreements.

Due
to a number of factors, including the timing and size of new acquisitions, market conditions, and acceptance of PIP by vehicle suppliers, the percentage of vehicles processed under these programs
in future periods may vary.

Our
revenues consist of salvage fees charged to vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers, transportation revenue and purchased vehicle revenues. Salvage fees from vehicle suppliers include fees under PIP
agreements and fixed fee programs where we charge for title processing, special preparation, storage and auctioning. Salvage fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles,
storage and annual registration. Transportation revenue includes charges to suppliers for towing vehicles under fixed fee contracts. Transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to
buyers for delivering vehicles. Purchased vehicle revenues are comprised of the price that buyers paid at our auctions for vehicles processed that we own.

Costs
attributable to yard and fleet expenses consist primarily of operating personnel (which includes yard management, clerical and yard employees), rent, contract vehicle towing, insurance, fuel,
fleet maintenance and repair, and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts. Costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive, accounting and data
processing, sales personnel, professional fees and marketing expenses.

The
period-to-period comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions and new openings made by us during such
periods.

Acquisitions and New Operations

We have experienced significant growth as we have acquired twelve vehicle auction facilities and established fifteen new facilities since the beginning of fiscal 2001. All of
these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.


As
part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated service to vehicle suppliers, we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions, as well as the regions currently served
by our facilities. As part of this strategy, in fiscal 2003, we acquired new facilities in or near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Reno, Nevada and Richmond, Virginia and opened new facilities in or near
Springfield, Missouri; Corpus Christi, Texas; Ft. Pierce, Florida; Rancho Cucamonga, California; Richmond, Virginia and Albany, New York. In fiscal 2002, we acquired new facilities in or near New
Castle, Delaware; Savannah, Georgia; Tifton, Georgia; Charleston, West Virginia; Haslet, Texas and Greencastle, Pennsylvania and opened new facilities in or near Lyman, Maine; Tucson, Arizona;
Somerville, New Jersey and Amarillo, Texas. In fiscal 2001, we acquired facilities in or near Chatham, Virginia; Shreveport, Louisiana and Mount Morris, Pennsylvania and opened new facilities in or
near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Chicago Heights, Illinois; Martinez, California; Lawrenceburg, Kentucky and New Orleans, Louisiana. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company
acquired a facility in Eugene, Oregon and opened a facility in Toronto, Canada. We believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage.

We
seek to increase revenues and profitability by, among other things, (i) acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle auction facilities in key markets, (ii) pursuing national and
regional vehicle supply agreements, (iii) expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers and (iv) developing and expanding public automobile auction facilities. In addition, we
implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures, integrating our
management information systems and redeploying personnel, when necessary.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to vehicle pooling costs, allowance for doubtful accounts,
goodwill, income taxes and long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.

We
believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

We
defer, in vehicle pooling costs, certain yard and fleet expenses of vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date. We quantify the deferred costs using a
calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period, the number of vehicles sold during the period and certain yard and fleet expenses of the
period. The primary expenses capitalized are labor, transportation, and vehicle processing. If our allocation factors change then yard and fleet expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in
the future.

We
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to suppliers or buyers and the inability of our suppliers or buyers to
make required payments. If billing disputes exceed expectations and/or if the financial condition of our suppliers or buyers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required.

We
evaluate the impairment of goodwill annually at a facility level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. Under this accounting policy we have not recognized any
charges for the impairment of goodwill. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of a facility could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the
investment that may not be reflected in an investment's current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.

We
evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. Generally accepted accounting principles require the assessment of the Company's performance and other relevant factors
when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets. The Company's ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate future
taxable income. Based on our historical operating earnings, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded and, accordingly, have not


established
a valuation allowance. Additional timing differences future earnings trends and/or tax strategies may occur which could warrant a need for a valuation allowance or a reserve.

We
are also required to estimate income tax provisions and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions. Such estimates involve significant interpretations of regulations and
are inherently very complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year.

We
evaluate long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows change in the future, we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset in the future.

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002

Revenues were approximately $347.4 million during fiscal 2003, an increase of approximately $31.0 million, or 10%, over fiscal 2002. The increase was due
primarily to increased volume at existing facilities, which contributed approximately $24.1 million in revenue and to new facilities (identified below), which contributed approximately
$6.9 million of new revenue. Our revenue growth rate in the current fiscal year decreased from 25% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 to 10% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. The decrease in
revenue growth is due primarily to slower growth in units sold. Given our relatively high historic growth rates we may not be able to maintain these growth rates in future years.

New
facilities in or near West Mifflin, Pennsylvania; Reno, Nevada; Richmond, Virginia; Springfield, Missouri; Corpus Christi, Texas; Ft. Pierce, Florida; Rancho Cucamonga, California; Richmond,
Virginia and Albany, New York contributed approximately $6.9 million of new revenue during fiscal 2003.

Yard
and fleet expenses were approximately $202.4 million during fiscal 2003, an increase of approximately $15.5 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2002. The increase in yard and fleet expenses
was due principally to the cost of handling increased volume at existing operations and the costs of new facilities. Approximately $7.3 million of the increase was the result of the acquisition
and opening of new facilities. Yard and fleet expenses from existing facilities grew by approximately $8.2 million, or 4%, compared to existing facility revenue growth of approximately


$24.1 million,
or 8%. Yard and fleet expenses decreased to 58% of revenues during fiscal 2003, as compared to 59% of revenues during fiscal 2002.

General
and administrative expenses were approximately $28.7 million during fiscal 2003, an increase of approximately $5.4 million, or 23%, over fiscal 2002. This increase was due
primarily to an increase of approximately $2.5 million in payroll expense, $1.0 million in professional services, $0.6 million in frame connectivity charges and
$1.3 million in various other general and administrative items. General and administrative expenses increased to 8% of revenues during fiscal 2003, as compared to 7% of revenues during fiscal
2002.

Depreciation
and amortization expense was approximately $25.5 million during fiscal 2003, an increase of approximately $9.2 million, or 57%, over fiscal 2002. This increase was due
primarily to depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures and covenants not to compete and depreciation of acquired assets resulting from the acquisition of new auction facilities. Growth in
capital spending in fiscal 2003 and prior periods is expected to result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods.

Total
other income was approximately $3.4 million during fiscal 2003, a decrease of approximately $0.3 million, or 8% from fiscal 2002. The decrease is due primarily to a reduction in
proceeds from the sale of certain fixed assets of approximately $0.5 million, due to fewer disposals in fiscal 2003. Interest income decreased approximately $0.2 million due to lower
interest rates and a reduction in the cash balance. These decreases were offset by an increase in rental income of approximately $0.4 million.

Our
effective combined federal, state and local income tax rate for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 was 39%.

Due
to the foregoing factors, we realized net income of approximately $57.2 million for fiscal 2003, compared to net income of approximately $57.4 million for fiscal 2002.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001

Revenues were approximately $316.5 million during fiscal 2002, an increase of approximately $62.6 million, or 25%, over fiscal 2001. The increase was due
primarily to increased volume and buyer fees at existing facilities, which contributed approximately $50.9 million in revenue and to new facilities (identified below), which contributed
$11.7 million of new revenue.

New
facilities in or near New Castle, Delaware; Savannah, Georgia; Tifton, Georgia; Charleston, West Virginia; Lyman, Maine; Tucson, Arizona; Somerville, New Jersey; Haslet, Texas; Amarillo, Texas and
Greencastle, Pennsylvania contributed $11.7 million of new revenue during fiscal 2002.

Yard
and fleet expenses were approximately $187.0 million during fiscal 2002, an increase of approximately $34.9 million, or 23%, over fiscal 2001. The increase in yard and fleet
expenses was due principally to the cost of handling increased volume at existing operations and the costs of new facilities. Approximately $11.2 million of the increase was the result of the
acquisition and opening of new facilities. Yard and fleet expenses from existing facilities grew by approximately $23.7 million, or 16%, compared to existing facility revenue growth of
approximately $50.9 million, or 20%. Yard and fleet expenses decreased to 59% of revenues during fiscal 2002, as compared to 60% of revenues during fiscal 2001.

General
and administrative expenses were approximately $23.3 million during fiscal 2002, an increase of approximately $3.9 million, or 20%, over fiscal 2001. The increase was due
primarily to an increase of approximately $1.7 million in payroll expense, $0.4 million in professional services, $0.4 million in frame connectivity charges and
$1.4 million in various other general and administrative items. General and administrative expenses decreased to 7% of revenues during fiscal 2002, as compared to 8% of revenues during fiscal
2001.

Depreciation
and amortization expense was approximately $16.3 million during fiscal 2002, an increase of approximately $2.0 million, or 14%, over fiscal 2001. This increase was due
primarily to depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures and covenants not to compete and depreciation of acquired assets resulting from the acquisition of new auction facilities. The
adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 142 reduced goodwill amortization expense by approximately $2.6 million for fiscal 2002. On a pro forma basis, if the
Company had applied Statement No. 142 during the prior year, goodwill amortization expense in fiscal 2001 would have been reduced by approximately $2.4 million.


Total
other income was approximately $3.7 million during fiscal 2002, an increase of approximately $0.8 million, or 27% over fiscal 2001. The increase was due primarily to increased
interest income of approximately $0.4 million earned on the $126 million raised in our November 2001 follow-on offering, a disposal proceeds increase of approximately
$0.6 million from the sale of certain fixed assets and a decrease of approximately $0.5 million in interest expense resulting from a reduction in total debt. The increase was offset by a
legal settlement of approximately $0.7 million obtained in fiscal 2001.

Our
effective combined federal, state and local income tax rate of 39% for fiscal 2002 was lower than the combined rate of 40% for fiscal 2001, due to changes in estimated state income tax rates.

Due
to the foregoing factors, we realized net income of approximately $57.4 million for fiscal 2002, compared to net income of approximately $42.7 million for fiscal 2001.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have financed our growth through cash generated from operations, public offerings of common stock, the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt
financing. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately $15.9 million in fiscal 2003 and increased by approximately $117.4 million in fiscal 2002. The increase in fiscal 2002 was
primarily attributable to a December 2001 public offering of our common stock in which we raised net proceeds of approximately $126.1 million. The decrease in fiscal 2003 was primarily
attributable to capital expenditures and our stock repurchase program announced in March 2003. Our liquidity and capital resources have not been materially affected by inflation. During the
winter months, most of our facilities process 10% to 30% more vehicles than at other times of the year. This increased seasonal volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and
handling costs of the additional business.

As
of July 31, 2003, we had working capital of approximately $171.6 million, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately $116.7 million. Our primary source of cash is
from the collection of sellers' fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of auctioned salvage vehicles and from buyers' fees. We believe that we are able to process, market, sell and receive
payment for processed vehicles quickly.

We
believe that our currently available cash, cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities and equipment leasing lines will be sufficient to satisfy our
operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, if we experience significant growth in the future, we may be required to raise additional cash through the
issuance of new debt or additional equity.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.9 million from fiscal 2002 to $79.1 million in fiscal 2003, due to the timing of routine changes in
working capital items.

Investing Activities

Capital expenditures (excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions) were approximately $70.7 million, $85.9 million and
$45.9 million for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our capital expenditures have related primarily to opening and improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment.

During
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2003, we used cash for the acquisition of operations in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania; Reno, Nevada and Richmond, Virginia, which had an aggregate cash cost
of approximately $6.6 million. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2002, we used cash and common stock for the acquisition of operations in New Castle, Delaware; Savannah, Georgia;
Tifton, Georgia; Charleston, West Virginia; Haslet, Texas and Greencastle, Pennsylvania. The consideration paid consisted of an aggregate cash cost of approximately $8.6 million and
approximately $25.7 million in common stock. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2001, we used cash for the acquisition of operations in Chatham, Virginia; Shreveport, Louisiana and
Mount Morris, Pennsylvania, which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately $5.1 million and approximately $0.9 million in common stock.

During
fiscal year ended July 31, 2002, we used common stock to purchase an existing facility, which we were leasing. The consideration paid consisted of approximately $2.3 million in
common stock.


Financing Activities

In fiscal 2002, we completed a follow-on public offering of 6.9 million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $19.33 per share, split
adjusted. We sold all of the shares and the offering raised $126.1 million after underwriting discounts and offering costs.

In
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, we generated approximately $0.4 million, $1.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, through the exercise of stock options.

In
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, we generated approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively, through the issuance of shares under the employee stock
purchase program.

In
February 2003, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 9 million shares of its Common Stock. The repurchases may be effected through solicited or
unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. No time limit has been placed on the duration of the share repurchase program. The repurchases will be made at such
times and in such amounts as Copart deems appropriate and may be discontinued at any time. As of October 16, 2003, the Company had repurchased a total of 3,672,300 additional shares at a
weighted average price of $8.49. The total number of shares currently available for repurchase under the plan is 5,327,700. The Company accounted for the repurchase of its Common Stock by charging
Common Stock for $31,170,400.

Credit Facilities

On February 23, 2001, we entered into a credit facility with our existing banking syndicate. The facility provided by Wells Fargo Bank, Fleet National Bank and U.S. Bank
National Association consists of an unsecured revolving reducing line of credit in the amount of $95 million that matures in 2006. As of July 31, 2003, the Company had available
$88.5 million under this facility, after taking into account $6.5 million of outstanding letters of credit. We are subject to customary covenants, including the following financial
covenants: 1) ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); 2) profitable operation; 3) leverage ratio and 4) interest
coverage ratio. The Company is in compliance with all covenants.

As
of July 31, 2003, we have agreements with certain financial institutions whereby the institutions will purchase approximately $15.5 million of yard and fleet equipment, which will be
leased back to us under operating leases.


Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS
No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This
Statement applies to legal obligations associated with retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal use of the asset. The adoption
of this standard had no impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
August 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. While SFAS No. 144 supercedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," it retains many of the
fundamental provisions of that Statement. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
August 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 145 "Rescission of SFAS Nos. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of SFAS 13, and Technical Corrections" ("SFAS 145"). SFAS No. 145
revises the criteria for classifying the extinguishment of debt as extraordinary and the accounting treatment of certain lease modifications. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the
Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
January 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs.
SFAS No. 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance, principally Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94-3. SFAS No. 146 requires that the liability for
costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF No. 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of a
company's commitment to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. Accordingly, SFAS No. 146 may affect the
timing of recognizing any future restructuring costs as well as the amount recognized. The provisions of this Statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December 31, 2002. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment of
FASB Statement No. 123." This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual
and interim financial statements.

In
July 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments With Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS No. 150 establishes
standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Many of these instruments were previously classified as equity.
SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability, or as an asset in some circumstances. This Statement applies to three types of
freestanding financial instruments, other than outstanding shares. One type is mandatorily redeemable shares, which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or assets; a
second type includes put options and forward purchase contracts that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets; the third type is
obligations that can be settled with shares, the monetary value of which is fixed, ties solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index, or varies inversely with the value of the issuers'
shares. SFAS No. 150 does not apply to features embedded in a financial instrument that is not a derivative in its entirety. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the Company's results
of operations, financial position or cash flows.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our principal exposure to financial market risk is interest rate risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our
investment portfolio of marketable securities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. We invest primarily in corporate securities, bank certificates, U.S.
Treasury and Agency Obligations, asset-backed securities, repurchase agreements, auction rate debt instruments and


money
market mutual funds and generally hold them to maturity. Consequently, we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio.

We
do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk. We do, however, limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and
strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios. At the present time, the maximum duration of all portfolios is 90 days or less. Our guidelines also establish
credit quality standards, limits on exposure to any one issue as well the type of instruments. Due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria in our guidelines, we do not expect that our
exposure to market and credit risk will be material.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Copart, Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Copart, Inc. and subsidiaries ("the Company") as of July 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended July 31, 2003. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the related financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Copart, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 31,
2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended July 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective August 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets."

COPART, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

July 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices

Description of Business

Copart, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("the Company") provide vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance companies, with a full range of services to process and sell salvage
vehicles through auctions, principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees and used vehicle dealers.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues, which generally consist of salvage fees charged to vehicle suppliers and buyers, are generally recorded at the date the vehicles are sold at auction. No provision for
returns has been established, as all sales are final with no right of return.

Yard and Fleet Expenses

Yard and fleet expenses consist primarily of operating personnel (which includes yard management, clerical and yard employees), rent, contract vehicle towing, insurance, fuel,
fleet maintenance and repair, and the cost of vehicles acquired and sold by the Company under purchase contracts.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive, accounting and data processing, sales personnel, professional fees and marketing expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Vehicle Pooling Costs

Vehicle pooling costs consist of labor, towing, outside services and other costs directly attributable to the gathering and processing of vehicles prior to their sale. Vehicle
pooling costs are recognized as expenses in the period the vehicle is sold at auction. The Company continually evaluates and adjusts the components of vehicle pooling costs as necessary.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of the lease terms or the useful lives of the respective assets.

Depreciation
is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of: 3 to 7 years for transportation and other equipment; 5 to 10 years for office furniture
and equipment; and 15 to 40 years or life of lease, whichever is shorter, for buildings and leasehold improvements.


Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist primarily of covenants not to compete and options to purchase leased property. Amortization, except for the options to purchase leased property, is
provided on the straight-line basis over the estimated lives, which range from 5 to 7 years.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The amounts recorded for financial instruments in the Company's consolidated financial statements, which include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, accrued liabilities and capital lease obligations approximate fair value as of July 31, 2003 and 2002.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share amounts were computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share amounts were
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus dilutive potential common shares calculated for stock options outstanding using the treasury stock
method.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for its stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic-value-based method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

"Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees"

("APB 25"), and related interpretations, as allowed under SFAS No. 123,

"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"

("SFAS 123") (as amended by SFAS
No. 148,

"Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure"

("SFAS 148"). Accordingly, compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the Company's
stock at the date of the grant over the price the employee must pay to acquire the stock. Options granted to consultants and other non-employees are accounted for at fair value.

In
the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS 148, which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. The Statement also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect of the methods used on reported results.

Pro
forma information regarding net income and net income per share is required by SFAS No. 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for options granted under its plans
using the fair value method. For these purposes, the fair value of options issued under the Plans was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions: no dividend yield, volatility factor of the expected market price of the Company's stock of 0.40, a forfeiture rate of 0.06, a weighted-average expected life of the options of five years
and a risk-free interest rate of 2.9%, 3.8% and 4.8% for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The weighted average fair value of options granted were $3.98, $9.36 and $12.16, for 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period. The effects of applying SFAS
No. 123 in this pro forma disclosure are not indicative of future results.


For
purposes of pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123 and SFAS 148, the estimated compensation expense related to option grants to employees that would have been recognized in fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001 is deducted from net income. The Company's pro forma information related to option grants to employees as calculated in accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS 148 is as
follows:

Comprehensive Income

The Company has no items of other comprehensive income in any period presented. Therefore, net income as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income equals comprehensive
income.

Segment Reporting

All of the Company's facilities are aggregated into one reportable segment given the similarities of economic characteristics between the operations represented by the
facilities and the common nature of the products, customers and methods of revenue generation.

Use of Estimates

Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Business Combinations and Goodwill

On August 1, 2001, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations,"
and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and that certain acquired
intangible assets be recognized as assets apart from goodwill. The adoption of SFAS No. 141 had no impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position. SFAS No. 142
provides that goodwill should not be amortized but instead be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level. The Company's annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003. The results of this test indicated that goodwill was not impaired.


The
following table reflects the consolidated results adjusted as though the adoption of SFAS No. 142 occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2001:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated
by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property and equipment exceeds its fair market
value.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS
No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This
Statement applies to legal obligations associated with retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal use of the asset. The adoption
of this standard had no impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
August 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. While SFAS No. 144 supercedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the Company's results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.


COPART, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

July 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (Continued)

In August 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 145 "Rescission of SFAS Nos. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of SFAS 13, and Technical Corrections"
("SFAS 145"). SFAS No. 145 revises the criteria for classifying the extinguishment of debt as extraordinary and the accounting treatment of certain lease modifications. The adoption of
this standard had no impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
January 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs.
SFAS No. 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance, principally Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94-3. SFAS No. 146 requires that the liability for
costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF No. 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of a
company's commitment to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. Accordingly, SFAS No. 146 may affect the
timing of recognizing any future restructuring costs as well as the amount recognized. The provisions of this Statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December 31, 2002. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In
December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment of
FASB Statement No. 123." This Statement amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this
Statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements.

In
July 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments With Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity." SFAS No. 150 establishes
standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Many of these instruments were previously classified as equity.
SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability, or as an asset in some circumstances. This Statement applies to three types of
freestanding financial instruments, other than outstanding shares. One type is mandatorily redeemable shares, which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or assets; a
second type includes put options and forward purchase contracts that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets; the third type is
obligations that can be settled with shares, the monetary value of which is fixed, ties solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index, or varies inversely with the value of the issuers'
shares. SFAS No. 150 does not apply to features embedded in a financial instrument that is not a derivative in its entirety. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the Company's results
of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' financial statements to conform to the classifications used in 2003.

(2) Acquisitions

Fiscal 2003 Transactions

During fiscal 2003 the Company made the following three acquisitions: Greater Pittsburgh Auto Auction, Inc. of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania; E.W.E. Salvage Pool &
Auto Auction, Inc. of Reno, Nevada and Richmond Auto Auction of Virginia, Inc. of Richmond, Virginia. The consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of $6,604,000 in cash. The
acquired net assets consisted of accounts and advances receivable, inventory, fixed assets, land, buildings, goodwill, and covenants not to compete. The acquisitions were accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting, and the operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates are included in the Company's consolidated statements of income. These new facilities contributed
$5.1 million of revenues during fiscal 2003. The excess of the purchase price


over
the fair market value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $5,784,300 has been recorded as goodwill. The Company estimates the entire goodwill balance relating to these acquisitions will be
deductible for tax purposes. In addition, the Company paid $426,700 for covenants not to compete relating to these acquisitions, which are being amortized over five to seven years, based upon the
agreements. In conjunction with the West Mifflin, Pennsylvania; Reno, Nevada and Richmond, Virginia acquisitions, the Company entered into leases for the use of these facilities.

Fiscal 2002 Transactions

During fiscal 2002 the Company made the following six acquisitions: Delaware Public Auto Auction, of New Castle, Delaware; Sadisco, of Savannah, Georgia; Sadisco of Tifton,
Georgia; Capital Auto Salvage, of Charleston, West Virginia; North Texas Insurance Auto Auction, L.P., of Haslet, Texas and Mason-Dixon Auto Auction, of Greencastle, PA. The consideration paid for
these acquisitions consisted of $8,561,100 in cash and 1,550,987 shares of common stock valued at approximately $25,691,900. The acquired net assets consisted of accounts and advances receivable,
inventory, fixed assets, land, buildings, goodwill, and covenants not to compete. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the operating results subsequent to
the acquisition dates are included in the Company's consolidated statements of income. These new facilities contributed $11.6 million of revenues during fiscal 2002. The excess of the purchase
price over the fair market value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $20,166,700 has been recorded as goodwill. The Company estimates $16,566,700 of the total goodwill balance relating to these
acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes. In addition, the Company paid $2,100,000 for covenants not to compete relating to these acquisitions, which are being amortized over five to seven
years, based upon the agreements. In conjunction with the New Castle, Delaware; Savannah, Georgia; Tifton, Georgia; Charleston, West Virginia and Haslet, Texas acquisitions, the Company entered into
leases for the use of these facilities.

Fiscal 2001 Transactions

During fiscal 2001 the Company made the following three acquisitions: Auto Salvage Disposal, Inc., of Chatham, Virginia; Twin City Salvage Pool, Inc., of
Shreveport, Louisiana and Mountain State Auto Auction, Inc., of Mount Morris, Pennsylvania. The consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of $5,099,000 in cash and 65,624 shares of
common stock valued at approximately $862,700. The acquired net assets consisted of accounts and advances receivable, inventory, fixed assets, goodwill, and covenants not to compete. The acquisitions
were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates are included in the
Company's consolidated statements of income. These new facilities contributed $1.9 million of revenues during fiscal 2001. The excess of the purchase price over fair market value of the net
identifiable assets acquired of $3,505,700 has been recorded as goodwill. In addition, the Company paid $150,000 for covenants not to compete relating to these acquisitions, which are being amortized
over the life of these agreements. In conjunction with the Chatham, Virginia; Shreveport, Louisiana and Mount Morris, Pennsylvania acquisitions, the Company entered into leases for the use of these
facilities.

Pro
forma financial information for these acquisitions does not result in a significant change from actual results for 2003 and 2002.

On February 23, 2001, the Company entered into a credit facility with our existing banking syndicate. The facility provided by Wells Fargo Bank, Fleet National Bank and U.S.
Bank National Association consists of an unsecured revolving reducing line of credit in the amount of $95 million that matures in 2006. As of July 31, 2003, the Company had available
$88.5 million under this facility, after taking into account $6.5 million of outstanding letters of credit.


The
Company is subject to customary covenants, including the following financial covenants: 1) ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA);
2) profitable operation; 3) leverage ratio and 4) interest coverage ratio. The Company is in compliance with all covenants.

(8) Shareholders' Equity

In fiscal 2002, the Company declared a three-for-two forward common stock split. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restated
to reflect the stock split.

In
fiscal 2002, the Company completed a follow-on public offering of 6.9 million shares of common stock at a price to the public of $19.33 per share. The Company sold all of the
shares and the offering raised $126.1 million after underwriting discounts and offering costs.

In
December 2001, the Company adopted the Copart, Inc. 2001 Stock Option Plan ("Plan"), presently covering an aggregate of 4,500,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock. The Plan
provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and non-qualified stock options to employees, officers, directors and consultants at prices not less than 100% and 85% of the
fair market value for incentive and non-qualified stock options, respectively, as determined by the Board of Directors at the grant date. Incentive and non-qualified stock
options may have terms of up to ten years and vest over periods determined by the Board of Directors. Options generally vest ratably over a five-year period. The Plan replaces the
Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan ("1992 Plan") which expired in August 2002.

In
March 1994, the Company adopted the Copart, Inc. 1994 Director Option Plan under which an aggregate of 240,000 shares of the Company's common stock are presently reserved. In general,
new non-employee directors will automatically receive grants of non-qualified stock options to purchase 18,000 shares and subsequent grants to purchase 9,000 additional shares
upon election and each subsequent re-election to the Company's board of directors, respectively.

The
Company has authorized the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value, none of which are issued or outstanding at July 31, 2003.

The
Copart, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") provides for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company by employees pursuant to the terms of
the ESPP. The number of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the ESPP during each of fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was 204,753, 117,033 and 141,331, respectively.

In
February 2003, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 9 million shares of its Common Stock. The repurchases may be effected through solicited or
unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. No time limit has been placed on the duration of the share repurchase program. The repurchases will be made at such
times and in such amounts as Copart deems appropriate and may be discontinued at any time. As of July 31, 2003, the Company had repurchased a total of 2,695,200 shares at a weighted average
price of $7.59 per share. The Company accounted for the repurchase of its Common Stock by charging Common Stock for $20,447,300.

In
March 2003, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan. Under the plan, the Company will issue a dividend of one right for each share of its common stock held by
shareholders of record as of the close of business on Friday, March 21, 2003.

Based on the Company's historical operating earnings, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded and,
accordingly, has not established a valuation allowance.

In
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $377,700, $2,817,300 and $2,026,400, respectively, upon the exercise of certain stock options which is reflected in shareholders'
equity.

and 2002, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares. No
options were anti-dilutive for fiscal year 2001.

(11) Major Customers

In fiscal 2003, two customers accounted for 13% and 8% of the Company's revenues, respectively. In fiscal 2002, these two customers accounted for 14% and 9%, and in fiscal
2001, they accounted for 13% and 9% of the Company's revenues, respectively. At July 31, 2003 these two customers accounted for 17% and 7% of accounts receivable, respectively. At
July 31, 2002 they accounted for 13% and 7%, and at July 31, 2001 they accounted for 10% and 6% of accounts receivable, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 4% of
revenues.

(12) Commitments and Contingencies

Leases:

The Company leases certain facilities under operating leases and in some cases has either a right of first refusal to acquire or option to purchase certain facilities at fair
value. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Facilities rental expense for the fiscal
years ended July 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 aggregated, $15,481,000, $14,084,000 and $11,987,000, respectively.

As
of July 31, 2003, the Company has agreements with certain financial institutions whereby the institutions will purchase approximately $15.5 million of yard and fleet equipment, which
will be leased back under operating leases. Yard and fleet equipment rental expense for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 aggregated approximately, $10,183,600, $9,140,700 and
$7,000,000, respectively.

Noncancelable
future minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year at July 31, 2003 are as follows:

Commitments:

The Company had outstanding letters of credit of $6.5 million at July 31, 2003. These letters of credit secure certain insurance obligations.

Contingencies:

The Company is involved in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business, such as actions related to injuries, property damage or handling or disposal
of vehicles. Among this litigation is a lawsuit filed in Massachusetts against the Company which purports to be a class action on behalf of persons whose vehicles were disposed of by the Company as
abandoned vehicles, which the claimant contends were disposed of without complying with State laws. Lawsuits filed in California against the Company and rental car company vehicle suppliers, which
purported to be class actions on behalf of California residents who owned previously damaged rental car vehicles that were sold through auctions on clean titles, have been dismissed without prejudice,
and the individual claims have been settled and the Company has received, or anticipates receipt of, dismissals with prejudice of all individual claims. On June 13, 2003 the Company received
notice from the United States Department of Labor ("DOL") that the Company's former Chief Financial Officer, had filed a complaint with the DOL alleging that Copart had terminated his
employment in violation of Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. By the end of June 2003, Copart had settled the dispute, the DOL complaint filed against the Company was
withdrawn, and the DOL advised the Company that it had closed its file on this matter. The Company is also involved in various governmental and administrative proceedings primarily relating to
licensing and operation. The Company provides for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on the
Company's future results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations, the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is not
feasible to determine the outcome of these matters, management believes that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

(13) Related Party Transactions

The Company leases certain of its facilities from affiliates of the Company under various lease agreements. Rental payments under these leases aggregated $548,200, $533,800 and
$681,500 for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and expire on various dates through 2005.

An
affiliate provided $413,100 of tow services to the Company in fiscal 2001.

(14) Employee Benefit Plan

The Company sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering its eligible employees. The plan is available to all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements
and provides employees with tax deferred salary deductions and alternative investment options. The Company matches 10% of employee contributions up to 15% of employee salary deferral.

(15) Noncash Financing and Investing Activities

In fiscal 2002, the Company acquired $18,487,000 of intangible assets and $9,505,900 of tangible assets through the issuance of common stock in conjunction with the New Castle,
Delaware; Savannah, Georgia; Tifton, Georgia; Haslet, Texas and Greencastle, Pennsylvania acquisitions and purchase of land at the Baton Rouge, Louisiana location. In fiscal 2002, the Company received
21,670 shares of common stock as payment for the exercise of 148,000 shares of common stock under the 1992 Stock Option Plan. The Company retired these shares upon receipt. In fiscal 2001, the Company
acquired $774,600 of intangible assets and $88,100 of tangible assets through the issuance of common stock in conjunction with the Shreveport, Louisiana acquisition.
