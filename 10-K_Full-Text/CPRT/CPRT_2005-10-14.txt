PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Copart, Inc. is a leading provider of salvage
vehicle sales services in the United States.

We provide vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance
companies, with a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles
over the Internet through our Virtual Bidding Second Generation (“VB


”) Internet auction-style sales technology. We sell
principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used
vehicle dealers and exporters. Salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles
deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes or are recovered stolen
vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already
been made. We offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite
each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and
processing costs. We generate revenues primarily from fees paid by vehicle
suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as
towing and storage.

We have grown our salvage vehicle sales business
through a combination of acquisitions and the development of new facilities and
also by increasing our buyer base and implementing additional value-added
services for both buyers and suppliers. For fiscal year 2005, our revenues were
approximately $457.1 million and our operating income was approximately $156.9
million. During the fiscal year ending July 31, 2005, we acquired two
salvage vehicle storage facilities and opened seven new salvage vehicle storage
facilities. We acquired storage sites located in Lexington, Kentucky and
Columbia, Missouri. We opened new vehicle storage sites in Strongsville, Ohio;
Ocala, Florida; Knoxville, Tennessee; Loganville, Georgia; Spokane, Washington;
Tallahassee, Florida and Hialeah, Florida.

During fiscal 2004, we converted all of our salvage
vehicle storage facilities to an Internet based auction-style model using VB


. This second generation technology combines two bidding
processes. An open Preliminary Bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids
either at a bidding station at the storage facility during the three preview
days or over the Internet. To improve the effectiveness of bidding, the VB


system lets a
buyer see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase. The preliminary
bidding phase is an open sales format. Buyers enter the maximum price they are
willing to pay for a vehicle and VB


’s BID4U
feature will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf. Preliminary bidding
ends one hour prior to the start of an Internet-only virtual sale. BID4U will
represent the high preliminary bidder at the Internet-only virtual sale. This
feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high
preliminary bidder. The bidders enter bids via the Internet in a real time
format. BID4U submits bids for the high preliminary bidder, up to their maximum
bid. When bidding stops, a countdown is initiated. If no bids are received
during the countdown, the vehicle sells to the highest bidder. VB


opens our sales process to registered buyers
anywhere in the world who have Internet access.

We believe the implementation of VB


across our salvage
operations has increased the pool of available buyers for each sale and the
added competition has increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for vehicles
from us. It has also improved the efficiency of our operations. For fiscal
2005, sales of vehicles to buyers outside the state where the vehicle is
located accounted for 46% of total vehicles sold; 25% of salvage vehicles were
sold to out of state buyers and 21% were sold to buyers out of country, based
on registration.

We believe that we
offer the highest level of service in the salvage vehicle sales and auction
industry and have established our leading market position as follows:

·

by
providing coverage that facilitates supplier access to buyers around the world,
reducing towing and third-party storage expenses, offering a local presence for
vehicle inspection stations, and providing prompt response to catastrophes and
natural disasters by specially-trained teams;


·

by
providing a comprehensive range of customer services that include merchandising
services, efficient title processing, timely pick-up and delivery of vehicles
and Internet sales;

·

by
establishing and efficiently integrating new facilities and acquisitions;

·

by
increasing the number of bidders that can participate at each sale through the
ease and convenience of Internet bidding;

·

by
applying technology to enhance operating efficiency through Internet bidding,
web-based order processing, salvage value quotes, electronic communication with
buyers and sellers, vehicle imaging and an electronic used vehicle parts
locator service; and

·

by
providing the venue for insurance customers through our Virtual Insured Exchange
“VIX” product to enter a vehicle into a live virtual sale to establish its true
value, thereby allowing the insurance customer to avoid dealing with estimated
values when negotiating with owners who wish to retain their damaged vehicles.

We have expanded our business beyond salvage vehicle
sales services and have entered the market for public sales of used vehicles.
We sell vehicles directly to the public and automobile dealers on behalf of
banks, leasing or financing companies, automobile dealers, repossession
companies and for our own account. Currently, we own six public automobile
sales facilities located in Detroit, Michigan; Chesapeake, Virginia; New
Castle, Delaware; Greencastle, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and
Richmond, Virginia. We operate our public automobile sales business under
Motors Auction Group, Inc. (“MAG”), a wholly owned subsidiary. To date,
revenues from our public sales business have not been significant relative to
the revenues from our salvage business.

We were organized as a
California corporation in 1982 and became a public company in 1994. Our
principal executive offices are located at 4665 Business Center Drive,
Fairfield, California 94534, and our telephone number at that address is (707)
639-5000. We maintain a website,

http://www.copart.com

,
where we make available, free of charge, our Securities and Exchange Commission
filings, including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,
current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports filed or
furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such
material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are
providing the address to our website solely for the information of investors.
Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference herein
and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.

Industry Overview

The salvage vehicle industry provides a venue for
salvage vehicle suppliers to liquidate total loss vehicles. Salvage vehicle
sales companies generally auction or sell salvage vehicles on consignment
either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price. On occasion, salvage
sales companies may purchase vehicles from vehicle suppliers at a formula-based
price, based on a percentage of the vehicles’ estimated pre-loss value (“actual
cash value”) and sell the vehicles for their own account. Salvage vehicle sales
companies typically operate from one or more salvage facilities where vehicles
are processed, viewed, stored and sold. However, Copart through the
introduction of VB


, eliminated
local live auctions in our operations, and we now sell all our salvage vehicles
over the Internet.

Although there are other suppliers of salvage
vehicles, such as financial institutions, vehicle leasing companies, automobile
rental companies, charities and automobile dealers, the primary source of
salvage vehicles is insurance companies.

Automobile manufacturers are incorporating certain
standard features that increase passenger safety, including unibody
construction, passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb
impacts,


plastic components,
airbags, xenon lights and computer systems. We believe that one effect of these
features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more likely to be
deemed a total loss for insurance purposes, which could result in an increasing
supply of total loss salvage vehicles in the future.

The primary buyers of salvage vehicles are vehicle
dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle dealers and exporters.
Vehicle dismantlers, which we believe are the largest group of salvage vehicle
buyers, either dismantle a vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the
entire vehicle to rebuilders, used vehicle dealers or the public. Vehicle
rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to
repair and resell. Used vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or
slightly damaged vehicles for resale.

Following an accident involving an insured vehicle,
the damaged vehicle is generally towed to a towing company or a vehicle repair
facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination. The
vehicle is inspected by the insurance company’s adjuster, who estimates the
costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged
vehicle’s mileage, options and condition in order to estimate its actual cash
value (fair market value). The adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs
or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate
of repair costs and the vehicle’s salvage value, as well as customer service
considerations. If the cost of repair is greater than the actual cash value
less the estimated salvage value, the insurance company generally will classify
the vehicle as a total loss. The insurance company will thereafter assign the
vehicle to a salvage vehicle sales company, settle with the insured vehicle
owner and receive title to the vehicle.

The primary factors
that vehicle suppliers consider when selecting a salvage vehicle sales company
include:

·

the
anticipated percentage return on salvage (i.e., gross salvage proceeds, minus
vehicle handling and selling expenses, divided by the actual cash value);

·

the
services provided by the salvage vehicle sales company and the degree to which
such services reduce administrative costs and expenses;

·

the
price the salvage vehicle sales company charges for its services;

·

national
coverage and ability to respond on a national scale; and

·

the
ability to generate custom seller reports.

Upon receipt of the pick up order (the assignment),
the salvage vehicle sales company arranges for the transport of a vehicle to a
facility. As a service to the vehicle supplier, the salvage vehicle sales
company will customarily pay advance charges (reimbursable charges paid on
behalf of vehicle suppliers) to obtain the subject vehicle’s release from a
towing company or vehicle repair facility. Typically, advance charges paid on
behalf of the vehicle supplier are recovered upon sale of the salvage vehicle.

The vehicle then remains
in storage until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle
owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s
motor vehicle regulatory agency (“DMV”). Total loss vehicles may be sold in
most states only after obtaining a salvage title from the DMV. Upon receipt of
the appropriate documentation from the DMV, which is generally received within
45 to 60 days of vehicle pick-up, the vehicle is sold.

Operating and Growth Strategy

Our growth strategy is to increase our revenues and
profitability by, among other things (i) acquiring and developing new
salvage vehicle storage facilities in key markets, (ii) pursuing national
and regional vehicle supply agreements, (iii) expanding our service
offerings to suppliers and buyers, (iv) increasing revenue and
profitability at our public automobile sales facilities and (v) expanding
the application of VB



into new markets. In
addition, we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and
attempt to affect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by
introducing our operational procedures, integrating our management information
systems and redeploying personnel when necessary.

As part of our overall
expansion strategy, our objective is to increase our revenues, operating
profits and market share in the vehicle sales industry. To implement our growth
strategy, we intend to continue to do the following:

Acquire and Develop New Salvage Vehicle Storage
Facilities in Key Markets

Our strategy is to offer integrated services to
vehicle suppliers on a national or regional basis by acquiring or developing
salvage facilities in new and existing markets. We integrate our new
acquisitions into our national network and capitalize on certain operating
efficiencies resulting from, among other things, the reduction of duplicative
overhead and the implementation of our operating procedures.

The
following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from August 1,
2002 through July 31, 2005.

Pursue National and Regional Vehicle Supply Agreements

Our broad national
presence enhances our ability to enter into local, regional or national supply
agreements with vehicle suppliers. We actively seek to establish national and
regional supply agreements with insurance companies by promoting our ability to
achieve high net returns and broader access to buyers through our national
coverage and electronic commerce capabilities. By utilizing our existing


insurance
company supplier relationships, we are able to build new supplier relationships
and pursue additional supply agreements in existing and new markets.

Expand Our Service Offerings to Suppliers and Buyers

Over the past several
years, we have expanded our available service offerings to vehicle suppliers
and buyers. The primary focus of these new service offerings is to maximize
returns to our suppliers and maximize product value to our buyers. Recent
service enhancements include, for our suppliers, real-time access to sales data
over the Internet and, for our buyers, the implementation of VB


real-time bidding
at all of our facilities, permitting buyers at any location worldwide to
participate in the sales at all of our yards in North America. We plan to
continue to refine and expand our services, including offering software that
can assist our suppliers in expediting claims and salvage management tools that
help suppliers integrate their systems with ours.

Increase Revenue and Profitability at Our Public Sales
Facilities

Our public automobile
sales facilities allow dealers to bid via the Internet and both dealers and the
general public to bid at live sales on a wide range of end-of-lease vehicles,
repossessed vehicles, dealer trade-ins and vehicles that we offer for sale on
our own account. To date, we have acquired six facilities and launched our
public automobile sales website.

Expand the Application of VB


into New Markets

We believe that the value
that VB


has demonstrated in the salvage vehicle sales
market, primarily by (i) increasing returns to sellers by expanding the
pool of bidders to any person in the world with access to the Internet and (ii) increasing
buyer convenience by eliminating the need to travel to the physical location of
the sale, can be beneficial to other industries. Accordingly, we will actively
explore the possible application of VB


outside of the salvage vehicle sales industry.

Our Competitive Advantages

We believe that the
following attributes and the services that we offer position us to take
advantage of many opportunities in the salvage vehicle sales industry.

National Coverage and Ability to Respond on a National
Scale

Since our inception
in 1982, we have expanded from a single facility in Vallejo, California to an
integrated network of 117 facilities located in the United States and Canada as
of July 31, 2005. We are able to offer integrated services on a national
basis to our vehicle suppliers, which allow us to respond to the needs of our
suppliers and buyers with maximum efficiency. Our national coverage provides
our suppliers with key advantages, including:

·

a
reduction in administrative time and effort;

·

a
reduction in overall vehicle towing costs;

·

convenient
local facilities;

·

improved
access to buyers throughout the world; and

·

a prompt response in the
event of a natural disaster or other catastrophe.


Value-Added Services

We believe that we
offer the most comprehensive range of services in our industry, including:

·

Internet
bidding, Internet proxy bidding and virtual sales powered by VB


,
which enhance the competitive bidding process;

·

on-line
payment capabilities via our ePay product;

·

e-mail
notifications to potential buyers of salvage vehicles that match desired
characteristics;

·

automatic
outbid notification by phone through VB


voice info;

·

sophisticated
vehicle processing at storage sites, including ten-view digital imaging of each
vehicle and the scanning of each vehicle’s title and other significant
documents such as body shop invoices, all of which are available from us
through the Internet;

·

CoPartfinder,
our Internet-based used vehicle parts locator that provides vehicle dismantlers
with greater resale opportunities for their salvage purchases; and

·

Offsite sales, which allow
vehicle suppliers to sell any vehicle, boat, or heavy equipment without
transporting it to one of our facilities.

Proven Ability to Acquire and Integrate Acquisitions

We have a proven
track record of successfully acquiring and integrating salvage vehicle storage
facilities. Since becoming a public company in 1994, we have completed the
acquisition of 60 salvage vehicle storage facilities. As part of our
acquisition and integration strategy, we seek to:

·

strengthen
our national network and access new markets;

·

utilize
our existing corporate and technology infrastructure over a larger base of
operations; and

·

introduce
our comprehensive services and operational expertise.

We strive to integrate all
new facilities into our existing network without disruption of service to
vehicle suppliers. We work with new suppliers to implement our fee structures
and new service programs. We typically retain existing employees at acquired
facilities in order to retain knowledge about, and respond to, the local
market. We also assign a special integration team to help convert newly
acquired facilities to our own management information and proprietary software
systems, enabling us to ensure a smooth and consistent transition to our
business operating and sales systems.

Technology to Enhance and Expand Our Business

We have developed
management information and proprietary software systems that allow us to
deliver a fully integrated service offering. Our proprietary software programs
provide vehicle suppliers with online access to data and reports regarding
their salvage vehicles being processed at any of our facilities. This
technology allows vehicle suppliers to monitor each stage of our salvage
vehicle sales process, from pick up to sale and settlement by the buyer. Our
full range of Internet services allows us to expedite each stage of the salvage
vehicle sales process and minimizes the administrative and processing costs for
us as well as our suppliers. We believe that our integrated technology systems
generate improved capacity and financial returns for our clients, resulting in
high client retention, and allow us to expand our national supply contracts.


Our Service Offerings

We offer vehicle suppliers
a full range of services, which expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle
sales process, maximizing proceeds and minimizing costs.

Online Supplier Access

Through Copart Access, our
Internet-based service for vehicle suppliers, we enable suppliers to assign
vehicles for sale, check sales calendars, view vehicle images and history, view
and reprint body shop invoices and towing receipts and view the historical
performance of the vehicles sold at our sales.

Salvage Estimation Services

We offer Copart ProQuote,
a proprietary service that assists suppliers in the vehicle claims evaluation
process by providing online salvage value estimates, which helps suppliers
determine whether to repair a particular vehicle or deem it a total loss.

Virtual Insured Exchange (“VIX”)

We provide the venue for
insurance customers to enter a vehicle into a live virtual auction-style sale
to establish its true value, thereby allowing the insurance customer to avoid
dealing with estimated values when negotiating with owners who wish to retain
their damaged vehicles.

Transportation Services

We maintain contracts with
third-party vehicle transport companies, which enables us to pick up most of
our suppliers’ vehicles within 24 hours. Our national network and
transportation capabilities provides cost and time savings to our vehicle
suppliers and ensures on-time vehicle pick up and prompt response to
catastrophes and natural disasters.

Vehicle Inspection Stations

We offer certain of our
major insurance company suppliers office and yard space to house vehicle
inspection stations on-site at our storage facilities. We have over 30 vehicle
inspection stations at our facilities nationwide. An on-site vehicle inspection
station provides our insurance company suppliers with a central location to
inspect potential total loss vehicles, which reduces storage charges that
otherwise, may be incurred at the initial storage or repair facility.

On-Demand Reporting

We provide vehicle
suppliers with on-demand reports online, via fax or e-mail that summarize data
on salvage vehicles that we process for the particular supplier. These reports
track our vehicle suppliers’ gross and net returns on each vehicle, service
charges, and other data that enable our vehicle suppliers to more easily
administer and monitor the salvage vehicle disposition process.

DMV Processing

We have extensive
expertise in DMV document and title processing for salvage vehicles. We have
developed a computer system which provides a direct link to the DMV computer
systems of several states. This allows us to expedite the processing of vehicle
title paperwork.

Flexible Vehicle Processing Programs

At the election of the vehicle supplier, we sell
vehicles pursuant to our Percentage Incentive Program consignment basis or on a
fixed fee consignment basis.


Percentage
Fee Consignment.

Our
Percentage Incentive Program (“PIP”) is an innovative processing program
designed to broadly serve the needs of vehicle suppliers. Under PIP, we agree
to sell all of the salvage vehicles of a vehicle supplier in a specified market
usually for a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price. Because our
revenues under PIP are directly linked to the vehicle’s sale price, we have an
incentive to actively merchandise those vehicles to maximize the net return on
salvage vehicles. We provide the vehicle supplier, at our expense, with
transport of the vehicle to our nearest facility, storage for up to 90 days and
DMV document and title processing. In addition, we provide merchandising
services such as covering or taping openings to protect vehicle interiors from
weather, washing vehicle exteriors, vacuuming vehicle interiors, cleaning and
polishing dashboards and tires, making keys for driveable vehicles and
identifying driveable vehicles. We believe our merchandising efforts increase
the sales prices of salvage vehicles, thereby increasing the return on salvage
vehicles to both vehicle suppliers and us. In fiscal year 2005, 2004 and 2003,
we processed approximately 68%, 65% and 67%, respectively, of all our salvage
vehicles under PIP.

Fixed Fee Consignment.

Under our fixed fee consignment program, we sell
vehicles for a fixed consignment fee, generally $50 to $175 per vehicle.
Although sometimes included in the consignment fee, we may also charge
additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility,
storage of the vehicle, and other incidental costs. In fiscal year 2005, 2004
and 2003, we processed approximately 32%, 35% and 33%, respectively, of all our
salvage vehicles under the fixed fee consignment program.

Buyer Network

We maintain a database of
thousands of registered buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling,
rebuilding, repair, resale and exporting businesses. Our database includes each
buyer’s vehicle preference and purchasing history. This data enables us to
notify via e-mail prospective buyers throughout the world of salvage vehicles
available for bidding that match their vehicle preferences. Listings of salvage
vehicles to be sold on a particular day and location are also made available on
the Internet.

Sales Process

We offer a flexible and
unique sales process designed to maximize the sale prices of the vehicles. We
utilize VB


, an auction-style
sales methodology that we developed. This second generation technology combines
two bidding processes. An open Preliminary Bidding feature allows a buyer to
enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility during the three
preview days or over the Internet. To improve the effectiveness of bidding, the
VB


system lets a buyer see the current high bid
on the vehicle they want to purchase. The preliminary bidding phase is an open
sales format. Buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a
vehicle and BID4U will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf.
Preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an Internet-only
virtual sale. BID4U will represent the high preliminary bidder at the
Internet-only virtual sale. This feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid
against each other and the high preliminary bidder. The bidders enter bids via
the Internet in a real time format. BID4U submits bids for the high preliminary
bidder, up to their maximum bid. When bidding stops, a countdown is initiated.
If no bids are received during the countdown, the vehicle sells to the highest
bidder. VB


opens our sales process to registered buyers
anywhere in the world who have Internet access.

CoPartfinder

CoPartfinder is our unique
Internet “search engine” that enables users to locate used vehicle parts
quickly and efficiently. CoPartfinder is accessible by the public through a
Copart-sponsored website. CoPartfinder lists vehicles recently sold at our
sales and identifies certain purchasers. This allows vehicle dismantlers and
other resellers to streamline their parts sale process and access a large pool
of potential buyers. We charge a nominal fee to potential parts buyers, who can
use CoPartfinder to search for specific


vehicle
makes and models and view digital images of vehicles that meet their
requirements. Once a specific parts supplier is identified for a specific part
requirement, buyers may have the option to call, fax, or e-mail the
dismantler/supplier. We believe that CoPartfinder provides an incentive for
vehicle dismantlers to purchase their salvage vehicles through our sales
process.

Supply
Arrangements and Supplier Marketing

We obtain salvage vehicles from hundreds of different
vehicle suppliers. State Farm Insurance Company accounted for 12%, 12% and 13%
of our revenues for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Of the
total number of vehicles that we processed in fiscal year 2005, 2004 and 2003,
we obtained approximately 79%, 85% and 85%, respectively from insurance company
suppliers. Our arrangements with our suppliers are either written or oral
agreements that are typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30
to 90 days notice.

We typically contract with the regional or branch
office of an insurance company or other vehicle suppliers. The agreements are
customized to each vehicle supplier’s particular needs and often provide for
the disposition of different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods.
Our contracts or arrangements generally provide that we will sell total loss
and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the vehicle supplier in a designated
geographic area.

We market our services to
vehicle suppliers through an in-house sales force that utilizes a variety of
sales techniques, including targeted mailing of our sales literature,
telemarketing, follow-up personal sales calls, and participation in trade shows
and vehicle and insurance industry conventions. Based upon our historical data
on salvage vehicles and vehicle information supplied by vehicle suppliers, our
marketing personnel will provide vehicle suppliers with detailed analysis of
the net return on salvage vehicles and a proposal setting forth ways in which
we believe that we can improve net returns on salvage vehicles and reduce
administrative costs and expenses.

Buyers

We maintain a database of
thousands of registered buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling,
rebuilding, repair, resale and export businesses. We believe that we have
established a broad international and domestic buyer base by providing buyers
of salvage vehicles with a variety of programs and services. To gain admission
to one of our sales and become a registered buyer, prospective buyers must
first pay an initial registration fee and an annual fee, provide requested
personal and business information and have, in most states, a vehicle
dismantler’s, dealer’s, resale, repair license or export license. Registration
entitles a buyer to transact business at any of our sales subject to local
licensing and permitting requirements. A buyer may also bring guests to a
facility to preview vehicles for sale for a fee. Strict admission procedures
are intended to prevent frivolous bids that would invalidate the sale. We
market to buyers on the Internet and via e-mail notifications, sales notices,
telemarketing and participation in trade show events.

Competition

We face significant
competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those
vehicles. We believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction and
sales companies and vehicle dismantlers. These national, regional and local
competitors may have established relationships with vehicle suppliers and
buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than ours. The largest
national or regional vehicle auctioneers include the ADESA Corporation, Auction
Broadcasting Company, Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc., Manheim Auctions and
SADISCO. The largest national dismantlers include Greenleaf and LKQ
Corporation. These national dismantlers, in addition to trade groups of
dismantlers such as the


American
Recycling Association and the United Recyclers Group, may purchase salvage
vehicles directly from insurance companies, thereby bypassing auction and sales
companies entirely, including us.

Management Information Systems

Our primary management information system consists of
an IBM AS/400 mainframe computer system, integrated computer interfaces and
proprietary business operating software that we developed and which tracks
salvage and public sales vehicles throughout the sales process. We call this
proprietary business operating software the Copart Auction System (“CAS”) and
have implemented CAS at all of our salvage storage facilities. For the public
sales business we call this proprietary business operating software Motors
Auction Exchange (“MAX”). In addition, we have integrated our mainframe
computer system with Internet and Intranet systems in order to provide secure
access to CAS and MAX data and images in a variety of formats.

Our auction-style service product, VB


, is served by an array of identical high-density,
high-performance servers. Each individual sale is configured to run on an
available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any other
available server in the array as required. Our Sale, Internet and Imaging
services are load balanced across different geographical data centers.

We have invested in a new
production data center that is designed to run the business in the event of an
emergency. The facility’s electrical and mechanical systems are continually
monitored. This facility is located in an area considered to be free of weather
related disasters and earthquakes.

Employees

As of July 31, 2005,
we had approximately 2,421 full-time employees, of whom approximately 252 were
engaged in general and administrative functions and approximately 2,169 were
engaged in yard and fleet operations. We are not currently subject to any
collective bargaining agreements and believe our relationships with our
employees are good.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various laws and
regulations regarding the protection of the environment. In the salvage vehicle
sales industry, large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at facilities and,
during that time, spills of fuel, motor oils and other fluids may occur,
resulting in soil, surface water or groundwater contamination. Certain of our
facilities store petroleum products and other hazardous materials in
above-ground containment tanks and some of our facilities generate waste
materials such as solvents or used oils that must be disposed of as
non-hazardous or hazardous waste, as appropriate. We have implemented
procedures to reduce the amount of soil contamination that may occur at our
facilities, and we have initiated safety programs and training of personnel on
the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials. We believe that we are in
compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable environmental
regulations and we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to
remain in environmental compliance.

In connection with the acquisition of our Dallas,
Texas facility in 1994, we set aside $3.0 million to cover the costs of
environmental remediation, stabilization and related consulting expenses for a
six-acre portion of the facility that contained elevated levels of lead due to
the activities of the former operators. We began the stabilization process in
1996 and completed it in 1999. We paid all remediation and related costs from
the $3.0 million fund and, in accordance with the acquisition agreement,
distributed the remainder of the fund to the seller of the Dallas facility,
less $.2 million which was held back to cover the costs of obtaining the
no-further-action letter. In September 2002, our environmental engineering
consultant issued a report, which concludes that the soil stabilization has
effectively stabilized the lead-impacted soil, and that the concrete cap should
prevent impact to storm water and subsequent surface


water impact. Our
consultant thereafter submitted an Operations and Maintenance Plan (“Plan”) to
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) providing for a two-year
inspection and maintenance plan for the concrete cap, and a two-year ground and
surface water monitoring plan. In January of 2003, the TCEQ approved the
Plan, subject to the additions of upstream (background) surface water samples
from the intermittent stream adjacent to the facility and documentation of any
repairs to the concrete cap during the post closure-monitoring period. The
first semi-annual water sampling was conducted in April 2003, which
reflected that the lead-impacted, stabilized soil is not impacting the ground
and/or surface water. The second round of semi-annual water samples collected
in October and November 2003 reported concentration of lead in one
storm water and one surface water sample in excess of the established upstream
criteria for lead. In correspondence, which we received in July 2004, the
TCEQ approved with comment our water monitoring report dated February 24,
2004. The TCEQ instructed us to continue with post-closure monitoring and
maintenance activities and submit the next report in accordance with the
approved schedules. In February 2005, a report from our environmental
engineering consultant was transmitted to the TCEQ containing the results of
annual monitoring activities consisting of two (2) semi-annual sampling
events which occurred in April/June 2004 and October/November 2004.
Laboratory analytical results indicated no lead concentrations exceeding the
target concentration level set in the Corrective Measures Study for the site.
The Company’s environmental engineering consultant concluded in the February 2005
report to the TECQ that it is unlikely that lead concentrations detected in the
stormwater runoff samples are attributable to the lead impacted soils. Based on
the results of the 2004 samplings, we requested that no further action be taken
and that a closure letter be issued by the TCEQ. We are not assured of
receiving the no-further-action letter and we may incur further liabilities if
the stabilization process proves ineffective. In addition, in 1994, we detected
a small quantity of two hazardous substances in a temporary groundwater
monitoring well at the Dallas facility. Our environmental consultants concluded
that both substances arose from an off-site source and no further action was
recommended.

We do not believe that any
of the above environmental matters will, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Governmental Regulations

Our operations are subject
to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, provincial,
state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations. The acquisition and sale
of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by state and provincial
motor vehicle departments. In addition to the regulation of sales and
acquisitions of vehicles, we are also subject to various local zoning
requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities. These
zoning requirements vary from location to location. At various times, we may be
involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the
development and/or operation of our business facilities. We believe that we are
in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements.
We may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal, provincial,
state, and local governmental agencies in new markets.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved in litigation and damage claims
arising in the ordinary course of business, such as actions related to
injuries, property damage, handling or disposal of vehicles and patent
infringement. We are also involved in various governmental and administrative
proceedings primarily relating to licensing and operation of our business. Among
this litigation is a lawsuit filed by Ciano Dessources on May 21, 2003 in
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Superior Court Department against Copart of
Connecticut, Inc. and Copart, Inc. which purports to be a class
action on behalf of persons whose vehicles were disposed of by us as abandoned
vehicles, which the named plaintiff contends were disposed of without complying
with state laws.

Relief
sought included class certification, declaratory, remedial and/or injunctive
relief,


including
the ordering of a compliance program that will essentially protect consumers,
as well as damages, fees, and costs. Copart’s Motion for Summary Judgment was
granted on December 8, 2004, dismissing the class claim element of the
lawsuit. However this dismissal may be reconsidered, and may also be appealed
once the remaining individual claims of the named plaintiff are adjudicated.

On June 10, 2005, Manheim Services Corp. filed
suit against Copart, Inc. in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, alleging infringement of
Manheim’s assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,774,873. Relief sought included a
patent infringement judgment, an injunction prohibiting Copart from using any
infringing product or service (including VB


),
damages, fees, costs and expenses. On August 3, 2005, Copart denied
the claim and asserted counterclaims based on violations of antitrust laws and
common-law tortious interference. No trial date has yet been set.

On September 16, 2005, Richard M. Gray filed suit
against Copart and A. Safrin, in the State Court for the County of Chatham,
State of Georgia, alleging a class action for unreasonable amounts claimed for
storage liens by Copart, and related claims. Relief sought included class
certification, damages, fees, costs and expenses.

We provide for costs relating to these matters when a
loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the
outcome of these matters on our future results of operations cannot be
predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations, the
amount and timing of the resolution of such matters. We believe that any
ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. However, the amount of the liabilities associated
with these claims, if any, cannot be determined with certainty.


FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

We depend on a
limited number of major suppliers of salvage vehicles. The loss of one or more
of these major suppliers could adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition, and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply
could adversely affect our growth rates.

Historically, a limited number of vehicle suppliers
have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues. In fiscal 2005,
vehicles supplied by our two largest suppliers accounted for approximately 20%
of our revenues. Supplier arrangements are either written or oral agreements
typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice.
Vehicle suppliers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular
markets, which has affected the pricing for sales services in those markets.
There can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be cancelled.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into
future agreements with vehicle suppliers or that we will be able to retain our
existing supply of salvage vehicles. A reduction in vehicles from a significant
vehicle supplier or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a
substantial vehicle supplier could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a failure to
increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and
revenue growth rates.

Our strategic shift
from live salvage sales to an entirely Internet based sales model presents new
risks, including substantial technology risks.

In fiscal 2004, we
converted all our salvage sales from a live auction process to an entirely
Internet based auction-style model based on technology developed internally by
us. The conversion represents a significant change in the way we conduct
business and presents numerous risks, including our increased reliance on the
availability and reliability of our network systems. In particular, we believe
the conversion presents the following risks, among others:

·

Our
operating results in a particular period could be adversely affected in the
event our networks are not operable for an extended period of time for any
reason, as a result of Internet viruses, or as a result of any other
technological circumstance that makes us unable to conduct our virtual sales.

·

Our
business is increasingly reliant on internally developed technology, and we
have limited historic experience developing technologies or systems for
large-scale implementation and use.

·

The
change in our business model may make it more difficult for management,
investment analysts, and investors to model or predict our future operating
results until sufficient historic data is available to evaluate the effect of
the VB


implementation over a longer period of time
and in different economic environments.

·

Our
increasing reliance on proprietary technology subjects us to intellectual
property risks, including the risk of third party infringement claims or the
risk that we cannot establish or protect intellectual property rights in our
technologies. We have filed patent applications for VB


in the United States, Netherlands, and Europe,
but we cannot provide any assurances that patents will actually issue or that,
if issued, the patent could not later be found to be unenforceable or invalid. In
June 2005, Manheim Services Corp. filed suit against us in federal
district court in Georgia, alleging, among other things, that VB


infringes a patent assigned to Manheim. We intend
to defend the lawsuit vigoriously, but an adverse ruling, settlement, or
judgment, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operation.

Our results of
operations may not continue to benefit from the implementation of VB


to the extent we
have experienced in recent periods.

We believe that the implementation of our proprietary
VB


sales technologies across our salvage
operations has had a favorable impact on our results of operations by
increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base and increasing the
average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales. VB



was implemented across all
our salvage yards beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. We do not
believe, however, that we will continue to experience improvements in our
results of operations at the same relative rates we have experienced in the
last year.

In addition, we implemented VB


in our public
sales facilities. We cannot predict if, or to what extent, VB


will have a favorable impact on these
operations. Differences between our salvage and public operations, in
particular the relative importance of inspecting the vehicle being sold, may
result in our experiencing a negative or less favorable impact on our public
sales than we have experienced in our salvage sales.

Failure to have
sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our salvage
yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or
other suppliers of salvage vehicles.

Capacity at our salvage yards varies from period to
period and from region to region. For example, following adverse weather
conditions in a particular area, our yards in that area may fill and limit our
ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing
inventories. We regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and, where
appropriate, seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional
land and yards. We may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent
salvage yards in markets where we have limited excess capacity, and zoning
restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to
expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land. Failure to have
sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our
relationships with insurance companies or other suppliers of salvage vehicles,
which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

Factors such as
mild weather conditions in the United States can have an adverse effect on our
revenues and operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth
rates.

Mild weather conditions in the United States tend to
result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because
traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged. Accordingly, mild
weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories, which
would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating
results and related growth rates and could have an adverse effect on our operating
results. Conversely, our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such
as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weather-related conditions such as
flooding. During periods of mild weather conditions, our ability to increase
our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be
increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle suppliers
and to compete more effectively in the market, each of which is subject to the
other risks and uncertainties described in these sections.

High fuel prices in
the United States and Canada may have an adverse effect on our revenues and
operating results as well as our earnings growth rates.

Significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead
to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates. A
material reduction in accident rates could have a material impact on revenue
growth. In addition, under our PIP contracts the cost of towing the vehicle to
one of our facilities is included in the PIP fee. We may incur increased fees
which we will not be able to pass on to the insurance companies. A material
increase in tow rates could have a material impact on our operating results.

The salvage vehicle
sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete
successfully.

We face significant competition for the supply of
salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles. We believe our principal
competitors include other vehicle sales and auction companies with whom we
compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other
suppliers, and large vehicle dismantlers, who may buy salvage vehicles directly
from insurance companies, bypassing the salvage sales process. Many of the
insurance companies have established relationships with competitive sales and


auction companies and
large dismantlers. Many of our competitors may have greater financial resources
than us. Due to the limited number of vehicle suppliers, the absence of
long-term contractual commitments between us and our suppliers and the
increasingly competitive market environment, there can be no assurance that our
competitors will not gain market share at our expense.

We may also encounter significant competition for
local, regional and national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers. There
can be no assurance that the existence of other local, regional or national
contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse
effect on our business or our expansion plans. Furthermore, we are likely to
face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of salvage vehicle
sales facilities, which could significantly increase the cost of such
acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations. These potential new
competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses,
organized salvage vehicle buying groups, automobile manufacturers, automobile
auctioneers and software companies. While most vehicle suppliers have abandoned
or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service
providers such as us, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue,
which could adversely affect our market share, results of operations and
financial condition. Additionally, existing or new competitors may be
significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than
us; therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
successfully in the future.

Because the growth
of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of
new salvage vehicle sales facilities, the rate of growth of our business and
revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions
and development of new facilities.

We seek to increase
our sales and profitability through the acquisition of other salvage vehicle
sales facilities and the development of new salvage vehicle storage facilities.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to:

·

continue
to acquire additional facilities on favorable terms;

·

expand
existing facilities in no growth regulatory environments;

·

increase
revenues and profitability at acquired and new facilities;

·

maintain
the historical revenue and earnings growth rates we have been able to obtain
through facility openings and strategic acquisitions; or

·

create
new salvage vehicle storage facilities that meet our current revenue and
profitability requirements.

As we continue to
expand our operations, our failure to manage growth could harm our business and
adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to
manage growth is not only dependent on our ability to successfully integrate
new facilities, but also on our ability to:

·

hire,
train and manage additional qualified personnel;

·

establish
new relationships or expand existing relationships with vehicle suppliers;

·

identify
and acquire or lease suitable premises on competitive terms;

·

secure
adequate capital;

·

maintain
the supply of vehicles from vehicle suppliers; and

·

compete
successfully in the public automobile sales sector.


Our inability to control or manage these growth
factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.

Our annual and
quarterly performance may fluctuate, causing the price of our stock to decline.

Our revenues and
operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue
to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number
of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors that may affect our
operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:

·

fluctuations
in the market value of salvage and used vehicles;

·

the
availability of salvage vehicles;

·

variations
in vehicle accident rates;

·

buyer
participation in the Internet bidding process;

·

delays
or changes in state title processing;

·

changes
in state or federal laws or regulations affecting salvage vehicles;

·

changes
in state laws affecting who may purchase salvage vehicles;

·

our
ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully;

·

the
timing and size of our new facility openings;

·

the
announcement of new vehicle supply agreements by us or our competitors;

·

severity
of weather and seasonality of weather patterns;

·

the
amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the
maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;

·

the
availability and cost of general business insurance;

·

labor
costs and collective bargaining;

·

availability
of subhaulers at competitive rates;

·

acceptance
of buyers and sellers of our Internet-based model deploying VB


,
a proprietary Internet auction-style sales technology;

·

current
levels of out of state and foreign demand for salvage vehicles may not
continue;

·

the
introduction of a similar Internet product by a competitor; and

·

the
ability to obtain necessary permits to operate salvage storage facilities.

Due to the foregoing factors, our operating results in
one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate. As a result, we
believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not
necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of
future performance. In the event such fluctuations result in our financial
performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and
investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.


Our strategic shift to an
Internet based sales model has increased the relative importance of
intellectual property assets to our business, and any inability to protect
those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, or results of operations.

Implementation of VB


across our salvage operations and more
recently in our public sales has increased the relative importance of
intellectual property rights to our business. Our intellectual property rights
include pending patent applications for VB


as well as trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights
and other intellectual property rights. We are in the process of prosecuting an
initial patent application relating to VB


and cannot predict whether a patent will
actually issue from that application. Even if a patent is issued, the scope of
the protection gained may be insufficient or any issued patent could
subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable. In addition, we are
increasingly entering agreements with third parties regarding the license or
other use of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions. Effective
intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which
our products and services are distributed, deployed, or made available. We seek
to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets. The secrecy
could be compromised by third parties, or intentionally or accidentally by our
employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting
from those trade secrets. Any significant impairment of our intellectual
property rights, or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

We are, and may in
the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly
to defend, could require us to pay damages, and could limit our ability to use
certain technologies in the future.

Litigation based on allegations of infringement or
other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who
rely heavily on intellectual property rights. Our reliance on intellectual
property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have
implemented our VB


auction-style sales technologies across
our business and abandoned live auctions. As we face increasing competition,
the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. In June 2005,
a competitor filed a patent infringement claim against us relating to our VB


technologies.
This litigation and any other intellectual property claims, whether with or
without merit, can be time-consuming, expensive to litigate and settle, and can
divert management resources and attention from our core business. An adverse
determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering
our products and services in the manner currently conducted. We may also have
to pay damages or seek a license for the technology, which may not be available
on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating
expenses, if it is available for us to license at all. We could also be
required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require
significant effort and expense.

New accounting
pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require the
Company to make adjustments in our accounting policies that could adversely
affect our financial statements.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, or other accounting organizations or governmental entities issue
new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that
sometimes require us to change our accounting policies and procedures. To date,
we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had an adverse
effect on our financial condition or results of operations, but future
pronouncements or interpretations could require us to change our policies or
procedures. Moreover, we continually review our critical accounting policies in
light of the accounting literature and changes in our operations.


Government
regulation of the salvage vehicle sales and auction industry may impair our
operations, increase our costs of doing business and create potential
liability.

Participants in the salvage vehicle sales and auction industry
are subject to, and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a
variety of U.S. or Canadian, federal, state, provincial and local governmental,
regulatory and administrative rules, regulations, land use ordinances,
licensure requirements and procedures, including those governing vehicle
registration, the environment, zoning and land use. Failure to comply with
present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing
regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of
penalties and other liabilities. At various times, we may be involved in
disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development and/or
operation of our business facilities. We believe that we are in compliance in
all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements. We may be
subject to similar types of regulations by federal, provincial, state, and
local governmental agencies in new markets. In addition, new regulatory
requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost
of opening new facilities, may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may
decrease demand for our vehicles.

The operation of
our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks, which could adversely
affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations are subject to federal, state,
provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the
environment. In the salvage vehicle sales industry, large numbers of wrecked
vehicles are stored at storage facilities and, during that time, spills of
fuel, motor oil and other fluids may occur, resulting in soil, surface water or
groundwater contamination. Environmental issues resulting from fuel spills, oil
spillage, or similar problems are also present at our public sales facilities.
In addition, certain of our facilities generate and/or store petroleum products
and other hazardous materials, including waste solvents and used oil. We could
incur substantial expenditures for preventative, investigative or remedial action
and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations, contamination by
previous users of certain of our acquired facilities, or the disposal of our
waste at off-site locations. Environmental laws and regulations could become
more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our
operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future. Although we
have obtained indemnification for pre-existing environmental liabilities from
many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities, there
can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate. Any such
expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition.

If we experience
problems with our providers of fleet operations, our business could be harmed.

We rely upon independent subhaulers to pick up and
deliver vehicles to and from our storage facilities. Our failure to pick up and
deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and
brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, an
increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent
subhaulers, which may significantly increase our cost. These costs may not be
passed on to our sellers or buyers.

We are partially
self-insured for certain losses.

We are partially self-insured for certain losses
related to general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability. Our
liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of
the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is
established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates.
While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently
available, if actual trends, including the severity of claims and medical cost
inflation, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be
impacted. Further, we rely on independent actuaries to assist us in
establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated
with these self-insured exposures. If these actuaries provide guidance based on
erroneous assumptions, use models


mathematically flawed or
otherwise provide advice that is inaccurate or unrepresentative, then it could
have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

Our executive
officers, directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock
and their interests may differ from other shareholders.

Our executive officers, directors and their affiliates
beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 23% of our common stock as of
July 31, 2005. If they were to act together, these shareholders would have
significant influence over most matters requiring approval by shareholders,
including the election of directors, any amendments to our articles of
incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions, including
potential merger or acquisition transactions. In addition, without the consent
of these shareholders, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into
transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors. These
shareholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other
investors.

We have a
shareholder rights plan, or poison pill, which could affect the price of our
common stock and make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to purchase a
large portion of our securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest,
or to acquire us.

In March 2003, our board of directors adopted a
shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill. The poison pill may
discourage, delay, or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of
our securities, initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, or acquiring us
through an acquisition, merger, or similar transaction. Such an acquirer could
be prevented from consummating one of these transactions even if our
shareholders might receive a premium for their shares over then-current market
prices.

If we lose key
management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our
business, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our
objectives.

Our future success depends in large part upon the
leadership and performance of our executive management team, all of whom are
employed on an at-will basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not
to compete. If we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or
key employees, in particular Willis J. Johnson, our Chief Executive Officer,
and A. Jayson Adair, our President, or if one or more of them decides to join a
competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be
able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives.

Compliance with new
rules and regulations concerning corporate governance may be costly and
time consuming.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley, requires, among other things, that companies adopt new
corporate governance measures, imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure
requirements, sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for
board and audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal
penalties for companies, their chief executive officers and chief financial
officers for securities law violations. In addition, the Nasdaq National
Market, on which our common stock is traded, has adopted additional
comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance.
These laws, rules and regulations will increase the scope, complexity and
cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which
could harm our results of operations and divert management’s attention from
business operations. These new rules and regulations may also make it more
difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability
insurance and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified
members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit
committee.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters
are located in Fairfield, California. This facility consists of approximately
100,000 square feet of office space owned by Copart. We also own or lease an
additional 117 operating facilities in the United States and Canada located in
California, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Washington, Oregon, Georgia,
Missouri, New York, Connecticut, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Mississippi,
North Carolina, Indiana, Arizona, Louisiana, Utah, Nevada, Alabama, South

believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements
and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to
accommodate any expansion of operations and additional offices. After the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2005 we opened facilities in Hawaii and
Nebraska increasing the number of states we operate in to 44.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved in litigation and damage claims
arising in the ordinary course of business, such as actions related to
injuries, property damage, handling or disposal of vehicles and patent
infringement. We are also involved in various governmental and administrative
proceedings primarily relating to licensing and operation of our business. Among
this litigation is a lawsuit filed by Ciano Dessources on May 21, 2003 in
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Superior Court Department against Copart of
Connecticut, Inc. and Copart, Inc. which purports to be a class
action on behalf of persons whose vehicles were disposed of by us as abandoned
vehicles, which the named plaintiff contends were disposed of without complying
with state laws.

Relief sought included class certification,
declaratory, remedial and/or injunctive relief, including the ordering of a
compliance program that will essentially protect consumers, as well as damages,
fees, and costs. Copart’s Motion for Summary Judgment was granted on December 8,
2004, dismissing the class claim element of the lawsuit. However this dismissal
may be reconsidered, and may also be appealed once the remaining individual
claims of the named plaintiff are adjudicated.

On June 10, 2005, Manheim Services Corp. filed
suit against Copart, Inc. in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, alleging infringement of
Manheim’s assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,774,873. Relief sought included a
patent infringement judgment, an injunction prohibiting Copart from using any
infringing product or service (including VB


),
damages, fees, costs and expenses. On August 3, 2005, Copart denied
the claim and asserted counterclaims based on violations of antitrust laws and
common-law tortious interference. No trial date has yet been set.

On September 16, 2005, Richard M. Gray filed suit
against Copart  and A. Safrin, in the
State Court for the County of Chatham, State of Georgia, alleging a class
action for unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by Copart, and
related claims. Relief sought included class certification, damages, fees,
costs and expenses. Copart intends to vigorously defend the suit.

We provide for costs
relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future
results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on
future results of operations, the amount and timing of the resolution of such matters.
We believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the amount of
the liabilities associated with these claims, if any, cannot be determined with
certainty.

Dividend Policies

We have not paid a cash dividend since becoming a
public company in 1994. We currently intend to retain any earnings for use in
our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable
future.

We expect to continue to
use cash flows from operations to finance our working capital needs and to
develop and grow our business. In addition to our stock repurchase, we are
considering a variety of alternative potential uses for our remaining cash
balances and our cash flow from operations. These alternative potential uses
include additional stock repurchases, the payment of dividends and
acquisitions.

Stock Repurchase

In February 2003, the
Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 9
million shares of its Common Stock. The repurchases may be effected through
solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions. No time limit has been placed on the duration of the
share repurchase program. The repurchases will be made at such times and in
such amounts as Copart deems appropriate and may be discontinued at any time.
During fiscal 2005, the Company did not repurchase any shares. For the year ended
July 31, 2004, the Company repurchased a total of 977,100 shares at a
weighted average price of $10.97 per share. The total number of shares
repurchased under the program is approximately 3.7 million, leaving
approximately 5.3 million available under the repurchase program.

Issuances
of Unregistered Securities

There were no issuances of
unregistered securities in the quarter ended July 31, 2005.

Overview

We provide vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance
companies, with a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles
over the Internet through our Virtual Bidding Second Generation (“VB


”) Internet auction-style sales technology. We sell
principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used
vehicle dealers and exporters. Salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles
deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes or are recovered stolen
vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already
been made. We offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite
each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and
processing costs. We generate revenues primarily from fees paid by vehicle
suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as
towing and storage.

We process salvage vehicles principally on a
consignment method, on either the Percentage Incentive Program (“PIP”) or on a
fixed fee consignment basis. Using either consignment method, only the fees
associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue.

For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, approximately 68%, 65% and 67% of the vehicles we sold, respectively,
were processed under PIP. We attempt to convert vehicle supplier agreements at
acquired operations to PIP, which typically results in higher net returns to
vehicle suppliers and higher fees to us than standard fixed fee consignment
programs. Those vehicles not sold under the PIP program were processed under
fixed fee agreements.

Due to a number of factors, including the timing and
size of new acquisitions, market conditions, and acceptance of PIP by vehicle
suppliers, the percentage of vehicles processed under these programs in future
periods may vary.

Our revenues consist of salvage fees charged to
vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers, transportation revenue and purchased
vehicle revenues. Salvage fees from vehicle suppliers include sales fees under
PIP agreements and fixed fee programs where we charge for title processing,
special preparation, storage and selling. Salvage fees also include fees
charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles, storage and annual
registration. Transportation revenue includes charges to suppliers for towing
vehicles under fixed fee contracts. Transportation revenue also includes towing
charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles.


Purchased vehicle revenues
are comprised of the price that buyers paid at our sales for vehicles processed
that we own.

Costs attributable to yard and fleet expenses consist
primarily of operating personnel (which includes yard management, clerical and
yard employees), rent, contract vehicle towing, insurance, fuel, fleet
maintenance and repair, and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts.
Costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of
executive management, accounting, data processing, sales personnel, human resources,
professional fees, research and development and marketing expenses.

During fiscal 2004, we converted all of our salvage
vehicle storage and sales facilities to an Internet based auction-style model
using our VB


Internet sales technology. This second
generation technology combines two bidding processes. An open Preliminary
Bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the
storage facility during the three preview days or over the Internet. To improve
the effectiveness of bidding, the VB


system lets a buyer see the current high bid
on the vehicle they want to purchase. The preliminary bidding phase is an open
sales format. Buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a
vehicle and BID4U will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf.
Preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an Internet-only
virtual sale. BID4U will represent the high preliminary bidder at the
Internet-only virtual sale. This feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid
against each other and the high preliminary bidder. The bidders enter bids via
the Internet in a real time format. BID4U submits bids for the high preliminary
bidder, up to their maximum bid. When bidding stops, a countdown is initiated.
If no bids are received during the countdown, the vehicle sells to the highest
bidder. VB


opens our sales process to registered buyers
anywhere in the world who have Internet access.

We believe the implementation of VB


across our salvage
operations has increased the pool of available buyers for each sale and the
added competition has increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for
salvage from us. It has also improved the efficiency of our operations. For
fiscal 2005, sales of vehicles to buyers outside the state where the vehicle is
located accounted for 46% of total vehicles sold; 25% of salvage vehicles were
sold to out of state buyers and 21% were sold to buyers out of country.

The period-to-period
comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially
affected by business acquisitions, new openings, weather and product
introductions during such periods.

Acquisitions and New Operations

We have experienced significant growth as we have
acquired twelve vehicle storage facilities and established eleven new
facilities since the beginning of fiscal 2003. All of these acquisitions have
been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.

As part of our overall expansion strategy of offering
integrated service to vehicle suppliers, we anticipate acquiring and developing
facilities in new regions, as well as the regions currently served by our
facilities. As part of this strategy, in fiscal 2005 we acquired new facilities
in or near Lexington, Kentucky and Columbia, Missouri and opened new facilities
in Strongsville, Ohio; Ocala, Florida; Knoxville, Tennessee; Loganville,
Georgia; Spokane, Washington; Tallahassee, Florida and Hialeah, Florida. In
fiscal 2004 we acquired new facilities in or near Eugene, Oregon; Cleveland,
Ohio and Anchorage, Alaska and opened new facilities in or near Toronto, Canada
and Helena, Montana. In fiscal 2003, we acquired new facilities in or near
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Reno, Nevada and Richmond, Virginia and opened new
facilities in or near Springfield, Missouri; Corpus Christi, Texas; Ft. Pierce,
Florida; Rancho Cucamonga, California; Richmond, Virginia and Albany, New York.
We believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we
have 117 facilities located in North America and are able to provide national
coverage for our suppliers.


We seek to increase
revenues and profitability by, among other things, (i) acquiring and
developing new salvage vehicle storage facilities in key markets, (ii) pursuing
national and regional vehicle supply agreements, (iii) expanding our
service offerings to suppliers and buyers, (iv) increasing revenue and
profitability at our public automobile sales facilities and (v) expanding
the application of VB


into new markets. In addition, we implement
our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost
efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational
procedures, integrating our management information systems and redeploying
personnel, when necessary.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our
estimates, including those related to vehicle pooling costs, allowance for
doubtful accounts, goodwill, income taxes, long-lived assets and self insured
liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Management has discussed
the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our
disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this
annual report on Form 10-K. Our significant accounting policies are
described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2005.
The following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates used
in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue Recognition

We provide a portfolio of
services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a
vehicle from seller to buyer. These services include the ability to use our
internet sales technology and vehicle delivery, loading, title processing,
preparation and storage. We evaluate multiple-element arrangements relative to
our buyer and seller agreements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

(EITF 00-21), which addresses accounting for multiple-element arrangements, and
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104

Revenue Recognition

(SAB104), which addresses revenue recognition
for units of accounting.

The services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve
disposing of a vehicle on the seller's behalf and under most of our current
contracts, collecting the proceeds from the buyer. We are not entitled to any
such seller fees until we have collected the sales proceeds from the buyer for
the seller and, accordingly, we recognize revenue for seller services after
service delivery and cash collection.

In certain cases, seller fees are not contingent upon
collection of the seller proceeds from the buyer. However, we determined that
we are not able to separate the services into separate units of accounting
because we do not have fair value for undelivered items. As a result, we do not
recognize seller fees until the final seller service has been delivered, which
occurs upon collection of the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller.

We provide a number of services to the buyer of the
vehicle, charging a separate fee for each service. Each of these services has
been assessed under the criteria of EITF 00-21 to determine whether we
have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a
multi-element arrangement. We have concluded that the auction service and the
post-auction services are separate units of accounting. The fees for the
auction service are recognized upon completion of the auction, and the fees for
the post-auction services are recognized upon successful completion of those
services using the residual method.


We also charge buyers an annual registration fee for
the right to participate in our vehicle sales program, which is recognized
ratably over the term of the arrangement, and relist and late-payment fees
which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the buyer. No provision for
returns has been established, as all sales are final with no right of return,
although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of non-performance by our sellers.

Vehicle Pooling Costs

We defer, in vehicle
pooling costs, certain yard and fleet expenses associated with vehicles
consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date. We
quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of
vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period, the number
of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard and fleet
expenses of the period. The primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain
facility costs, labor, transportation, and vehicle processing. If our
allocation factors change, then yard and fleet expenses could increase or
decrease correspondingly in the future. These costs are expensed as vehicles
are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance
for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from
disputed amounts billed to suppliers or buyers and the inability of our
suppliers or buyers to make required payments. If billing disputes exceed
expectations and/or if the financial condition of our suppliers or buyers were
to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required.

Valuation
of Goodwill and Intangibles

We evaluate separately the
impairment of goodwill of our salvage and our public sales operating segments,
annually by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying
value. In prior years, we evaluated impairment of goodwill at the facility
level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.
During fiscal 2004, when we centralized the sales process with the implementation
of VB


, we determined the appropriate
level for testing for impairment was at the salvage and public sales levels.
Under this accounting policy, we have not recognized any charges for the
impairment of goodwill in previous years or the current year. Future adverse
changes in market conditions or poor operating results of an operating segment
could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment,
thereby requiring further impairment charges in the future.

Deferred Tax Assets

We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax
assets on an ongoing basis. Generally accepted accounting principles require
the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors when determining
the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets. Our
ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate
future taxable income. Accordingly, we have established a valuation allowance
when, in certain taxable jurisdictions, the utilization of the tax asset is
uncertain. Additional timing differences and future tax losses may occur which
could warrant a need for establishing additional valuation allowances or reserves
against certain deferred tax assets.

We are also required to estimate income tax provisions
and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions. Such
estimates involve significant interpretations of regulations and are inherently
very complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions
may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year.


Long-lived Asset Valuation

We evaluate long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the
carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows
change in the future, we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an
asset.

Retained Insurance Liabilities

We are partially
self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers’
compensation and auto liability. Our liability represents an estimate of the
ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated
liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of
historical data and actuarial estimates. While we believe these estimates are
reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends,
including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation, differ from our
estimates, our results of operations could be impacted.

Results of Operations

The
following table sets forth for the periods indicated below, certain information
derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of
revenues. There can be no assurance that any trend in operating results will
continue in the future.


Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004

Revenues were approximately $457.1 million during
fiscal 2005, an increase of approximately $56.3 million, or 14%, over
fiscal 2004. The increase was due primarily to increased vehicle sales volume,
on which fees are generated and higher fees resulting from increased sales
proceeds per vehicle.  The increase in
gross proceeds per vehicle (the gross sales price of the vehicle) yields higher
revenue per car as buyer fees and certain fees, including those sold under the
PIP program, are based on the gross proceeds per vehicle and generally increase
as gross proceeds per vehicle grow. We believe the increase in proceeds per
vehicle was the result of the introduction of Virtual Bidding Second Generation
“VB


” as more buyers are able to
participate in the sales. Existing facilities contributed approximately $51.7
million of the revenue growth and new facilities in or near Strongsville, Ohio;
Ocala, Florida; Knoxville, Tennessee; Lexington, Kentucky; Loganville, Georgia;
Spokane, Washington; Tallahassee, Florida; Hialeah, Florida and Columbia,
Missouri contributed approximately $4.6 million of new revenue.

Historically, we recorded revenue for most seller and
buyer fees upon completion of a sale. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005,
we recorded an immaterial correction of an error to account for our services in
accordance with the policy above; the effect of which was to reduce revenue,
net income and diluted earnings per share by $4.4 million, $1.5 million
and $0.01, respectively for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31,
2005.

Yard and fleet expenses were approximately $253.3
million during fiscal 2005, an increase of approximately $17.5 million, or 7%,
over fiscal 2004. The increase in yard and fleet expenses was due principally
to the cost of handling increased volume at existing operations and the costs
of new facilities. Approximately $4.4 million of the increase was the result of
the acquisition and opening of new facilities. Yard and fleet expenses from
existing facilities, grew by approximately $13.1 million, or 6%. Yard and fleet
expenses decreased to 55% of revenues during fiscal 2005, as compared to 59% of
revenues during fiscal 2004 due in part to the fixed cost nature of our
business. Yard and fleet expenses in fiscal 2004 included a net adjustment to
insurance reserves and sales taxes that decreased this expense by $3.6 million.

General and administrative expenses were approximately
$47.0 million during fiscal 2005, an increase of approximately $6.8 million, or
17%, over fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to increases in software
development cost, technology hardware leasing cost, and IT payroll costs, all
directly associated with the development and deployment of VB


. In addition, the company saw increases in the cost of
professional services, impacted by Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and increased
payroll and benefit costs associated with expanded support headcount. General
and administrative expenses remained relatively flat as a percentage of
revenues during fiscal 2005 and 2004.

Total other income was approximately $8.2 million
during fiscal 2005, an increase of approximately $2.7 million, or 48% from
fiscal 2004. The increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income
of approximately $3.4 million due to higher interest rates and a higher cash
balance. Gain on the sale of fleet equipment decreased approximately $1.4
million as we sold the majority of the fleet in fiscal 2004 in connection with
our decision to subcontract towing services. Other income, which consists
primarily of rental income, increased approximately $0.7 million as we
continued the rental of primarily unutilized areas within our facilities.

Our effective combined federal, state and local income
tax rate for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was approximately 38% and 39%,
respectively

. The
decrease in rate is attributable to an overall lower state tax rate, as we made
certain revisions to our transfer pricing methodology and the beneficial impact
of the growth in interest income which is predominantly federal tax exempt. We
do not expect significant changes to our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006.

Due to the foregoing
factors, we realized net income of approximately $102.1 million for fiscal
2005, compared to net income of approximately $79.2 million for fiscal 2004.


Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003

Revenues were approximately $400.8 million during
fiscal 2004, an increase of approximately $53.4 million, or 15%, over fiscal
2003. The increase was due primarily to increased salvage vehicle volume, new
service revenue and higher fees resulting from increased sales proceeds per
vehicle. We believe the increase in proceeds per vehicle was the result of the
introduction of Virtual Bidding Second Generation “VB


” as more buyers are able to participate in the sales.
Existing facilities contributed approximately $52.0 million of new revenue and
new facilities in or near Toronto, Canada; Eugene, Oregon; Helena, Montana;
Cleveland, Ohio and Anchorage, Alaska contributed approximately $1.4 million of
new revenue.

Yard and fleet expenses were approximately $235.8
million during fiscal 2004, an increase of approximately $11.4 million, or 5%,
over fiscal 2003. Included in yard and fleet expense is a net adjustment to
insurance reserves that decreased this expense by $3.6 million. The increase in
yard and fleet expenses was due principally to the cost of handling increased
volume at existing operations and the costs of new facilities. Approximately
$2.1 million of the increase was the result of the acquisition and opening of
new facilities. Depreciation and amortization expense associated with yard
activities increased approximately $5.0 million over fiscal 2003. This increase
was due primarily to depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures and
covenants not to compete and depreciation of acquired assets resulting from the
acquisition of new storage and sales facilities. Yard and fleet expenses
decreased to 59% of revenues during fiscal 2004, as compared to 65% of revenues
during fiscal 2003. Yard and fleet expenses decreased as a percentage of
revenue and was due in part to the fixed cost nature of our business.

General and administrative expenses were approximately
$40.2 million during fiscal 2004, an increase of approximately $8.0 million, or
25%, over fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to increases in software
development cost, technology hardware leasing cost, and IT payroll costs, all
directly associated with the development and deployment of VB


. In addition, the company saw increases in the cost of
professional services, impacted by Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and increased
payroll and benefit costs associated with expanded support headcount. General
and administrative expenses increased to 10% of revenues during fiscal 2004, as
compared to 9% of revenues during fiscal 2003.

Total other income was approximately $5.5 million
during fiscal 2004, an increase of approximately $2.1 million, or 62% from
fiscal 2003. Gain on sale of fleet equipment represents the gain on the sale of
602 vehicles. The sale of the equipment is associated with our decision to
replace company owned trucks with subhaulers for towing services. Interest
income decreased approximately $0.1 million due to lower interest rates during
the first nine months of the fiscal year. Other income, which consists
primarily of rental income, increased approximately $1.1 million as we rented
several under-utilized facilities.

Our effective combined federal, state and local income
tax rate for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 was approximately 39%.

Due to the foregoing
factors, we realized net income of approximately $79.2 million for fiscal 2004,
compared to net income of approximately $57.2 million for fiscal 2003.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, we have financed our growth through cash
generated from operations, public offerings of common stock, equity issued in
conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing. Cash and cash
equivalents increased by approximately $246.8 million and $61.6 million in
fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively, mainly as a result of the conversion of
$172.6 million in short-term investments in fiscal 2005 and changes
in operating activities. Our liquidity and capital resources have not been
materially affected by inflation. During the winter months, most of our
facilities process 10% to 30% more vehicles than at other times of the year.
This seasonal volume growth requires increased cash to pay out advances and
handling costs of the additional business.


As of July 31, 2005, we had working capital of
approximately $296.0 million, including cash and cash equivalents of
approximately $252.5 million.

We invest substantially all of
our cash balances in AAA rated auction rate securities.  Auction rate securities are principally
variable rate securities tied to short-term interest rates with maturities on
the face of the securities in excess of 90 days. Auction rate securities have
interest rate resets through a modified Dutch auction, at predetermined
short-term intervals, usually every 7, 28 or 35 days. They trade at par and are
callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of the issuer.
Interest paid during a given period is based upon the interest rate determined
during the prior auction. Although these instruments are issued and rated as
long-term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term securities
because of the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset. These auction
rate securities were converted to cash prior to the end of the current fiscal
year and were held in money market accounts. Our primary source of cash is from
the collection of sellers’ fees and buyers’ fees from the sale of salvage
vehicles.

We believe that our
currently available cash, cash generated from operations and borrowing
availability under our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our
operating and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.
However, if we experience significant growth in the future, we may be required
to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by
operating activities increased by $20.9 million from fiscal 2004 to $136.0
million in fiscal 2005, due to the profitability of the company offset by
routine changes in working capital.

Investing Activities

During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2005, we
purchased approximately $755.4 million in short-term investments. These purchases
were offset by the sale of $928.0 million of short-term investments. We
typically invest our cash in auction rate notes with ratings of AAA, which were
converted to cash prior to the end of the fiscal year.

Capital expenditures (excluding those associated with
fixed assets attributable to acquisitions) were approximately $66.3 million,
$64.6 million and $70.7 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Our capital expenditures have related primarily to opening and improving
facilities and acquiring yard equipment. In addition, in fiscal 2004, the
company sold most of its transportation fleet as it moved to outsource this
function. Sale of fleet equipment generated approximately $19.0 million in
gross proceeds.

During the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2005, we used cash for the acquisition of operations in
Lexington, Kentucky and Columbia, Missouri, which had an aggregate cash cost of
approximately $4.5 million. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004, we
used cash for the acquisition of operations in Eugene, Oregon; Cleveland, Ohio
and Anchorage, Alaska, which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately $4.7
million. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2003, we used cash for the
acquisition of operations in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania; Reno, Nevada and
Richmond, Virginia, which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately $6.6
million.

Financing Activities

In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, we generated
approximately $1.8 million, $5.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively,
through the exercise of stock options.

In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, we generated
approximately $1.4 million, $1.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively,
through the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase program.

In February 2003, the
Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 9
million shares of its Common Stock. The repurchases may be effected through
solicited or unsolicited


transactions
in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. No time limit has
been placed on the duration of the share repurchase program. The repurchases
will be made at such times and in such amounts, as we deem appropriate and may
be discontinued at any time. For the year ended July 31, 2005, we did not
repurchase any shares. As of July 31, 2005, we repurchased a total of
3,672,300 shares at a weighted average price of $8.49. For the year ended July 31,
2004, we repurchased a total of 977,100 shares at a weighted average price of
$10.97 per share. We accounted for the repurchase of our Common Stock by
charging Common Stock for $31.2 million. Through October 14, 2005, we have
not repurchased any shares.

Credit Facilities

On February 23, 2001,
we entered into a credit facility with our existing banking syndicate. The
facility provided by Wells Fargo Bank, Fleet National Bank and U.S. Bank
National Association consists of an unsecured revolving reducing line of credit
in the amount of $10.6 million that matures in 2006. As of July 31, 2005,
we had available $0.1 million under this facility, after taking into account
$10.5 million of outstanding letters of credit. We are subject to customary
covenants, including the following financial covenants: 1) ratio of funded debt
to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); 2)
profitable operation; 3) leverage ratio and 4) interest coverage ratio. We are
in compliance with all covenants at July 31, 2005.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 151, “

Inventory Costs, an amendment
of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4

”. This statement amends the guidance
in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, “

Inventory
Pricing

,” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). SFAS
No. 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges
regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal.” In addition,
this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the
costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 shall be applied prospectively and are
effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2005, with earlier application permitted for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued.
The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not expected to have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.


In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004),

“Share-Based Payment”

(“SFAS
123R”), which replaces SFAS 123. The accounting required by SFAS 123R is
similar to that of SFAS 123; however, the choice between recognizing the fair
value of stock options in the income statement or disclosing the pro forma
income statement effect of the fair value of stock options in the notes to the
financial statements allowed under SFAS 123 has been eliminated in SFAS 123R.
SFAS 123R is effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005,
and early adoption is permitted. Management intends to use the modified
prospective transition method to adopt SFAS 123R beginning in fiscal 2006 and
expects that the implementation of SFAS 123R will increase our stock-based
compensation expense in fiscal 2006.

In May 2005, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections—a
replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3”. This
Statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes,” and FASB
Statement No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements,” and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting
of a change in accounting principle. This Statement applies to all voluntary
changes in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an
accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does
not include specific transition provisions. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. Management currently believes that adoption of
the provisions of SFAS No. 154 will not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our principal exposures to financial market risk are
interest rate and foreign currency risk. Our exposure to market risk for
changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of
marketable securities.

As
of July 31, 2005, our cash and
cash equivalents consisted primarily of funds invested in money market
accounts, which bear interest at a variable rate. During the course of the year
we invested substantially all of our cash balances in AAA rated auction rate
securities, which also bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average
maturity and nature of the Company’s investment portfolio, we believe a sudden
change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our
investment portfolio. As the interest rates on a material portion of our cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments are variable, a change in interest
rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along
with cash flows, but would not materially impact the fair market value of the
related underlying instruments.

Our exposure to foreign
currency risks relates to our operations in Canada, which have not been
significant. We do not hedge our exposure to the Canadian dollar. We do not use
derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, or “Disclosure
Controls,” as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K.
This evaluation, or “Controls Evaluation” was performed under the supervision
and with the participation of management, including our Chairman of the Board,
Chief Executive Officer and Director (our “CEO”) and our Senior Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer (our “CFO”). Disclosure Controls are controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), such as this annual report, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Our Disclosure Controls include some, but not
all, components of our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal
control over financial reporting was also separately evaluated as of the end of
the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K in connection
with Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting which is
set forth below.

Based upon the Controls
Evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period
covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, our Disclosure Controls
were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
Exchange Act reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including
the CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and
that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining internal control over financial reporting (as such item is defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Management assessed our internal control over
financial reporting as of July 31, 2005, the end of our fiscal year.
Management based its assessment on criteria established in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Management’s assessment included evaluation
of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial
reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall
control environment. This assessment is supported by testing and monitoring
performed by our Finance department.

Based on our assessment, management has concluded that
our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of
the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
reporting purposes


in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of management’s
assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Our independent registered
public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, audited management’s assessment of internal
control over financial reporting and also independently assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. KPMG LLP has
issued an attestation report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including
our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls or our internal
control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A
control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will
be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Copart, Inc. have
been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of
simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of
compliance with associated policies or procedures. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or
fraud may occur and not be detected.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have not been any
changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act), during the most
recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Copart, Inc.:

We
have audited management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting as part of Item 9(a) of this Form 10-K,
that Copart, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of July 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Copart, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management’s assessment that Copart, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2005,
is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Also, in our opinion, Copart, Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31,
2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Copart, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended July 31, 2005, and our report dated October 14, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Copart, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Copart, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 31, 2005 and 2004,
and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended July 31, 2005. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Copart, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 31, 2005 and
2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended July 31, 2005, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Copart, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over
financial reporting as of July 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO), and our report dated October 14, 2005, expressed an unqualified
opinion on management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal
control over financial reporting.

(1) Business
and Basis of Presentation

Description of Business

Copart, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (“the Company”) provide vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance
companies, with a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles
over the Internet through our Virtual Bidding Second Generation (“VB


”)
Internet auction-style sales technology. The Company sells principally to
licensed vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle
dealers and exporters. Salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a
total loss for insurance or business purposes or are recovered stolen vehicles
for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made.
The Company offers vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite
each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and
processing costs.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries.
Significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.

(2)  Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies and Practices

Revenue Recognition

The Company provides a portfolio of services to its
sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from
seller to buyer. These services include the ability to use its internet sales
technology and vehicle delivery, loading, title processing, preparation and
storage. The Company evaluates multiple-element arrangements relative to our
buyer and seller agreements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables

(EITF 00-21), which addresses accounting for
multiple-element arrangements, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104

Revenue Recognition

(SAB104), which
addresses revenue recognition for units of accounting.

The services the Company provides to the seller of a
vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller's behalf and under most of
our current contracts, collecting the proceeds from the buyer. The Company is
not entitled to any seller fees until the Company has collected the sales
proceeds from the buyer for the seller and, accordingly, the Company recognizes
revenue for seller services after service delivery and cash collection.

In certain cases, seller fees are not contingent upon
collection of the seller proceeds from the buyer. However, the Company
determined that it is not able to separate the services into separate units of
accounting because the Company does not have fair value for undelivered items. As
a result, the Company does not recognize seller fees until the final seller
service has been delivered, which occurs upon collection of the sales proceeds
from the buyer for the seller.

The Company provides
a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle, charging a separate fee for
each service. Each of these services has been assessed under the criteria of
EITF 00-21 to determine whether the Company has met the requirements to
separate them into units of accounting within a multi-element arrangement. The
Company has concluded that the auction service and the post-auction services
are separate units of accounting. The fees for the auction service are
recognized upon completion of the

auction, and the fees for
the post-auction services are recognized upon successful completion of those
services using the residual method.

The Company also charges buyers an annual registration
fee for the right to participate in its vehicle sales program, which is
recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, and relist and
late-payment fees which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the buyer. No
provision for returns has been established, as all sales are final with no
right of return, although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of
non-performance by our sellers.

Historically, the Company recorded revenue for most
seller and buyer fees upon completion of a sale. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005, we recorded an immaterial correction of an error to account for our
services in accordance with the policy above; the effect of which was to reduce
revenue, net income and diluted earnings per share by $4.4 million, $1.5 million
and $0.01, respectively for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31,
2005.

Yard and Fleet Expenses

Yard and fleet expenses
consist primarily of operating personnel (which includes yard management,
clerical and yard employees), rent, contract vehicle towing, insurance, fuel
and equipment maintenance and repair.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative
expenses consist primarily of executive, accounting and data processing, sales
personnel, professional fees, software and product development and marketing
expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all
highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.

Vehicle Pooling Costs

The Company capitalizes
vehicle pooling costs which consist of certain labor, towing, facility, outside
services and other costs directly attributable to the gathering and processing
of vehicles prior to their sale. The Company calculates the amounts
attributable to vehicles sold and vehicles in storage on a quarterly basis. Vehicle
pooling costs are recognized as expenses in the period the vehicle is sold. The
Company continually evaluates and adjusts the components of vehicle pooling
costs as necessary.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable, which
consist primarily of advance charges due from insurance companies and the gross
sales price of the vehicle due from buyers, are recorded at the invoiced amount
and do not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses on earned fees resulting from the inability of
the Company’s customers to make payments based upon historical write-offs as a
percentage of net revenues and management’s review of outstanding accounts
receivable. Amounts due from customers are charged against the allowance for
doubtful accounts when management believes

Practices (Continued)

the
collectibility of the amount is unlikely. The Company does not have off-balance
sheet credit exposure related to its customers.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Leasehold improvements are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease terms or the useful
lives of the respective assets.

Depreciation is computed
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of: 3 to 7 years for
transportation and other equipment; 5 to 10 years for office furniture and
equipment; and 15 to 40 years or life of lease, whichever is shorter, for
buildings and leasehold improvements.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist
of covenants not to compete. Amortization is provided on the straight-line
basis over the life of the covenant, which ranges from 5 to 7 years.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The amounts recorded for
financial instruments in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which
include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value as of July 31,
2005 and 2004.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted
for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share
amounts were computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share amounts were computed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding plus dilutive potential common shares calculated for stock options
outstanding using the treasury stock method.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for its stock-based employee
compensation plans using the intrinsic-value-based method prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees”

(“APB 25”), and related
interpretations, as allowed under Financial Accounting Standards


COPART, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

July 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003

(2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and
Practices (Continued)

Board Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123,

“Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation”

(“SFAS 123”) as amended by SFAS No. 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition
and Disclosure”

(“ SFAS 148”). Accordingly, compensation cost is
measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the Company’s stock at the
date of the grant over the price the employee must pay to acquire the stock.
Options granted to consultants and other non-employees are accounted for at
fair value.

Pro forma information regarding net income and net
income per share is required by SFAS No. 123, and has been determined as
if the Company had accounted for options granted under its plans using the fair
value method. For these purposes, the fair value of options issued under the
plans was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following assumptions: no dividend yield, volatility factor of
the expected market price of the Company’s stock of 0.40, a forfeiture rate of
0.08, a weighted-average expected life of the options of five years and a
risk-free interest rate of 3.7%, 3.3% and 2.9% for 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The weighted average fair value of options granted were $5.13,
$3.57 and $2.93, for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For purposes of pro
forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to
expense over the options vesting period. The effects of applying SFAS No. 123
in this pro forma disclosure are not necessarily indicative of future results.

The
Company’s pro forma information related to option grants to employees as
calculated in accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS 148 is as follows:

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income
includes income adjusted for certain revenues, expenses, gains and losses that
are excluded from net income under generally accepted accounting principles.
Examples include foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains
and losses on certain derivatives. The Company had no items of other
comprehensive income in 2003. Therefore, net income as presented in the
consolidated statements of income equals comprehensive income for that year.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

July 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003

(2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and
Practices (Continued)

Segment Reporting

The Company has two
operating segments, salvage sales and public sales. The public sales segment
does not meet the quantitative criteria set out in SFAS 131 and is not
material, and as such, its information has not been separately disclosed.

Use of Estimates

Management of the Company
has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
to prepare these financial statements in conformity with accou

nting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the
useful life and carrying amount of property and equipment and intangibles;
deferred taxes and any associated valuation allowances; allowances for doubtful
accounts; vehicle pooling costs; the consideration of goodwill impairment; and
accrued self-insurance and other accrued liabilities. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Business Combinations and Goodwill

The Company accounts for business combinations and
goodwill according to SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” and SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” SFAS No. 141 requires that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and that
certain acquired intangible assets be recognized as assets apart from goodwill.
The adoption of SFAS No. 141 had no impact on the Company’s results of
operations or financial position. SFAS No. 142 provides that goodwill
should not be amortized but instead should be tested for impairment annually at
the reporting unit level. In prior years the Company evaluated impairment of
goodwill at the facility level by comparing the fair value of the reporting
unit to its carrying value. During fiscal 2004, when the Company centralized
the sales process with the implementation of VB


, the Company
determined the appropriate level for testing for impairment was at the salvage
and public sales levels. The Company’s annual impairment test was performed in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The results of this test indicated that
goodwill was not impaired.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the
carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which
the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value.

Advertising

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising expenses were $2.8 million, $2.0 million and $1.3 million in fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Reclassifications

Certain previous year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the current year presentation, including the reclassification of
auction rate securities (ARS) as short-term investments instead of cash and
equivalents in accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The Company reclassified $172.6 million of investments in ARS as of
July 31, 2004, that were previously included in cash and equivalents, to
short-term investments. The Company has included purchases and sales of ARS in
our statements of cash flows as a component of investing activities. These
reclassifications had no impact on our results of operations or changes in
shareholders’ equity, or cash flows.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards

In November 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “

Inventory
Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4

”. This statement
amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, “

Inventory Pricing

,” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts
of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material
(spoilage). SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be recognized as
current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so
abnormal.” In addition, this statement requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity
of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 shall be applied
prospectively and are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier application permitted
for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date this
Statement is issued. The Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.


COPART, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(2) Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices (Continued)

In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

“Share-Based Payment”

(“SFAS 123R”), which replaces SFAS
123. The accounting required by SFAS 123R is similar to that of SFAS 123;
however, the choice between recognizing the fair value of stock options in the
income statement or disclosing the pro forma income statement effect of the
fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements allowed
under SFAS 123 has been eliminated in SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R is effective for all
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, and early adoption is
permitted. Management intends to use the modified prospective transition method
to adopt SFAS 123R beginning in fiscal 2006 and expects that the implementation
of SFAS 123R will increase the Company’s stock-based compensation expense in
fiscal 2006.

In May 2005,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections—a
replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3”. This
Statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes,” and FASB
Statement No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements,” and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting
of a change in accounting principle. This Statement applies to all voluntary
changes in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an
accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does
not include specific transition provisions. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005.

(3)  Acquisitions

Fiscal 2005 Transactions

During
fiscal 2005, the Company made the following two acquisitions: Kentucky Auto
Salvage Pool, Inc. (“KASP”) of Lexington, Kentucky and Insurance Auctions
of Missouri, Inc. of Columbia, Missouri. The consideration paid for these acquisitions
consisted of $4.5 million in cash. The acquired net assets consisted of
accounts and advances receivable, vehicle pooling costs, fixed assets, land,
buildings, goodwill, and covenants not to compete. The acquisitions were
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the operating
results subsequent to the acquisition dates are included in the Company’s
consolidated statements of income. These new facilities contributed $0.7
million of revenues during fiscal 2005. The excess of the purchase price over
the fair market value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $3.7 million
has been recorded as goodwill. The Company estimates the entire goodwill
balance relating to these acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes. In
addition, the Company paid $0.3 million for covenants not to compete relating
to these acquisitions, which are being amortized over five to seven years. In
conjunction with the Lexington, Kentucky and Columbia, Missouri, acquisitions,
the Company entered into leases for the use of these facilities at fair value.

Fiscal 2004 Transactions

During
fiscal 2004, the Company made the following four acquisitions: Brasher’s
Northwest Auto Auction, Inc. of Eugene, Oregon; Spooner Enterprises, Inc.
d/b/a Insured Salvage Pool, of Reno, Nevada; Joe Horisk Salvage Pool Systems of
Ohio, of Cleveland, Ohio and Alaska Towing and Wrecking of Anchorage, Alaska.
The consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of $4.7 million in
cash. The acquired net assets consisted of accounts and advances receivable,
vehicle pooling costs, fixed assets, land, buildings, goodwill, and covenants
not to compete. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting, and the operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates
are included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. These new
facilities contributed $1.4 million of revenues during fiscal 2004. The excess
of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net identifiable assets
acquired of $3.6 million has been recorded as goodwill. The Company estimates
the entire goodwill


COPART, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(3)  Acquisitions

(Continued)

balance relating to these acquisitions will be
deductible for tax purposes. In addition, the Company paid $0.2 million for
covenants not to compete relating to these acquisitions, which are being
amortized over five years. In conjunction with the Eugene, Oregon; Reno, Nevada
and Anchorage, Alaska acquisitions, the Company entered into leases for the use
of these facilities at fair value.

Fiscal 2003 Transactions

During
fiscal 2003, the Company made the following three acquisitions: Greater
Pittsburgh Auto Auction, Inc. of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania; E.W.E.
Salvage Pool & Auto Auction, Inc. of Reno, Nevada and Richmond
Auto Auction of Virginia, Inc. of Richmond, Virginia. The consideration
paid for these acquisitions consisted of $6.6 million in cash. The acquired net
assets consisted of accounts and advances receivable, vehicle pooling costs,
fixed assets, land, buildings, goodwill, and covenants not to compete. The
acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and
the operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates are included in the
Company’s consolidated statements of income. These new facilities contributed
$5.1 million of revenues during fiscal 2003. The excess of the purchase price
over the fair market value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $5.8
million has been recorded as goodwill. The Company estimates the entire
goodwill balance relating to these acquisitions will be deductible for tax
purposes. In addition, the Company paid $0.4 million for covenants not to
compete relating to these acquisitions, which are being amortized over five to
seven years. In conjunction with the West Mifflin, Pennsylvania; Reno, Nevada
and Richmond, Virginia acquisitions, the Company entered into leases for the
use of these facilities at fair value.

Pro
forma financial information for the 2005 and 2004 acquisitions does not result
in a significant change from actual results.

(4) Short-term
Investments:

Short-term
investments consist of federal, state and municipal securities with readily
determinable fair market values and original maturities in excess of three
months. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as
short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable
securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current
operations. The Company’s investments are classified as available-for-sale and
accordingly are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
reported as a component of shareholders’ equity. Unrealized losses are charged
against income when a decline in the fair market value of an individual security
is determined to be other than temporary. The Company did not recognize any
realized or unrealized gains or losses on its investments for fiscal 2005,
2004, and 2003 as it invested exclusively in short-term auction rate
securities.

As
of July 31, 2005, the Company had no short-term investments as all
short-term investments, consisting principally of AAA rated auction rate
securities, were converted to cash prior to the end of the quarter.

Short-term investments consist of the following (in

(8)  Accounts Payable
and Accrued Liabilities

Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities consist of the following (in thousands):

The Company is partially
self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers’
compensation and auto liability. Accrued insurance liability represents an
estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date.
The estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon
analysis of historical data, including the severity of or frequency of claims,
actuarial estimates and is reviewed periodically by management to ensure that
the liability is appropriate. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the
Company reduced its accrual for self insured claims based upon new information
and analysis regarding the expected severity and frequency of claims; this
resulted in a $4.4 million reduction to yard and fleet expense. The Company
experienced a reduction in the severity and frequency of claims, which reduced
the ultimate cost of claims.

(9)  Long-Term Debt

On February 23, 2001,
the Company entered into a credit facility with our existing banking syndicate.
The facility provided by Wells Fargo Bank, Fleet National Bank and U.S. Bank
National Association consists of an unsecured revolving reducing line of credit
in the amount of $10.6 million that matures in

2006. As
of July 31, 2005, the Company had available $0.1 million under this
facility, after taking into account $10.5 million of outstanding letters of
credit. The Company is subject to customary covenants, including the following
financial covenants: 1) ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); 2) profitable operation; 3)
leverage ratio and 4) interest coverage ratio.

(10)  Shareholders’
Equity

In December 2001, the Company adopted the Copart, Inc.
2001 Stock Option Plan (“Plan”), presently covering an aggregate of 4.5 million
shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The Plan provides for the grant of
incentive stock options to employees and non-qualified stock options to
employees, officers, directors and consultants at prices not less than 100% and
85% of the fair market value for incentive and non-qualified stock options,
respectively, as determined by the Board of Directors at the grant date.
Incentive and non-qualified stock options may have terms of up to ten years and
vest over periods determined by the Board of Directors. Options generally vest
ratably over a five-year period. The Plan replaced the Company’s 1992 Stock
Option Plan (“1992 Plan”), which expired in August 2002.

The Company has authorized the issuance of 5 million
shares of preferred stock, no par value, none of which are issued or
outstanding at July 31, 2005.

The Copart, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
provides for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1.5 million shares of Common
Stock of the Company by employees pursuant to the terms of the ESPP. The number
of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the ESPP during each of fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003 was 68,633, 135,735 and 204,753, respectively.

In February 2003, the Company’s Board of
Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 9 million shares of its
Common Stock. The repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited
transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. No
time limit has been placed on the duration of the share repurchase program. The
repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts, as Copart deems
appropriate and may be discontinued at any time. During fiscal 2005, the
Company did not repurchase any shares. For the year ended July 31, 2004,
the Company repurchased a total of 977,100 shares at a weighted average price of
$10.97 per share.

In March 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors
adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan. Under the plan, the Company issued a
dividend of one right for each share of its common stock held by shareholders
of record as of the close of business on Friday, March 21, 2003.

The Company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets
is dependent on its ability to generate future taxable income. Accordingly, the
Company has established a valuation allowance in taxable jurisdictions where
the utilization of the tax assets are uncertain. Additional timing differences
and/or future tax losses may occur which could warrant a need for establishing additional
valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets.

The Company is under routine income tax audits in two
states for tax years between 1999 and 2003. Management believes that adequate
amounts have been provided for any adjustments that may ultimately result from
these examinations.

In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized
a tax benefit of $1.1 million, $1.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively,
upon the exercise of certain stock options which is reflected in shareholders’
equity.

2005 and 2004 was $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively, which is a net
increase of $0.3 million. There was no valuation allowance as of July 31,
2003.

The Company has a Canadian
net operating loss of approximately $1.3 million, most of which expires between
2010 and 2012. In addition the Company also has various state net operating
losses of $6.7 million, which expire between 2016 and 2025.

(14)  Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

The Company leases certain facilities under operating
leases and in some cases has either a right of first refusal to acquire or
option to purchase certain facilities at fair value. The Company recognizes
rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and has accrued for
rent expense incurred but not paid. Facilities rental expense for the fiscal
years ended July 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 aggregated $17.2 million, $18.1
million and $15.5 million, respectively.

Yard and fleet equipment rental expense for the fiscal
years ended July 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 aggregated approximately $4.0
million, $6.3 million and $10.2 million, respectively.

Noncancelable
future minimum lease payments under operating leases with initial or remaining
lease terms in excess of one year at July 31, 2005 are as follows (in
thousands):

Commitments

The Company had outstanding letters of credit of $10.5
million at July 31, 2005. These letters of credit secure certain insurance
obligations.

Contingencies

The Company is involved in litigation and damage
claims arising in the ordinary course of business, such as actions related to
injuries, property damage, handling or disposal of vehicles and patent
infringement. The Company is also involved in various governmental and
administrative proceedings primarily relating to licensing and operation of our
business. Among this litigation is a lawsuit filed by Ciano Dessources on May 21,
2003 in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Superior Court Department against
Copart of Connecticut, Inc. and Copart, Inc. which purports to be a
class action on behalf of persons whose vehicles were disposed of by the
Company as abandoned vehicles, which the named plaintiff contends were disposed
of without complying with state laws.

Relief sought included class
certification, declaratory, remedial and/or injunctive relief, including the
ordering of a compliance program that will essentially protect consumers, as
well as damages, fees, and costs. Copart’s Motion for Summary Judgment was
granted on December 8, 2004, dismissing the class claim element of the lawsuit.
However this dismissal may be reconsidered, and may also be appealed once the
remaining individual claims of the named plaintiff are adjudicated.

On June 10, 2005, Manheim Services Corp. filed
suit against Copart, Inc. in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, alleging infringement of
Manheim’s assigned


COPART, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(14)  Commitments and Contingencies

(Continued)

U.S. Patent No. 5,774,873.
Relief sought included a patent infringement judgment, an injunction
prohibiting the Company from using any infringing product or service (including
VB


), damages, fees, costs and expenses. On August 3, 2005,
the Company denied the claim and asserted counterclaims based on violations of
antitrust laws and common-law tortious interference. No trial date has yet been
set.

On September 16, 2005, Richard M. Gray filed suit
against Copart and A. Safrin, in the State Court for the County of Chatham,
State of Georgia, alleging a class action for unreasonable amounts claimed for
storage liens by the Company, and related claims. Relief sought included class
certification, damages, fees, costs and expenses.

The Company provides for
costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on the Company’s
future results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect
depends on future results of operations, the amount and timing of the
resolution of such matters. The Company believes that any ultimate liability
will not have a material effect on its financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. However, the amount of the liabilities associated
with these claims, if any, cannot be determined with certainty.

(15)  Related Party Transactions

The Company leases certain
of its facilities from officers and/or directors of the Company under various
lease agreements. Rental payments under these leases aggregated $0.5 million,
$0.5 million and $0.4 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively, and expire on various dates through 2009. The
Company leases certain of its facilities from other employees of the Company
under various lease agreements. Rental payments under these leases aggregated
$0.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the fiscal years ended July 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(16)  Employee Benefit Plan

The Company sponsors a 401(k) defined
contribution plan covering its eligible employees. The plan is available to all
employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and provides employees
with tax deferred salary deductions and alternative investment options. The
Company matches 10% of employee contributions up to 15% of employee salary
deferral. The Company recognized an expense of $0.2 million for each of the
years ended July 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 related to this plan.

(17)  Noncash Financing and Investing Activities

In fiscal 2005 and 2004,
the Company received 42,071 and 983 shares of common stock, respectively as
payment for the exercise of 95,106 and 9,000 shares of common stock under the
1992 Stock Option Plan, respectively. The Company retired these shares upon
receipt.
