PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Copart, Inc.
is a leading provider of salvage vehicle sales services in the United States.

We provide
vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance companies, with a full range of services
to process and sell salvage vehicles over the Internet through our Virtual
Bidding Second Generation (“VB


”) Internet auction-style sales
technology. We sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders,
repair licensees, used vehicle dealers and exporters. Salvage vehicles are either
damaged vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes or are
recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle
owner has already been made. We offer vehicle suppliers a full range of
services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and
minimize administrative and processing costs. We generate revenues primarily
from fees paid by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees
for services such as towing and storage.

We have grown
our salvage vehicle sales business through a combination of acquisitions and
the development of new facilities and also by increasing our buyer base and
implementing additional value-added services for both buyers and suppliers. For
fiscal year 2006, our revenues were approximately $528.6 million and our
operating income was approximately $171.6 million from continuing operations.
During the fiscal year ending July 31, 2006, we acquired seven salvage
vehicle storage facilities and opened four new salvage vehicle storage
facilities. We acquired storage sites located in Greenwood, Nebraska; Grand
Island, Nebraska; York Haven, Pennsylvania; Chambersburg, Pennsylvania;
Altoona, Pennsylvania; Fruitland, Maryland and Billings, Montana. We opened new
vehicle storage sites in Honolulu, Hawaii; Lansing, Michigan; Dover, Florida
and Jacksonville, Florida.

During fiscal
2004, we converted all of our salvage vehicle storage facilities to an Internet
based auction-style model using VB


. This second generation technology
combines two bidding processes. An open Preliminary Bidding feature allows a
buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage facility during
the three preview days or over the Internet. To improve the effectiveness of
bidding, the VB


system lets a buyer see the current high bid
on the vehicle they want to purchase. The preliminary bidding phase is an open
sales format. Buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a
vehicle and VB


’s
BID4U feature will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf. Preliminary
bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an Internet-only virtual sale.
BID4U will represent the high preliminary bidder at the Internet-only virtual
sale. This feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and
the high preliminary bidder. The bidders enter bids via the Internet in a real
time format. BID4U submits bids for the high preliminary bidder, up to their
maximum bid. When bidding stops, a countdown is initiated. If no bids are
received during the countdown, the vehicle sells to the highest bidder. VB


opens our sales process to registered buyers
anywhere in the world who have Internet access.

We believe the
implementation of VB


across our salvage
operations has increased the pool of available buyers for each sale and the
added competition has increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for
vehicles from us. We also believe that it has improved the efficiency of our
operations. For fiscal 2006, sales of vehicles to buyers outside the state
where the vehicle is located accounted for 50% of total vehicles sold (26% of
salvage vehicles were sold to out of state buyers and 24% were sold to buyers
out of country, based on registration).


We believe that we offer the highest level of
service in the salvage vehicle sales and auction industry and have established
our leading market position by:

·

providing coverage that
facilitates supplier access to buyers around the world, reducing towing and
third-party storage expenses, offering a local presence for vehicle inspection
stations, and providing prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters
by specially-trained teams;

·

providing a comprehensive
range of customer services that include merchandising services, efficient title
processing, timely pick-up and delivery of vehicles and Internet sales;

·

establishing and
efficiently integrating new facilities and acquisitions;

·

increasing the number of
bidders that can participate at each sale through the ease and convenience of
Internet bidding;

·

applying technology to
enhance operating efficiency through Internet bidding, web-based order
processing, salvage value quotes, electronic communication with buyers and
sellers, vehicle imaging and an electronic used vehicle parts locator service;
and

·

providing the venue for
insurance customers through our Virtual Insured Exchange “VIX” product to enter
a vehicle into a live virtual sale to establish its true value, thereby
allowing the insurance customer to avoid dealing with estimated values when negotiating
with owners who wish to retain their damaged vehicles.

We adopted a
formal plan in fiscal 2006 to discontinue the operations of our public auction
business Motors Auction Group (“MAG”), a wholly owned subsidiary, and dispose
of the related assets or convert them to our salvage business. We operated six
public automobile sales facilities located in Detroit, Michigan; Chesapeake,
Virginia; New Castle, Delaware; Greencastle, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania and Richmond, Virginia. We sold the businesses located in
Chesapeake, New Castle and Greencastle prior to the end of fiscal 2006. We
converted Detroit, Pittsburgh and Richmond into salvage facilities. As of the
end of fiscal 2006 no MAG operations remain.

We were organized as a California corporation in 1982 and became a
public company in 1994. Our principal executive offices are located at 4665
Business Center Drive, Fairfield, California 94534, and our telephone number at
that address is (707) 639-5000. We maintain a website,

http://www.copart.com

, where we make available, free of
charge, our code of ethics and our Securities and Exchange Commission filings,
including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,
current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports
filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file
such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We are providing the address to our website solely for the information of
investors. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by

Industry Overview

The salvage
vehicle industry provides a venue for salvage vehicle suppliers to liquidate
total loss vehicles. Salvage vehicle sales companies generally auction or sell
salvage vehicles on consignment either for a fixed fee or a percentage of the
sales price. On occasion, salvage sales companies may purchase vehicles from
vehicle suppliers at a formula-based price, based on a percentage of the
vehicles’ estimated pre-loss value (“actual cash value”) and sell the vehicles
for their own account. Salvage vehicle sales companies typically operate from one
or more salvage facilities where vehicles are processed, viewed, stored and
sold. However, Copart through the introduction of VB


, eliminated local live
auctions in our operations, and we now sell all our salvage vehicles over the
Internet.


Although there
are other suppliers of salvage vehicles, such as financial institutions,
vehicle leasing companies, automobile rental companies, charities and
automobile dealers, the primary source of salvage vehicles is insurance
companies.

Automobile
manufacturers are incorporating certain standard features that increase
passenger safety, including unibody construction, passenger safety cages with
surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts, plastic components, airbags, xenon
lights and computer systems. We believe that one effect of these features is
that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more likely to be deemed a total
loss for insurance purposes, which could result in an increasing supply of
total loss salvage vehicles in the future.

The primary
buyers of salvage vehicles are vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair
licensees, used vehicle dealers and exporters. Vehicle dismantlers, which we
believe are the largest group of salvage vehicle buyers, either dismantle a
vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders,
used vehicle dealers or the public. Vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair
licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell. Used
vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles
for resale.

Following an
accident involving an insured vehicle, the damaged vehicle is generally towed
to a towing company or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending
insurance company examination. The vehicle is inspected by the insurance
company’s adjuster, who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and
gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage, options and
condition in order to estimate its actual cash value (fair market value). The
adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a
total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs and the vehicle’s
salvage value, as well as customer service considerations. If the cost of
repair is greater than the actual cash value less the estimated salvage value,
the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss. The
insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a salvage vehicle sales
company, settle with the insured vehicle owner and receive title to the
vehicle.

The primary factors that vehicle suppliers
consider when selecting a salvage vehicle sales company include:

·

the anticipated percentage
return on salvage (i.e., gross salvage proceeds, minus vehicle handling and
selling expenses, divided by the actual cash value);

·

the services provided by
the salvage vehicle sales company and the degree to which such services reduce
administrative costs and expenses;

·

the price the salvage
vehicle sales company charges for its services;

·

national coverage and
ability to respond on a national scale; and

·

the ability to generate
custom seller reports.

Upon receipt of
the pick up order (the assignment), the salvage vehicle sales company arranges
for the transport of a vehicle to a facility. As a service to the vehicle
supplier, the salvage vehicle sales company will customarily pay advance
charges (reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle suppliers) to obtain
the subject vehicle’s release from a towing company or vehicle repair facility.
Typically, advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle supplier are recovered
upon sale of the salvage vehicle.

The vehicle then remains in storage until ownership documents are
transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is
cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency (“DMV”).
Total loss vehicles may be sold


in most states only after obtaining a salvage
title from the DMV. Upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the DMV,
which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pick-up, the
vehicle is sold.

Operating and Growth Strategy

Our growth
strategy is to increase our revenues and profitability by, among other things (i) acquiring
and developing new salvage vehicle storage facilities in key markets, (ii) pursuing
national and regional vehicle supply agreements, (iii) expanding our
service offerings to suppliers and buyers and (iv) expanding the
application of VB


into new markets. In addition, we implement
our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to affect cost
efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by introducing our operational
procedures, integrating our management information systems and redeploying
personnel when necessary.

As part of our overall expansion strategy, our objective is to increase
our revenues, operating profits and market share in the vehicle sales industry.
To implement our growth strategy, we intend to continue to do the following:

Acquire and
Develop New Salvage Vehicle Storage Facilities in Key Markets

Our strategy is
to offer integrated services to vehicle suppliers on a national or regional
basis by acquiring or developing salvage facilities in new and existing
markets. We integrate our new acquisitions into our national network and
capitalize on certain operating efficiencies resulting from, among other
things, the reduction of duplicative overhead and the implementation of our
operating procedures.

Pursue National
and Regional Vehicle Supply Agreements

Our broad national presence enhances our ability to enter into local,
regional or national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers. We actively seek
to establish national and regional supply agreements with insurance companies
by promoting our ability to achieve high net returns and broader access to
buyers through our national coverage and electronic commerce capabilities. By
utilizing our existing insurance company supplier relationships, we are able to
build new supplier relationships and pursue additional supply agreements in
existing and new markets.

Expand Our Service
Offerings to Suppliers and Buyers

Over the past several years, we have expanded our available service
offerings to vehicle suppliers and buyers. The primary focus of these new
service offerings is to maximize returns to our suppliers and maximize product
value to our buyers. Recent service enhancements include, for our suppliers,
real-time access to sales data over the Internet and, for our buyers, the
implementation of VB


real-time bidding
at all of our facilities, permitting buyers at any location worldwide to
participate in the sales at all of our yards in North America. We plan to
continue to refine and expand our services, including offering software that
can assist our suppliers in expediting claims and salvage management tools that
help suppliers integrate their systems with ours.

Our Competitive Advantages

We believe that the following attributes and the services that we offer
position us to take advantage of many opportunities in the salvage vehicle
sales industry.

National
Coverage and Ability to Respond on a National Scale

Since our inception in 1982, we have expanded
from a single facility in Vallejo, California to an integrated network of 122
facilities located in the United States and Canada as of July 31, 2006. We
are able to offer integrated services on a national basis to our vehicle
suppliers, which allow us to respond to the needs of our suppliers and buyers
with maximum efficiency. Our national coverage provides our suppliers with key
advantages, including:

·

a reduction in administrative
time and effort;

·

a reduction in overall
vehicle towing costs;

·

convenient local
facilities;

·

improved access to buyers
throughout the world;

·

a prompt response in the
event of a natural disaster or other catastrophe; and

·

consistency
in salvage vehicle processing.

Value-Added
Services

We believe that we offer the most
comprehensive range of services in our industry, including:

·

Internet bidding, Internet
proxy bidding and virtual sales powered by VB


, which enhance the competitive bidding
process;

·

online payment capabilities
via our ePay product;


·

e-mail
notifications to potential buyers of salvage vehicles that match desired
characteristics;

·

sophisticated vehicle
processing at storage sites, including ten-view digital imaging of each vehicle
and the scanning of each vehicle’s title and other significant documents such
as body shop invoices, all of which are available from us through the Internet;

·

CoPartfinder, our
Internet-based used vehicle parts locator that provides vehicle dismantlers
with greater resale opportunities for their salvage purchases;

·

Offsite sales, which allow
vehicle suppliers to sell any vehicle, boat, or heavy equipment without
transporting it to one of our facilities;

·

Specialty sales, which
allow buyers the opportunity to focus on select types of vehicles regardless of
location, as we conduct a single national auction by vehicle type: i.e.
motorcycles, heavy equipment, boats, recreational vehicles and rental cars; and

·

Interactive
Online Counter Bidding, which allows sellers who have placed a minimum bid or a
bid to be approved on a vehicle to directly counter bid the current high
bidder.

Proven Ability
to Acquire and Integrate Acquisitions

We have a proven track record of successfully
acquiring and integrating salvage vehicle storage facilities. Since becoming a
public company in 1994, we have completed the acquisition of 67 salvage vehicle
storage facilities. As part of our acquisition and integration strategy, we
seek to:

·

strengthen our national
network and access new markets;

·

utilize our existing
corporate and technology infrastructure over a larger base of operations; and

·

introduce our comprehensive
services and operational expertise.

We strive to integrate all new facilities into our existing network
without disruption of service to vehicle suppliers. We work with new suppliers
to implement our fee structures and new service programs. We typically retain
existing employees at acquired facilities in order to retain knowledge about,
and respond to, the local market. We also assign a special integration team to
help convert newly acquired facilities to our own management information and
proprietary software systems, enabling us to ensure a smooth and consistent
transition to our business operating and sales systems.

Technology to
Enhance and Expand Our Business

We have developed management information and proprietary software
systems that allow us to deliver a fully integrated service offering. Our
proprietary software programs provide vehicle suppliers with online access to
data and reports regarding their salvage vehicles being processed at any of our
facilities. This technology allows vehicle suppliers to monitor each stage of
our salvage vehicle sales process, from pick up to sale and settlement by the
buyer. Our full range of Internet services allows us to expedite each stage of
the salvage vehicle sales process and minimizes the administrative and
processing costs for us as well as our suppliers. We believe that our
integrated technology systems generate improved capacity and financial returns
for our clients, resulting in high client retention, and allow us to expand our
national supply contracts.


Our Service Offerings

We offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services, which expedite
each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process, maximizing proceeds and
minimizing costs.

Online Supplier
Access

Through Copart Access, our Internet-based service for vehicle
suppliers, we enable suppliers to assign vehicles for sale, check sales
calendars, view vehicle images and history, view and reprint body shop invoices
and towing receipts and view the historical performance of the vehicles sold at
our sales.

Salvage
Estimation Services

We offer Copart ProQuote, a proprietary service that assists suppliers
in the vehicle claims evaluation process by providing online salvage value
estimates, which helps suppliers determine whether to repair a particular
vehicle or deem it a total loss.

Virtual Insured
Exchange (“VIX”)

We provide the venue for insurance customers to enter a vehicle into a
live virtual auction-style sale to establish its true value, thereby allowing
the insurance customer to avoid dealing with estimated values when negotiating
with owners who wish to retain their damaged vehicles.

Transportation
Services

We maintain contracts with third-party vehicle transport companies,
which enables us to pick up most of our suppliers’ vehicles within 24 hours.
Our national network and transportation capabilities provides cost and time
savings to our vehicle suppliers and ensures on-time vehicle pick up and prompt
response to catastrophes and natural disasters.

Vehicle
Inspection Stations

We offer certain of our major insurance company suppliers office and
yard space to house vehicle inspection stations on-site at our storage facilities.
We have over 30 vehicle inspection stations at our facilities nationwide. An
on-site vehicle inspection station provides our insurance company suppliers
with a central location to inspect potential total loss vehicles, which reduces
storage charges that otherwise may be incurred at the initial storage or repair
facility.

On-Demand
Reporting

We provide vehicle suppliers with on-demand reports online, via fax or
e-mail that summarize data on salvage vehicles that we process for the
particular supplier. These reports track our vehicle suppliers’ gross and net
returns on each vehicle, service charges, and other data that enable our
vehicle suppliers to more easily administer and monitor the salvage vehicle
disposition process.

DMV Processing

We have extensive expertise in DMV document and title processing for
salvage vehicles. We have developed a computer system which provides a direct
link to the DMV computer systems of several states. This allows us to expedite
the processing of vehicle title paperwork.


Flexible
Vehicle Processing Programs

At the election of the vehicle supplier, we sell vehicles pursuant to
our Percentage Incentive Program consignment basis or on a fixed fee
consignment basis.

Percentage Fee Consignment.

Our Percentage Incentive Program (“PIP”) is an
innovative processing program designed to broadly serve the needs of vehicle
suppliers. Under PIP, we agree to sell all of the salvage vehicles of a vehicle
supplier in a specified market, usually for a predetermined percentage of the
vehicle sales price. Because our revenues under PIP are directly linked to the
vehicle’s sale price, we have an incentive to actively merchandise those
vehicles to maximize the net return on salvage vehicles. We provide the vehicle
supplier, at our expense, with transport of the vehicle to our nearest
facility, storage for up to 90 days and DMV document and title processing. In
addition, we provide merchandising services such as covering or taping openings
to protect vehicle interiors from weather, washing vehicle exteriors, vacuuming
vehicle interiors, cleaning and polishing dashboards and tires, making keys for
drivable vehicles and identifying drivable vehicles. We believe our
merchandising efforts increase the sales prices of salvage vehicles, thereby increasing
the return on salvage vehicles to both vehicle suppliers and us.

Fixed Fee Consignment.

Under our fixed fee consignment program, we sell
vehicles for a fixed consignment fee, generally $50 to $175 per vehicle.
Although sometimes included in the consignment fee, we may also charge
additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility,
storage of the vehicle, and other incidental costs.

Buyer Network

We maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage
vehicles in the vehicle dismantling, rebuilding, repair, resale and exporting
businesses. Our database includes each buyer’s vehicle preference and
purchasing history. This data enables us to notify via e-mail prospective
buyers throughout the world of salvage vehicles available for bidding that
match their vehicle preferences. Listings of salvage vehicles to be sold on a
particular day and location are also made available on the Internet.

Sales Process

We offer a flexible and unique sales process designed to maximize the sale
prices of the vehicles. We utilize VB


, an auction-style sales methodology that
we developed. This second generation technology combines two bidding processes.
An open Preliminary Bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids either at a
bidding station at the storage facility during the three preview days or over
the Internet. To improve the effectiveness of bidding, the VB


system lets a buyer see the current high bid
on the vehicle they want to purchase. The preliminary bidding phase is an open
sales format. Buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a
vehicle and BID4U will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf.
Preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an Internet-only
virtual sale. BID4U will represent the high preliminary bidder at the
Internet-only virtual sale. This feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid
against each other and the high preliminary bidder. The bidders enter bids via
the Internet in a real time format. BID4U submits bids for the high preliminary
bidder, up to their maximum bid. When bidding stops, a countdown is initiated.
If no bids are received during the countdown, the vehicle sells to the highest
bidder. VB


opens our sales process to registered buyers
anywhere in the world who have Internet access.

CoPartfinder

CoPartfinder is our unique Internet “search engine” that enables users
to locate used vehicle parts quickly and efficiently. CoPartfinder is
accessible by the public through a Copart-sponsored website. CoPartfinder lists
vehicles recently sold through VB



and identifies certain purchasers. This
allows vehicle dismantlers and other resellers to streamline their parts sale
process and access a large pool of potential buyers. Parts buyers can use
CoPartfinder to search for specific vehicle makes and models and view digital
images of vehicles that meet their requirements. Once a specific parts supplier
is identified for a specific part requirement, buyers may have the option to
call, fax, or e-mail the dismantler/supplier. We believe that CoPartfinder
provides an incentive for vehicle dismantlers to purchase their salvage
vehicles through our sales process.

Supply Arrangements and Supplier Marketing

We obtain
salvage vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle suppliers. State Farm Insurance
Company accounted for 14%, 12% and 12% of our revenues for fiscal years 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Of the total number of vehicles that we processed
in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, we obtained approximately 83%, 79% and
85%, respectively, from insurance company suppliers. Our arrangements with our
suppliers are typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90
days notice.

We typically
contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other
vehicle suppliers. The agreements are customized to each vehicle supplier’s
particular needs and often provide for the disposition of different types of
salvage vehicles by differing methods. Our arrangements generally provide that
we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the vehicle
supplier in a designated geographic area.

We market our services to vehicle suppliers through an in-house sales
force that utilizes a variety of sales techniques, including targeted mailing
of our sales literature, telemarketing, follow-up personal sales calls, and
participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions.
Based upon our historical data on salvage vehicles and vehicle information
supplied by vehicle suppliers, our marketing personnel will provide vehicle
suppliers with detailed analysis of the net return on salvage vehicles and a
proposal setting forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns
on salvage vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses.

Buyers

We maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage
vehicles in the vehicle dismantling, rebuilding, repair, resale and export
businesses. We believe that we have established a broad international and
domestic buyer base by providing buyers of salvage vehicles with a variety of
programs and services. To gain admission to one of our sales and become a
registered buyer, prospective buyers must first pay an initial registration fee
and an annual fee, provide requested personal and business information and
have, in most states, a vehicle dismantler’s, dealer’s, resale, repair or
export license. Registration entitles a buyer to transact business at any of
our sales subject to local licensing and permitting requirements. A buyer may
also bring guests to a facility for a fee to preview vehicles for sale. Strict
admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that would
invalidate the sale. We market to buyers on the Internet and via e-mail
notifications, sales notices, telemarketing and participation in trade show
events.

Competition

We face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and
for the buyers of those vehicles. We believe our principal competitors include
vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers. These national,
regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle
suppliers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than
ours. The largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers include the ADESA
Corporation; Auction Broadcasting Company; Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc.;
Manheim Auctions and SADISCO. The largest national dismantlers include
Greenleaf and


LKQ Corporation. These national dismantlers,
in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the American Recycling
Association and the United Recyclers Group, may purchase salvage vehicles
directly from insurance companies, thereby bypassing auction and sales
companies entirely, including us.

Management Information Systems

Our primary
management information system consists of an IBM AS/400 mainframe computer
system, integrated computer interfaces and proprietary business operating
software that we developed and which tracks salvage sales vehicles throughout
the sales process. We call this proprietary business operating software the
Copart Auction System (“CAS”) and have implemented CAS at all of our salvage
storage facilities. In addition, we have integrated our mainframe computer
system with Internet and Intranet systems in order to provide secure access to
CAS data and images in a variety of formats.

Our
auction-style service product, VB


, is served by an array of identical
high-density, high-performance servers. Each individual sale is configured to
run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any
other available server in the array as required. Our sale, Internet and imaging
services are load balanced across different geographical data centers.

We have invested in a production data center that is designed to run
the business in the event of an emergency. The facility’s electrical and
mechanical systems are continually monitored. This facility is located in an
area considered to be free of weather-related disasters and earthquakes.

Employees

As of July 31, 2006, we had approximately 2,133 full-time
employees, of whom approximately 282 were engaged in general and administrative
functions and approximately 1,851 were engaged in yard operations. We are not
currently subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our relationships
with our employees are good.

Environmental Matters

Our operations
are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the protection of the
environment. In the salvage vehicle sales industry, large numbers of wrecked
vehicles are stored at facilities and, during that time, spills of fuel, motor
oils and other fluids may occur, resulting in soil, surface water or
groundwater contamination. Certain of our facilities store petroleum products
and other hazardous materials in above-ground containment tanks and some of our
facilities generate waste materials such as solvents or used oils that must be
disposed of as non-hazardous or hazardous waste, as appropriate. We have
implemented procedures to reduce the amount of soil contamination that may occur
at our facilities, and we have initiated safety programs and training of
personnel on the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials. We believe
that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable
environmental regulations and we do not anticipate any material capital
expenditures to remain in environmental compliance.

In connection
with the acquisition of our Dallas, Texas facility in 1994, we set aside $3.0
million to cover the costs of environmental remediation, stabilization and
related consulting expenses for a six-acre portion of the facility that
contained elevated levels of lead due to the activities of the former
operators. We began the stabilization process in 1996 and completed it in 1999.
We paid all remediation and related costs from the $3.0 million fund and, in
accordance with the acquisition agreement, distributed the remainder of the
fund to the seller of the Dallas facility, less $.2 million which was held back
to cover the costs of obtaining the no-further-action letter. In September 2002,
our environmental engineering consultant issued a report, which concludes that
the soil stabilization has effectively stabilized the lead-impacted soil, and
that the concrete cap should prevent impact to storm water and subsequent
surface water impact. Our consultant thereafter submitted an Operations and
Maintenance


Plan (“Plan”) to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”)
providing for a two-year inspection and maintenance plan for the concrete cap,
and a two-year ground and surface water monitoring plan. In January of
2003, the TCEQ approved the Plan, subject to the additions of upstream
(background) surface water samples from the intermittent stream adjacent to the
facility and documentation of any repairs to the concrete cap during the post
closure-monitoring period. The first semi-annual water sampling was conducted
in April 2003, which reflected that the lead-impacted, stabilized soil is
not impacting the ground and/or surface water. The second round of semi-annual
water samples collected in October and November 2003 reported
concentration of lead in one storm water and one surface water sample in excess
of the established upstream criteria for lead. In correspondence, which we
received in July 2004, the TCEQ approved with comment our water monitoring
report dated February 24, 2004. The TCEQ instructed us to continue with
post-closure monitoring and maintenance activities and submit the next report
in accordance with the approved schedules. In February 2005, a report from
our environmental engineering consultant was transmitted to the TCEQ containing
the results of annual monitoring activities consisting of two (2) semi-annual
sampling events which occurred in April/June 2004 and October/November 2004.
Laboratory analytical results indicated no lead concentrations exceeding the
target concentration level set in the Corrective Measures Study for the site.
The Company’s environmental engineering consultant concluded in the February 2005
report to the TECQ that it is unlikely that lead concentrations detected in the
stormwater runoff samples are attributable to the lead impacted soils. Based on
the results of the 2004 samplings, we requested that no further action be taken
and that a closure letter be issued by the TCEQ. We are not assured of
receiving the no-further-action letter and we may incur further liabilities if
the stabilization process proves ineffective. In addition, in 1994, we detected
a small quantity of two hazardous substances in a temporary groundwater
monitoring well at the Dallas facility. Our environmental consultants concluded
that both substances arose from an off-site source and no further action was
recommended.

We do not believe that any of the above environmental matters will,
either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Governmental Regulations

Our operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing
under various federal, provincial, state and local statutes, ordinances and
regulations. The acquisition and sale of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles
is regulated by state and provincial motor vehicle departments. In addition to
the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles, we are also subject to
various local zoning requirements with regard to the location of our storage
facilities. These zoning requirements vary from location to location. At
various times, we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials
regarding the development and/or operation of our business facilities. We
believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable
regulatory requirements. We may be subject to similar types of regulations by
federal, provincial, state, and local governmental agencies in new markets.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved
in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business,
such as actions related to injuries, property damage, and handling or disposal
of vehicles. This litigation includes the following matters:

Ciano
Dessources filed a lawsuit on May 21, 2003, in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, Superior Court Department against Copart of Connecticut, Inc.
and Copart, Inc. which purported to be a class action on behalf of persons
whose vehicles were disposed of by us as abandoned vehicles, which the named
plaintiff contends were disposed of without complying with state laws. Relief
sought includes class certification, declaratory, remedial and/or injunctive
relief, including the ordering of a


compliance program that will essentially protect consumers, as well as
damages, fees, and costs. Copart’s Motion for Summary Judgment was granted on December 8,
2004, dismissing the class claim element of the lawsuit. On August 9,
2006, Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment was denied. A trial date has
not been set. Copart believes the claim is without merit, and intends to
continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

On September 16,
2005, Richard M. Gray filed suit against Copart and A. Safrin, in the State
Court for the County of Chatham, State of Georgia, alleging a class action for
unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by Copart, and related claims.
Relief sought included class certification, damages, fees, costs and expenses.
Copart has filed a motion for summary judgment, the hearing for which has not
been scheduled. Copart believes the claim is without merit, and intends to
continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

On July 28,
2006, Foreign Car Sales and Service LLC filed suit against Copart in the United
States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana alleging antitrust
violations and unfair trade practices. Relief sought is class certification,
damages, fees, costs and expenses. Plaintiff is in pro per and is demanding a total
award of the now current value of 51% of Copart issued stock. Copart believes
the claim is without merit, and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

On August 7,
2006, Kimberly and Jason Green filed suit against Copart in the Superior Court
of the State of California, County of Sacramento, making allegations pursuant
to a California consumer protection statute similar to a class action for
unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by Copart, and related claims. Relief
sought included class certification, damages, fees, costs and expenses. Copart
filed an answer on September 1, 2006 denying the claim. Copart believes
the claim is without merit, and intends to continue to defend this lawsuit
vigorously.

On June 10,
2005, Manheim Services Corp. filed suit against Copart, Inc. in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division,
alleging infringement of Manheim’s assigned patent (U.S. Patent No. 5,774,873).
Relief sought included a patent infringement judgment, an injunction
prohibiting us from using any infringing product or service (including VB


), damages, fees, costs and
expenses. On August 3, 2005, we denied the claim and asserted
counterclaims based on violations of antitrust laws and common-law tortuous interference
(the “Competition Claims”). On February 10, 2006, the District Court denied
Manheim’s motion to bifurcate the Competition Claims and stayed discovery on
the Competition Claims through April 13, 2006. Additionally, on February 6,
2006, Manheim requested the Court to grant it leave to assert its additional
alleged claims of infringement by us of Manheim’s assigned U.S. Patent No.
6,006,201, The Court denied this request on May 30, 2006. On June 27,
2006, Manheim Services Corp dismissed all claims against us alleging patent
infringement and we dismissed all of our counterclaims against Manheim Services
Corp alleging antitrust violations. The matter was resolved amicably with
express denials of liability from both parties.

We provide for
costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on our future
results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on
future results of operations, the amount and timing of the resolution of such
matters. We believe that any ultimate liability will not have a material effect
on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the
amount of the liabilities associated with these claims, if any, cannot be
determined with certainty.


Item 1A.

Risk
Factors

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we
file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could
cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by
the forward-looking statements contained in this report

We depend on a
limited number of major suppliers of salvage vehicles. The loss of one or more
of these major

suppliers
could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and
an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect
our growth rates.

Historically, a limited number of vehicle suppliers have accounted for
a substantial portion of our revenues. In fiscal 2006, vehicles supplied by our
two largest suppliers accounted for approximately 21% of our revenues. Supplier
arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to
cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice. Vehicle suppliers have
terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets, which has
affected the pricing for sales services in those markets. There can be no
assurance that our existing agreements will not be cancelled. Furthermore,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements
with vehicle suppliers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of
salvage vehicles. A reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle supplier
or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a substantial
vehicle supplier could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, a failure to increase our
sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue
growth rates.

Our strategic
shift from live salvage sales to an entirely Internet-based sales model
presents new risks,

including
substantial technology risks.

In fiscal 2004, we converted all our salvage
sales from a live auction process to an entirely Internet-based auction-style
model based on technology developed internally by us. The conversion represents
a significant change in the way we conduct business and presents numerous
risks, including our increased reliance on the availability and reliability of
our network systems. In particular, we believe the conversion presents the
following risks, among others:

·

Our operating results in a
particular period could be adversely affected in the event our networks are not
operable for an extended period of time for any reason, as a result of Internet
viruses, or as a result of any other technological circumstance that makes us
unable to conduct our virtual sales.

·

Our business is
increasingly reliant on internally developed technology, and we have limited
historic experience developing technologies or systems for large-scale
implementation and use.

·

Our
general and administrative expenses have tended to increase as a percentage of
revenue as our information technology payroll has increased.

·

The change in our business
model may make it more difficult for management, investment analysts, and
investors to model or predict our future operating results until sufficient
historic data is available to evaluate the effect of the VB


implementation over a longer period of time
and in different economic environments.

·

Our
increasing reliance on proprietary technology subjects us to intellectual
property risks, including the risk of third party infringement claims or the
risk that we cannot establish or protect intellectual property rights in our
technologies. We have filed patent applications for VB


in
the United States, Netherlands, and Europe, but we cannot provide any


assurances that patents will actually issue
or that, if issued, the patent could not later be found to be unenforceable or
invalid.

Our operating
results were adversely affected by abnormal expenses associated with hurricanes
Katrina and

Rita during
the year ended July 31, 2006, and our operating margins in future periods
could be adversely affected by the hurricanes.

During the year ended July 31, 2006, we recognized substantial
additional costs associated with hurricanes Katrina and Rita. These additional
costs, characterized as “abnormal” under FAS 151, were recognized during the
year ended July 31, 2006, and include the additional subhauling, payroll,
equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions
created by the hurricanes. We expect these costs to continue in future periods.
These “abnormal” costs do not include the normal expenses associated with the
increased unit volume created by the hurricanes, which are deferred until the
sale of the unit and are reflected in vehicle pooling costs on the balance
sheet. As of July 31, 2006, approximately 28% of the incremental salvage
vehicles received as a result of the hurricanes remained unsold and in
inventory. The Company expects that the majority of these vehicles will be
disposed of primarily in the next two quarters. The Company’s expectation that
we will sell the balance of the unsold hurricane-related vehicles primarily within
the next two quarters is based on management’s current expectations, which
assumes, among other things, that the Gulf Coast region will not experience any
additional adverse weather events, including any additional hurricanes during
the remainder of the 2006 hurricane season. The normal costs that have been
capitalized will be recognized as yard expense as the vehicles are sold.

Our results of
operations may not continue to benefit from the implementation of VB


to the extent we have

experienced in recent
periods.

We believe that the implementation of our proprietary VB


sales technologies across our salvage
operations has had a favorable impact on our results of operations by
increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base and increasing the
average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales. VB


was
implemented across all our salvage yards beginning in the third quarter of
fiscal 2004. We do not believe, however, that we will continue to experience
improvements in our results of operations at the same relative rates we have
experienced in the last year.

Failure to have
sufficient capacity to accept additional cars at one or more of our salvage
yards could

adversely
affect our relationships with insurance companies or other suppliers of salvage
vehicles.

Capacity at our salvage yards varies from period to period and from
region to region. For example, following adverse weather conditions in a
particular area, our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to
accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories. For
example, as discussed above, hurricanes Katrina and Rita had an adverse effect
on our operating results, in part because of yard capacity constraints in the
Gulf Coast area. We regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and,
where appropriate, seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of
additional land and yards. We may not be able to reach agreements to purchase
independent salvage yards in markets where we have limited excess capacity,
and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our
ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land. Failure to
have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our
relationships with insurance companies or other suppliers of salvage vehicles,
which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.


Factors such as
mild weather conditions in the United States can have an adverse effect on our
revenues and

operating
results as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates.

Mild weather conditions in the United States tend to result in a
decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents
decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged. Accordingly, mild weather can have
an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories, which would be expected
to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related
growth rates. Conversely, our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather
such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weather-related conditions
such as flooding. During periods of mild weather conditions, our ability to
increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will
be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle suppliers
and to compete more effectively in the market, each of which is subject to the
other risks and uncertainties described in these sections.

High fuel
prices in the United States and Canada may have an adverse effect on our
revenues and operating

results
as well as our earnings growth rates.

Significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in
miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates. A material reduction in
accident rates could have a material impact on revenue growth. In addition,
under our PIP contracts the cost of towing the vehicle to one of our facilities
is included in the PIP fee. We may incur increased fees which we will not be
able to pass on to the insurance companies. A material increase in tow rates
could have a material impact on our operating results.

The salvage vehicle sales industry is highly
competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully.

We face
significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers
of those vehicles. We believe our principal competitors include other vehicle
sales and auction companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles
from insurance companies and other suppliers, and large vehicle dismantlers,
who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies, bypassing the
salvage sales process. Many of the insurance companies have established
relationships with competitive sales and auction companies and large
dismantlers. Certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources
than us. Due to the limited number of vehicle suppliers, the absence of
long-term contractual commitments between us and our suppliers and the
increasingly competitive market environment, there can be no assurance that our
competitors will not gain market share at our expense.

We may also encounter significant competition for local, regional and
national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers. There can be no assurance
that the existence of other local, regional or national contracts entered into
by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or
our expansion plans. Furthermore, we are likely to face competition from major
competitors in the acquisition of salvage vehicle sales facilities, which could
significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially
impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations. These potential new competitors may include
consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses, organized salvage vehicle
buying groups, automobile manufacturers, automobile auctioneers and software
companies. While most vehicle suppliers have abandoned or reduced efforts to
sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us,
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue, which could adversely
affect our market share, results of operations and financial condition.
Additionally, existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have
greater financial and marketing resources than us; therefore, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.


Because the
growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and
development of new

salvage
vehicle sales facilities, the rate of growth of our business and revenues may
decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and
development of new facilities.

We seek to increase our sales and
profitability through the acquisition of other salvage vehicle sales facilities
and the development of new salvage vehicle storage facilities. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to:

·

continue to acquire
additional facilities on favorable terms;

·

expand existing facilities
in no-growth regulatory environments;

·

increase revenues and
profitability at acquired and new facilities;

·

maintain the historical
revenue and earnings growth rates we have been able to obtain through facility
openings and strategic acquisitions; or

·

create
new salvage vehicle storage facilities that meet our current revenue and
profitability requirements.

As we continue
to expand our operations, our failure to manage growth could harm our business
and

adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to manage growth is not only
dependent on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities, but also on
our ability to:

·

hire, train and manage
additional qualified personnel;

·

establish new relationships
or expand existing relationships with vehicle suppliers;

·

identify and acquire or
lease suitable premises on competitive terms;

·

secure adequate capital;
and

·

maintain the supply of
vehicles from vehicle suppliers.

Our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.

Our annual and quarterly performance may
fluctuate, causing the price of our stock to decline.

Our revenues and operating results have
fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the
future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors, many
of which are beyond our control. Factors that may affect our operating results
include, but are not limited to, the following:

·

fluctuations in the market
value of salvage and used vehicles;

·

the availability of salvage
vehicles;

·

variations in vehicle
accident rates;

·

buyer participation in the
Internet bidding process;

·

delays or changes in state
title processing;


·

changes in state or federal
laws or regulations affecting salvage vehicles;

·

changes in state laws
affecting who may purchase salvage vehicles;

·

our ability to integrate
and manage our acquisitions successfully;

·

the timing and size of our
new facility openings;

·

the announcement of new
vehicle supply agreements by us or our competitors;

·

severity of weather and
seasonality of weather patterns;

·

the amount and timing of
operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and
expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;

·

the availability and cost
of general business insurance;

·

labor costs and collective
bargaining;

·

availability of subhaulers
at competitive rates;

·

acceptance of buyers and
sellers of our Internet-based model deploying VB


, a proprietary Internet auction-style
sales technology;

·

changes in the current
levels of out of state and foreign demand for salvage vehicles;

·

the introduction of a
similar Internet product by a competitor; and

·

the ability to obtain
necessary permits to operate salvage storage facilities.

Due to the foregoing factors, our operating results in one or more
future periods can be expected to fluctuate. As a result, we believe that
period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily
meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future
performance. In the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance
being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the price
of our common stock could decline substantially.

Our strategic
shift to an Internet-based sales model has increased the relative importance of
intellectual

property
assets to our business, and any inability to protect those rights could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of
operations.

Implementation of VB


across our salvage operations has increased
the relative importance of intellectual property rights to our business. Our
intellectual property rights include pending patent applications for VB


as
well as trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property
rights. We are in the process of prosecuting an initial patent application
relating to VB


and
cannot predict whether a patent will actually issue from that application. Even
if a patent is issued, the scope of the protection gained may be insufficient
or any issued patent could subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable. In
addition, we are increasingly entering into agreements with third parties
regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property in foreign
jurisdictions. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available
in every country in which our products and services are distributed, deployed,
or made available. We seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as
trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by third parties, or
intentionally or accidentally by our employees, which would cause us to lose
the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets. Any significant
impairment of our intellectual property rights,


or any inability to protect our intellectual
property rights, could have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.

We have in the past
been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims,
which are

costly to
defend, could require us to pay damages, and could limit our ability to use
certain technologies in the future.

Litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of
intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on
intellectual property rights. Our reliance on intellectual property rights has
increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our VB


auction-style
sales technologies across our business and abandoned live auctions. As we face
increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims
against us grows. Litigation and any other intellectual property claims,
whether with or without merit, can be time-consuming, expensive to litigate and
settle, and can divert management resources and attention from our core
business. An adverse determination in current or future litigation could
prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently
conducted. We may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the
technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may
significantly increase our operating expenses, if it is available for us to license
at all. We could also be required to develop alternative non-infringing
technology, which could require significant effort and expense.

New accounting
pronouncements or new interpretations of existing standards could require us to

make adjustments in our
accounting policies that could adversely affect our financial statements.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and
Exchange Commission, or other accounting organizations or governmental entities
issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting
standards that may require us to change our accounting policies and procedures.
To date, we do not believe any new pronouncements or interpretations have had
an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, but
future pronouncements or interpretations could require us to change our
policies or procedures. Moreover, we continually review our critical accounting
policies in light of the accounting literature and changes in our
operations.

Government
regulation of the salvage vehicle sales and auction industry may impair our
operations, increase

our
costs of doing business and create potential liability.

Participants in the salvage vehicle sales and auction industry are
subject to, and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a
variety of U.S. or Canadian, federal, state, provincial and local governmental,
regulatory and administrative rules, regulations, land use ordinances, licensure
requirements and procedures, including those governing vehicle registration,
the environment, zoning and land use. Failure to comply with present or future
regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in
impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other
liabilities. At various times, we may be involved in disputes with local
governmental officials regarding the development and/or operation of our
business facilities. We believe that we are in compliance in all material
respects with applicable regulatory requirements. We may be subject to similar
types of regulations by federal, provincial, state, and local governmental
agencies in new markets. In addition, new regulatory requirements or changes in
existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities,
may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our
vehicles.


The operation
of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks, which could
adversely affect our

financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Our operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws
and regulations regarding the protection of the environment. In the salvage
vehicle sales industry, large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage
facilities and, during that time, spills of fuel, motor oil and other fluids
may occur, resulting in soil, surface water or groundwater contamination. In
addition, certain of our facilities generate and/or store petroleum products
and other hazardous materials, including waste solvents and used oil. We could
incur substantial expenditures for preventative, investigative or remedial
action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations,
contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities, or the
disposal of our waste at off-site locations. Environmental laws and regulations
could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or
our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future. Although
we have obtained indemnification for pre-existing environmental liabilities
from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities,
there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate. Any such
expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition.

If we experience problems with our providers
of fleet operations, our business could be harmed.

We rely upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to
and from our storage facilities. Our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in
a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, an increase in fuel
cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers, which
may significantly increase our cost. These costs may not be passed on to our
sellers or buyers.

We are partially self-insured for certain
losses.

We are partially self-insured for certain losses related to medical
insurance, general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability. Our
liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of
the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is
established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates.
While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information
currently available, if actual trends, including the severity of claims and
medical cost inflation, differ from our estimates, our results of operations
could be impacted. Further, we rely on independent actuaries to assist us in
establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated
with these self-insured exposures.

Our executive
officers, directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock
and their interests

may
differ from other shareholders.

Our executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially
own, in the aggregate, approximately 21% of our common stock as of July 31,
2006. If they were to act together, these shareholders would have significant
influence over most matters requiring approval by shareholders, including the
election of directors, any amendments to our articles of incorporation and
certain significant corporate transactions, including potential merger or
acquisition transactions. In addition, without the consent of these
shareholders, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions
that could be beneficial to us or our other investors. These shareholders may
take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors.


We have a
shareholder rights plan, or poison pill, which could affect the price of our
common stock and make

it
more difficult for a potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our
securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest, or to acquire us.

In March 2003, our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights
plan, commonly known as a poison pill. The poison pill may discourage, delay,
or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities,
initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, or acquiring us through an
acquisition, merger, or similar transaction. Such an acquirer could be
prevented from consummating one of these transactions even if our shareholders
might receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices.

If we lose key
management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our
business, we may not

be
able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives.

Our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and
performance of our executive management team, all of whom are employed on an
at-will basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete. If
we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees,
in particular Willis J. Johnson, our Chief Executive Officer, and A. Jayson
Adair, our President, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or
otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able to
successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives.

Compliance with new rules and
regulations concerning corporate governance may be costly and time

consuming.

The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley, requires, among other things,
that companies adopt new corporate governance measures, imposes comprehensive
reporting and disclosure requirements, sets stricter independence and financial
expertise standards for board and audit committee members and imposes increased
civil and criminal penalties for companies, their chief executive officers and
chief financial officers for securities law violations. In addition, the Nasdaq
Global Select Market, on which our common stock is traded, has adopted
additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate
governance. These laws, rules and regulations will increase the scope,
complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure
practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management’s
attention from business operations. These new rules and regulations may
also make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and
officer liability insurance and make it more difficult for us to attract and
retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on
our audit committee.

Properties

Our
corporate headquarters are located in Fairfield, California. This facility
consists of approximately 100,000 square feet of office space owned by Copart.
We also own or lease an additional 122 operating facilities. In the United
States we have facilities in every state except Delaware, New Hampshire, North
Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming. In Canada we are only
in the province of Ontario. We believe that our existing facilities are
adequate to meet current requirements and that suitable additional or
substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of
operations and additional offices.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved in litigation
and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business, such as actions
related to injuries, property damage, and handling or disposal of vehicles.
This litigation includes the following matters:

Ciano Dessources filed a
lawsuit on May 21, 2003, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Superior
Court Department against Copart of Connecticut, Inc. and Copart, Inc.
which purported to be a class action on behalf of persons whose vehicles were
disposed of by us as abandoned vehicles, which the named plaintiff contends
were disposed of without complying with state laws. Relief sought includes
class certification, declaratory, remedial and/or injunctive relief, including
the ordering of a compliance program that will essentially protect consumers,
as well as damages, fees, and costs. Copart’s Motion for Summary Judgment was
granted on December 8, 2004, dismissing the class claim element of the
lawsuit. On August 9, 2006, Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment was
denied. A trial date has not been set. Copart believes the claim is
without merit, and intends to continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

On September 16, 2005,
Richard M. Gray filed suit against Copart and A. Safrin, in the State Court for
the County of Chatham, State of Georgia, alleging a class action for
unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by Copart, and related claims.
Relief sought included class certification, damages, fees, costs and expenses.
Copart has filed a motion for summary judgment, the


hearing
for which has not been scheduled. Copart believes the claim is without merit,
and intends to continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

On July 28, 2006, Foreign
Car Sales and Service LLC filed suit against Copart in the United States
District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana alleging antitrust
violations and unfair trade practices. Relief sought is class certification,
damages, fees, costs and expenses. Plaintiff is in pro per and is demanding a
total award of the now current value of 51% of Copart issued stock. Copart
believes the claim is without merit, and intends to defend the lawsuit
vigorously.

On August 7, 2006,
Kimberly and Jason Green filed suit against Copart in the Superior Court of the
State of California, County of Sacramento, making allegations pursuant to a
California consumer protection statute similar to a class action for unreasonable
amounts claimed for storage liens by Copart, and related claims. Relief sought
included class certification, damages, fees, costs and expenses. Copart filed
an answer on September 1, 2006 denying the claim. Copart believes the
claim is without merit and intends to continue to defend this lawsuit
vigorously.

On June 10, 2005, Manheim
Services Corp. filed suit against Copart, Inc. in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, alleging
infringement of Manheim’s assigned patent (U.S. Patent No. 5,774,873).
Relief sought included a patent infringement judgment, an injunction
prohibiting us from using any infringing product or service (including VB


), damages, fees, costs and expenses. On August 3, 2005, we
denied the claim and asserted counterclaims based on violations of antitrust
laws and common-law tortuous interference (the
“Competition Claims”). On February 10, 2006, the District Court denied
Manheim’s motion to bifurcate the Competition Claims and stayed discovery on
the Competition Claims through April 13, 2006. Additionally, on February 6,
2006, Manheim requested the Court to grant it leave to assert its additional
alleged claims of infringement by us of Manheim’s assigned U.S. Patent No.
6,006,201, The Court denied this request on May 30, 2006. On June 27, 2006,
Manheim Services Corp dismissed all claims against us alleging patent
infringement and we dismissed all of our counterclaims against Manheim Services
Corp alleging antitrust violations. The matter was resolved amicably with
express denials of liability from both parties.

We
provide for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the
amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters
on our future results of operations cannot be predicted because any such effect
depends on future results of operations, the amount and timing of the
resolution of such matters. We believe that any ultimate liability will not
have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. However, the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims, if
any, cannot be determined with certainty.

Dividend Policies

We have not paid a cash
dividend since becoming a public company in 1994. We currently intend to retain
any earnings for use in our business and do not anticipate paying any cash
dividends in the foreseeable future.

We
expect to continue to use cash flows from operations to finance our working
capital needs and to develop and grow our business. In addition to our stock
repurchase, we are considering a variety of alternative potential uses for our
remaining cash balances and our cash flow from operations. These alternative
potential uses include additional stock repurchases, the payment of dividends
and acquisitions.

Stock Repurchase

In February 2003, our
Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 9.0 million shares of our
common stock. The repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited
transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. No
time limit has been placed on the duration of the share repurchase program. The
repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem
appropriate and may be discontinued at any time. For the year ended July 31,
2006, we repurchased 366,000 shares at a weighted average price of $24.24. For
the year ended July 31, 2005, we did not repurchase any shares. The total
number of shares repurchased under the program as of July 31, 2006 is
approximately 4.0 million, leaving approximately 5.0 million available under
the repurchase program.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This report, including the information
incorporated by reference herein, contains forward-looking statements within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In some cases, you can identify
forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,”
“intend,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,”
“continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. The
forward-looking statements contained in this report involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and situations that may cause our or our industry’s actual
results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These factors include
those listed in Item 1A. Business under the caption entitled “Risk
Factors” beginning on page 15 of this report and those discussed elsewhere
in this report. We encourage investors to review these factors carefully.

Although we
believe that, based on information currently available to Copart and its
management, the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance
or achievements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements.

Overview

We provide
vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance companies, with a full range of services
to process and sell salvage vehicles over the Internet through our Virtual
Bidding Second Generation (“VB


”) Internet auction-style sales
technology. We sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders,
repair licensees, used vehicle dealers and exporters. Salvage vehicles are
either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes
or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the
vehicle owner has already been made. We offer vehicle suppliers a full range of
services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and
minimize administrative and processing costs. We generate revenues primarily
from fees paid by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees
for services such as towing and storage.

At the election
of the vehicle supplier, we sell vehicles pursuant to our Percentage Incentive
Program (“PIP”) consignment basis or on a fixed fee consignment basis. Under
the PIP program, we agree to sell all of the salvage vehicles of a vehicle
supplier in a specified market usually for a predetermined percentage of the
vehicle sales price. Under our fixed fee consignment program, we sell vehicles
for a fixed consignment fee. Although sometimes included in the consignment
fee, we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the
vehicle to our facility, storage of the vehicle, and other incidental costs.
Using either consignment method, only the fees associated with vehicle
processing are recorded in revenue, not the actual sales price (“gross proceeds”).

Our revenues
consist of salvage fees charged to vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers,
transportation revenue and purchased vehicle revenues. Salvage fees from
vehicle suppliers include sales fees under PIP agreements and fixed fee
programs where we charge for title processing, special preparation, storage and
selling. Salvage fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for
purchasing vehicles, storage and annual registration. Transportation revenue
includes charges to suppliers for towing vehicles under certain contracts.
Transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for
delivering vehicles. Purchased vehicle revenues are comprised of the price that
buyers paid for vehicles that we own.

Costs
attributable to yard operations consist primarily of operating personnel (which
includes yard management, clerical and yard employees), rent, contract vehicle
towing, insurance, fuel, equipment maintenance and repair, and costs of
vehicles we sold


under purchase contracts. Costs associated with general and
administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management, accounting,
data processing, sales personnel, human resources, professional fees, research
and development and marketing expenses.

During fiscal
2004, we converted all of our salvage vehicle auction facilities to an
Internet-based auction-style model using our VB


Internet sales technology. This process
employs a two-step bidding process. The first step, called the preliminary bid,
allows buyers to submit bids up to one hour before a real time virtual action
begins. The second step allows buyers to bid against each other, and the high
bidder from the preliminary bidding process, in a real-time process over the
Internet.

During the
second quarter of fiscal 2006, we adopted a formal plan to discontinue the
operations of our public auction business Motors Auction Group (“MAG”) and
dispose of or convert the related assets. The MAG yards converted into salvage
facilities will continue to be included in the results of continuing operations
on the income statements.

The period-to-period comparability of our operating results and
financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions, new
openings, weather and product introductions during such periods.

Acquisitions and New Operations

We have
experienced significant growth as we have acquired twelve vehicle storage
facilities and established thirteen new facilities since the beginning of
fiscal 2004. All of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting.

As part of our
overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle
suppliers, we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions, as
well as the regions currently served by our facilities. As part of this
strategy, in fiscal 2006 we acquired new facilities in or near Greenwood,
Nebraska; Grand Island, Nebraska; York Haven, Pennsylvania; Chambersburg,
Pennsylvania; Altoona, Pennsylvania; Fruitland, Maryland; Billings, Montana and
opened new facilities in or near Honolulu, Hawaii; Lansing, Michigan; Dover,
Florida and Jacksonville, Florida. In fiscal 2005 we acquired new facilities in
or near Lexington, Kentucky and Columbia, Missouri and opened new facilities in
Strongsville, Ohio; Ocala, Florida; Knoxville, Tennessee; Loganville, Georgia;
Spokane, Washington; Tallahassee, Florida and Hialeah, Florida. In fiscal 2004
we acquired new facilities in or near Eugene, Oregon; Cleveland, Ohio and
Anchorage, Alaska and opened new facilities in or near Toronto, Canada and
Helena, Montana. We believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our
coverage as we have 122 facilities located in North America and are able to
provide national coverage for our suppliers.

We seek to increase revenues and profitability by, among other things, (i) acquiring
and developing new salvage vehicle storage facilities in key markets, (ii) pursuing
national and regional vehicle supply agreements, (iii) expanding our
service offerings to suppliers and buyers, and (iv) expanding the application
of VB


into new markets. In addition, we implement
our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost
efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational
procedures, integrating our management information systems and redeploying
personnel, when necessary.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation
of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On
an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to vehicle
pooling costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, income taxes, long-lived
assets and self insured liabilities. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on


various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

Management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies
and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit
Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies
and estimates in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our significant
accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial
statements for fiscal 2006. The following is a summary of the more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements:

Revenue Recognition

We provide a
portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and
delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer. These services include the ability
to use our Internet sales technology and vehicle delivery, loading, title
processing, preparation and storage. We evaluate multiple-element arrangements
relative to our buyer and seller agreements in accordance with Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables

(“EITF 00-21”), which addresses accounting
for multiple-element arrangements, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(“SAB104”), which
addresses revenue recognition for units of accounting.

The services we
provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller’s
behalf and under most of our current contracts, collecting the proceeds from
the buyer. We are not entitled to any such seller fees until we have collected
the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller and, accordingly, we recognize
revenue for seller services after service delivery and cash collection.

In certain
cases, seller fees are not contingent upon collection of the seller proceeds
from the buyer. However, we determined that we are not able to separate the
services into separate units of accounting because we do not have fair value
for undelivered items. As a result, we do not recognize seller fees until the
final seller service has been delivered, which generally occurs upon collection
of the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller.

We provide a
number of services to the buyer of the vehicle, charging a separate fee for
each service. Each of these services has been assessed under the criteria of
EITF 00-21 to determine whether we have met the requirements to
separate them into units of accounting within a multi-element arrangement. We
have concluded that the auction service and the post-auction services are
separate units of accounting. The fees for the auction service are recognized
upon completion of the auction, and the fees for the post-auction services are
recognized upon successful completion of those services using the residual
method.

We also charge buyers an annual registration fee for the right to
participate in our vehicle sales program, which is recognized ratably over the
term of the arrangement, and relist and late-payment fees, which are recognized
upon receipt of payment by the buyer. No provision for returns has been
established, as all sales are final with no right of return, although we
provide for bad debt expense in the case of non-performance by our buyers and
sellers.

Vehicle Pooling Costs

We defer, in
vehicle pooling costs, certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles
consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date. We
quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of
vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period, the number
of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation
expenses of the period. The primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain
facility costs, labor,


transportation, and vehicle processing. If our allocation factors
change, then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly
in the future. These costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent
periods on an average cost basis.

We apply the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”), No. 151,

Inventory Costs

(“SFAS 151”) to our vehicle pooling costs. SFAS 151 requires that items
such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight and
rehandling costs be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether
they meet the criteria of “so abnormal” as provided in Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing.” In addition,
SFAS 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the
costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities.
The adoption of SFAS 151 increased yard expenses during fiscal 2006, as
the Company incurred additional subhauling, payroll, equipment and facilities
costs associated with hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for
estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to suppliers or buyers
and the inability of our suppliers or buyers to make required payments. If
billing disputes exceed expectations and/or if the financial condition of our
suppliers or buyers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required.

Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles

We evaluate the impairment of goodwill of our salvage sales operating
segment, annually (or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present) by
comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value. Future
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating
segment could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the
investment, thereby requiring impairment charges in the future.

Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets

We are also required to estimate income tax provisions and amounts
ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions. Such estimates
involve significant interpretations of regulations and are inherently very
complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may
not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year.

We also evaluate
the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. Generally
accepted accounting principles require the assessment of the Company’s
performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a
valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets. The Company’s
ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate
future taxable income. Accordingly, the Company has established a valuation
allowance when, in certain taxable jurisdictions, the utilization of the tax
asset is uncertain. Additional timing differences, future earning trends and/or
tax strategies may occur which could warrant a need for establishing an
additional valuation allowance or a reserve.

Long-lived Asset Valuation

We evaluate long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated
undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the
estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future, we may be required to
reduce the carrying amount of an asset.


Stock-Based Compensation

We account for our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees
using the fair value method as required by SFAS No. 123(R), share-based
payment. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that the compensation cost related
to share-based payment transactions, measured based on the fair value of the
equity or liability instruments issued, be recognized in the financial
statements. Determining the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes
model, or other currently accepted option valuation models, requires highly
subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected
time until exercise, which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the
grant date. If actual results are not consistent with the Company’s assumptions
and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, the Company may be
required to record additional compensation or income tax expense, which could
have a material impact on financial position and results of operations.

Retained Insurance Liabilities

We are partially self-insured for certain losses related to medical,
general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability. Our liability
represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the
balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is
established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates.
While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information
currently available, if actual trends, including the severity of claims and
medical cost inflation, differ from our estimates, our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows could be impacted.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth for the
periods indicated below, certain information derived from our consolidated
statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenues. There can be no
assurance that any trend in operating results will continue in the future.

Fiscal 2006
Compared to Fiscal 2005

Revenues from
continuing operations were approximately $528.6 million during fiscal 2006, an
increase of approximately $80.8 million, or 18.1%, over fiscal 2005. The
increase was due to increased vehicle sales volume and increased revenue per
transaction driven by increased auction proceeds per vehicle. The increase in
unit volume was driven by the additional salvage vehicles associated with
hurricanes Katrina and Rita, growth in vehicles processed at existing yards and
vehicles processed from new yards opened or acquired in fiscal 2006. The
increase in gross proceeds per vehicle (the gross sales price of the vehicle at
auction) yields higher revenue per car as buyer fees and certain seller fees,
including those sold under the PIP program, are based on the gross proceeds per
vehicle and generally increase as gross proceeds per vehicle grow. We believe
the increase in recent


periods in proceeds per vehicle has been largely attributable to VB


, which allows more buyers to
participate in the auctions. Given that VB


has now been
implemented across all of our yards for approximately two years, we do not
expect to continue to experience the same incremental favorable impact from VB


that we have experienced in prior periods.
Existing facilities contributed approximately $71.3 million of the revenue
growth and new facilities in or near Honolulu, Hawaii; Greenwood, Nebraska;
Grand Island, Nebraska; York Haven, Pennsylvania; Chambersburg, Pennsylvania;
Altoona, Pennsylvania; Fruitland, Maryland; Lansing, Michigan and Billings,
Montana contributed approximately $9.5 million of new revenue growth.

Yard operation
expenses from continuing operations were approximately $298.0 million during
fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately $52.4 million, or 21.3%, over fiscal
2005. Included in yard expenses is depreciation expense of $26.9 million, an
increase of $0.3 million over fiscal 2005. Yard operation expenses increased to
56.4% of revenues during fiscal 2006, as compared to 54.9% of revenues during
fiscal 2005. The increases in yard expenses were primarily attributable to the
cost of handling increased volume, a general increase in subhauling costs and
the incremental abnormal costs incurred as a result of hurricanes Katrina and
Rita. These additional inventory-type costs were approximately $14.1 million in
fiscal 2006 and were charged to yard operations in accordance with SFAS 151.
These costs include the additional subhauling, payroll, equipment and
facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the
hurricanes. These costs do not include normal expenses associated with the
increased unit volume created by the hurricanes, which are deferred until the
sale of the units and are recognized as vehicle pooling costs on the balance
sheet. At the end of the year, approximately 28% of the incremental salvage
vehicles received as a result of the hurricanes remained unsold and in
inventory. We expect the majority of these vehicles to be disposed primarily in
the next two quarters. If the Gulf Coast region were to experience additional
hurricanes or adverse weather conditions during the recently commenced
hurricane season, we may be unable to sell the existing vehicles within the
currently anticipated time frame, which may have an adverse effect on our
operating results. The processing of the hurricane vehicles has had and may continue
to have a negative impact on gross and operating margin percentages.

General and
administrative expenses from continuing operations were approximately $59.0
million during fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately $13.4 million, or
29.3%, over fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to increases in
telecommunication costs, information technology payroll costs, costs relating
to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, SFAS 123(R) stock compensation costs and
outside legal expense associated with a patent litigation matter that was
settled during fiscal 2006 and other pending litigation and general corporate
expansion. General and administrative expenses increased to 11.2% of revenues
during fiscal 2006, as compared to 10.2% of revenues during fiscal 2005. The
increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total
revenues reflects in part changes in the nature of our business. In particular,
the introduction of VB


resulted in a
reduction in certain yard operation expenses relating to conducting live
auctions but increased our general and administrative expenses as we continue
to make technology infrastructure investments and hire additional personnel to
enhance and maintain VB


and other products for use in our auctions.

Total other income
was approximately $3.0 million during fiscal 2006, a decrease of approximately
$5.2 million, from fiscal 2005. The decrease was due primarily to a $6.8
million loss recognized from an equity investment in an unconsolidated
privately-held entity. We expect to recognize additional losses on this
investment as the entity incurs development stage operating losses. Our
aggregate losses are limited to the amount of our investment. This loss was
offset by an increase in interest income of approximately $3.3 million due to
higher interest rates and a higher average cash and investments balance. Other
income, which consists primarily of rental income and gain on the sales of
non-fleet assets, decreased approximately $1.7 million, resulting from losses
on disposals of fixed assets.

Our effective
combined federal, state and local income tax rates for fiscal 2006 and 2005 was
approximately 35.4% and 38.1%, respectively. The decrease in effective tax rate
is primarily the result of recording a $1.8 million out-of-period reduction to


deferred tax liabilities and income tax expense originating primarily
in 2001 and adjustments to our state tax reserves based on the favorable
outcome of an audit.

During the
second quarter of fiscal 2006 we adopted a formal plan to discontinue the
operations of our public auction business Motors Auction Group (“MAG”) and
dispose of or convert the related assets. The MAG yards to be converted into
salvage facilities will continue to be included in the results of continuing
operations on the income statements.

Under Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for
impairment by applying a fair value-based test or on an interim basis if certain
indicators are present. The discontinuation of an operating segment is one of
those indicators. Accordingly, goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 142 as of the second quarter of 2006.
We used a combination of valuation techniques, which included consideration of
market-based approaches and an income approach, in determining the fair value
of our applicable reporting unit in the interim impairment test of goodwill.

The impairment
test indicated that the carrying value of the MAG goodwill exceeded its implied
fair value. The corresponding write-down of goodwill of $21.8 million to its
fair value was reported as a component of discontinued operations in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. We also determined that the
value of the remaining MAG covenants not to compete were impaired and recorded
an impairment expense in the amount of $0.5 million. This write-down of
covenants not to compete is also reported as a component of discontinued operations
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

During the
second quarter of fiscal 2006, we sold the business and related assets of one
of the MAG locations for approximately $0.1 million. During the third quarter
of fiscal 2006, we sold the business and related assets including the real
estate of one of the MAG locations. We received a $12 million promissory note
from the buyer as purchase consideration. The promissory note bears interest at
7% per annum. Interest only payments on the note are due monthly until maturity
on May 28, 2011, at which time the balance of the note is due in full. The
note receivable is collateralized by the real estate and is personally
guaranteed by the buyer. The consideration was allocated to the real estate,
based on an appraisal, and to the business in proportion to their estimated
fair values. The portion of the consideration allocated to the real estate sale
totaled $7.1 million. We deferred a gain on the sale of the real estate of
approximately $2.5 million that will be recognized upon payment of the
principal balance of the note receivable. The remaining consideration of $4.9
million is allocated to the sale of the business. We recognized a gain on the
sale of the business of approximately $3.0 million, which is included in the
results of the discontinued operations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2006, we sold the business and related assets excluding the real estate of
another MAG location. We received a $1.2 million promissory note and $0.2 million
in cash from the buyer as purchase consideration. We recognized a gain on the
sale of the business of approximately $1.3 million which is included in the
results of discontinued operations. As of July 31, 2006, no MAG locations
remain. Three of the original six MAG locations were sold and three are being
converted into salvage facilities.

Due to the foregoing factors, we realized net income of approximately
$96.9 million for fiscal 2006, compared to net income of approximately $102.1
million for fiscal 2005.

Fiscal 2005
Compared to Fiscal 2004

Revenues from
continuing operations were approximately $447.7 million during fiscal 2005, an
increase of approximately $56.7 million, or 14.5%, over fiscal 2004. The
increase was due primarily to increased vehicle sales volume, on which fees are
generated and higher fees resulting from increased sales proceeds per vehicle. The
increase in gross proceeds per vehicle (the gross sales price of the vehicle)
yields higher revenue per car as buyer fees and certain fees, including those
sold under the PIP


program, are based on the gross proceeds per vehicle and generally
increase as gross proceeds per vehicle grow. We believe the increase in
proceeds per vehicle was the result of the introduction of Virtual Bidding
Second Generation “VB


” as more buyers are able to participate in the sales.
Existing facilities contributed approximately $52.1 million of the revenue
growth and new facilities in or near Strongsville, Ohio; Ocala, Florida;
Knoxville, Tennessee; Lexington, Kentucky; Loganville, Georgia; Spokane,
Washington; Tallahassee, Florida; Hialeah, Florida and Columbia, Missouri
contributed approximately $4.6 million of new revenue.

Historically,
we recorded revenue for most seller and buyer fees upon completion of a sale. During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we recorded a correction of an error to
account for our services in accordance with the policy above; the effect of
which was to reduce revenue from continuing operations, net income and diluted
earnings per share by $4.4 million, $1.5 million and $0.01,
respectively for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2005.

Yard operation
expenses from continuing operations were approximately $245.7 million during
fiscal 2005, an increase of approximately $18.0 million, or 7.9%, over fiscal
2004. Included in yard operation expenses is depreciation expense of $26.6
million, an increase of $0.7 million over fiscal 2004. The increase in yard
operation expenses was due principally to the cost of handling increased volume
at existing operations and the costs of new facilities. Approximately $4.4
million of the increase was the result of the acquisition and opening of new
facilities. Yard operation expenses from existing facilities grew by
approximately $13.1 million, or 6%. Yard operation expenses decreased to 55% of
revenues during fiscal 2005, as compared to 58% of revenues during fiscal 2004,
due in part to the fixed cost nature of our business and the reduction or
elimination of certain yard costs resulting from the implementation of VB


. Yard operation expenses in
fiscal 2004 included a net adjustment to insurance reserves and sales taxes
that decreased this expense by $3.6 million.

General and
administrative expenses from continuing operations were approximately $45.6
million during fiscal 2005, an increase of approximately $6.7 million, or
17.2%, over fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to increases in
software development cost, technology hardware leasing cost, and IT payroll
costs, all directly associated with the development and deployment of VB


. In addition, the Company saw
increases in the cost of professional services, impacted by Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance and increased payroll and benefit costs associated with expanded
support headcount. General and administrative expenses remained relatively flat
as a percentage of revenues during fiscal 2005 and 2004.

Total other
income was approximately $8.2 million during fiscal 2005, an increase of
approximately $2.7 million, or 49.4%, from fiscal 2004. The increase was due
primarily to an increase in interest income of approximately $3.4 million due
to higher interest rates and a higher cash balance. Gain on the sale of fleet
equipment decreased approximately $1.4 million as we sold the majority of the fleet
in fiscal 2004 in connection with our decision to subcontract towing services.
Other income, which consists primarily of rental income, increased
approximately $0.7 million as we continued the rental of primarily unutilized
areas within our facilities.

Our effective
combined federal, state and local income tax rate from continuing operations for
fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was approximately 38.1% and 39.2%, respectively

. The decrease in rate is attributable to an
overall lower state tax rate, as we made certain revisions to our transfer
pricing methodology and the beneficial impact of the growth in interest income
which is predominantly federal tax exempt.

Due to the foregoing factors, we realized net income of approximately
$102.1 million for fiscal 2005, compared to net income of approximately $79.2
million for fiscal 2004.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically,
we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations, public
offerings of common stock, the equity issued in conjunction with certain
acquisitions and debt financing. Cash and cash equivalents, combined with
short-term investments increased by approximately $22.8 million from July 31,
2005 to July 31, 2006, as a result of cash generated from continuing
operations which was reduced by cash used for acquisitions, purchases of
property and equipment, an equity investment in an unconsolidated
privately-held entity and repurchases of common stock. During the winter
months, most of our facilities process 10% to 30% more vehicles than at other
times of the year. This increased seasonal volume requires the increased use of
our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business. Our
primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of
sellers’ fees, buyers’ fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of
auctioned salvage vehicles.

As of July 31,
2006, we had working capital of approximately $328.0 million, including cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $275.3 million.
During the course of the year, we invest substantially all of our cash balances
in AAA rated auction rate securities and typically convert a portion of these
securities to cash and cash equivalents prior to the end of each quarter.
Auction rate securities are principally variable rate securities tied to
short-term interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in
excess of 90 days. Auction rate securities have interest rate resets through a
modified Dutch auction, at predetermined short-term intervals, usually every 7,
28 or 35 days. They trade at par and are callable at par on any interest
payment date at the option of the issuer. Interest paid during a given period
is based upon the interest rate determined during the prior auction. Although
these instruments are issued and rated as long-term securities, they are priced
and traded as short-term securities because of the liquidity provided through
the interest rate reset.

We believe that our currently available cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to
satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12
months. However, if we experience significant growth in the future, we
may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt
or additional equity.

Operating
Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $6.0
million to $141.9 million during fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005.
During the year we consumed cash through the growth in accounts receivable and
vehicle pooling costs and we generated cash through the growth in deferred
revenue. The movements in these accounts are driven primarily by the
significant growth in vehicles held for sale which was impacted by hurricanes
Katrina and Rita. The decrease in net income is primarily a result of the loss
on discontinued operations in the amount of $17.9 million, which was offset by
increased revenue due to growth in vehicle sales volume and higher fees
resulting from increased auction proceeds per vehicle.

Investing
Activities

During the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2006, we purchased approximately $717.1 million
in short-term investments. These purchases were partially offset by the sale of
$568.4 million of short-term investments. We typically invest our cash in
auction rate notes with ratings of AAA.

Capital
expenditures related to continuing operations (excluding those associated with
fixed assets attributable to acquisitions) were approximately $97.0 million, $66.2
million and $61.8 million for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our
capital expenditures are related primarily to opening and improving facilities
and acquiring yard equipment. We continue to


expand and invest in new and existing facilities in order to handle
increased volume and standardize the appearance of existing locations.

During the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2006, we used cash for the acquisition of
facilities in or near Billings, Montana; Fruitland, Maryland; Altoona,
Pennsylvania; Chambersburg , Pennsylvania; York Haven, Pennsylvania; Greenwood,
Nebraska and Grand Island, Nebraska, which had an aggregate cash cost of
approximately $23.0 million. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2005,
we used cash for the acquisition of operations in Lexington, Kentucky and
Columbia, Missouri, which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately $4.5
million. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004, we used cash for the
acquisition of operations in Eugene, Oregon; Cleveland, Ohio and Anchorage,
Alaska, which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately $4.7 million.

During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2006, we invested
approximately $8.9 million for a 50% equity interest in a limited liability
corporation (the “LLC”). We are not committed to provide any additional funding
to this entity.

Financing
Activities

In fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004, we generated approximately $5.4 million, $1.8 million and $5.1
million, respectively, through the exercise of stock options.

In fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004, we generated approximately $1.6 million, $1.4 million and $1.3
million, respectively, through the issuance of shares under the employee stock
purchase program.

In February 2003, our Board of Directors authorized us to
repurchase up to 9.0 million shares of our common stock. The repurchases
may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open
market or in privately negotiated transactions. No time limit has been placed
on the duration of the share repurchase program. The repurchases will be made
at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be
discontinued at any time. For the year ended July 31, 2006, we repurchased
366,000 shares at a weighted average price of $24.24. We accounted for the
repurchase of our common stock by reducing common stock for $8.9 million.
During the period from February 2003 through July 31, 2006, we
repurchased a total of 4,038,300 shares at a weighted average price of $9.92.
No shares were repurchased in fiscal 2005. For the year ended July 31,
2004, we repurchased a total of 977,100 shares at a weighted average price of
$10.97 per share. We accounted for the repurchases of our common stock by
decreasing common stock by $31.2 million. For the period from August 1,
2006 through October 30, 2006, we have not repurchased any shares of our
common stock.

Our principal
exposures to financial market risk are interest rate and foreign currency risk.
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to
our investment portfolio of marketable securities. As of July 31, 2006, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts,
which bear interest at a variable rate and AAA rated auction rate securities,
which also bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average maturity and
nature of the Company’s investment portfolio, we believe a sudden change in
interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio. As the interest rates on a
material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are
variable, a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would
impact interest income along with cash flows, but would not materially impact
the fair market value of the related underlying instruments.

Our exposure to foreign currency risks relates to our operations in
Canada, which have not been significant. We do not hedge our exposure to the
Canadian dollar. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
or trading purposes.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

We conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, or “Disclosure Controls,” as of the end of the period
covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. This evaluation, or “Controls
Evaluation” was performed under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and
Director (our “CEO”) and our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
(our “CFO”). Disclosure Controls are controls and procedures designed to
provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), such as this annual


report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
forms. Disclosure Controls include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Our Disclosure Controls include some, but not
all, components of our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal
control over financial reporting was also separately evaluated as of the end of
the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K in connection
with Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting which is
set forth below.

Based upon the Controls Evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that
as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K,
our Disclosure Controls were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is accumulated
and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, and that such information is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Our management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial
reporting (as such item is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f)) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Management
assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31,
2006, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Management’s
assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating
effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation,
accounting policies, and our overall control environment. This assessment is
supported by testing and monitoring performed by our Finance department.

Based on our
assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of management’s
assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Our independent
registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, audited
management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and also
independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of July 31, 2006. Ernst & Young LLP has issued an
attestation report which appears on the following page of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of
Directors and Shareholders of Copart, Inc.

We have audited
management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, that Copart Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the
COSO criteria). Copart’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,
management’s assessment that Copart Inc. maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of July 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Copart
Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of July 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance
sheet of Copart Inc. as of July 31, 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for the year ended July 31, 2006 of Copart Inc. Our report dated
October 27, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

YOUNG LLP

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our
Disclosure Controls or our internal control over financial reporting will
prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
any, within Copart, Inc. have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any
system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or
deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or
procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control
system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of
the Exchange Act), during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control
over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of
Directors and Shareholders of Copart, Inc.

We have audited
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Copart Inc. as of July 31,
2006 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity
and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2006.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit.

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,
the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Copart Inc. at July 31, 2006 and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended
July 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in
Note 2 to the Financial Statements, effective August 1, 2005, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
2004), “Share-Based Payment”.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Copart’s internal control
over financial reporting as of July 31, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
October 27, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

COPART, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

July 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004

(1) Business and Basis of Presentation

Description of
Business

Copart, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“the Company”) provide vehicle
suppliers, primarily insurance companies, with a full range of services to
process and sell salvage vehicles over the Internet through the Company’s
Virtual Bidding Second Generation (“VB


”) Internet auction-style sales
technology. The Company sells principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers,
rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle dealers and exporters. Salvage
vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or
business purposes or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance
settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made. The Company offers
vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the
salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs.

Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

(2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices

Revenue
Recognition

The Company
provides a portfolio of services to its sellers and buyers that facilitate the
sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer. These services include the
ability to use its Internet sales technology and vehicle delivery, loading,
title processing, preparation and storage. The Company evaluates
multiple-element arrangements relative to the Company’s buyer and seller
agreements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

(EITF 00-21), which addresses accounting for multiple-element
arrangements, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104

Revenue Recognition

(SAB104), which
addresses revenue recognition for units of accounting.

The services
the Company provides to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle
on the seller’s behalf and under most of the Company’s current contracts,
collecting the proceeds from the buyer. The Company is not entitled to any
seller fees until the Company has collected the sales proceeds from the buyer
for the seller and, accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for seller
services after service delivery and cash collection.

In certain
cases, seller fees are not contingent upon collection of the seller proceeds
from the buyer. However, the Company determined that it is not able to separate
the services into separate units of accounting because the Company does not
have fair value for undelivered items. As a result, the Company does not
recognize seller fees until the final seller service has been delivered, which
occurs upon collection of the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller.

The Company
provides a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle, charging a separate
fee for each service. Each of these services has been assessed under the
criteria of EITF 00-21 to determine whether the Company has met the
requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multi-element
arrangement. The Company has concluded that the auction service and the
post-auction services are separate units of accounting. The fees for the
auction service are recognized upon completion of


COPART, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

July 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004

(2)  Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices

(Continued)

the

auction,
and the fees for the post-auction services are recognized upon successful
completion of those services using the residual method.

The Company
also charges buyers an annual registration fee for the right to participate in
its vehicle sales program, which is recognized ratably over the term of the
arrangement, and relist and late-payment fees which are recognized upon receipt
of payment by the buyer. No provision for returns has been established, as all
sales are final with no right of return, although the Company provides for bad
debt expense in the case of non-performance by its sellers.

Historically, the Company recorded revenue for most seller and buyer
fees upon completion of a sale. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the
Company recorded a correction of an error to account for its services in
accordance with the policy above; the effect of which was to reduce revenue, net
income and diluted earnings per share by $4.4 million, $1.5 million
and $0.01, respectively for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31,
2005.

Yard Operations

Yard operations consist primarily of operating personnel (which
includes yard management, clerical and yard employees), rent, contract vehicle
towing, insurance, fuel and equipment maintenance and repair.

General and
Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive,
accounting and data processing, sales personnel, professional services, system
maintenance and enhancements and marketing expenses.

Cash, Cash
Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with
original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash
equivalents. Short-term investments consist primarily of AAA rated auction rate
securities with readily determinable fair market values and with original
maturities in excess of three months. Auction rate securities are principally
variable rate securities tied to short-term interest rates. Auction rate
securities have interest rate resets through a modified Dutch auction, at
predetermined short-term intervals, usually every 7, 28 or 35 days. They trade
at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of
the issuer. Interest paid during a given period is based upon the interest rate
determined during the prior auction. Although these instruments are issued and
rated as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term
securities because of the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset.

Vehicle Pooling
Costs

The Company
defers, in vehicle pooling costs, certain yard operation costs associated with
vehicles consigned to and received by the Company but not sold as of the
balance sheet date. The Company quantifies the deferred costs using a
calculation that includes the number of vehicles at its facilities at the
beginning and end of the period, the number of vehicles sold during the period
and an allocation of certain yard operation costs of the period. The primary
expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs, labor,
transportation, and vehicle processing. If the allocation factors change, then
yard operation costs could

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(2)  Summary

increase or decrease correspondingly in the future. These costs are
expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost
basis.

The operating results for the year ended July 31, 2006 were
adversely affected by incremental costs, characterized as “abnormal” in Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 151: “Inventory Costs,” incurred as
a result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. These additional inventory-type costs,
characterized as “abnormal” and charged to yard operations costs, are
approximately $14.1 million for the year ended July 31, 2006. These costs
include the additional subhauling, payroll, equipment and facilities expenses
directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes and will
continue. These costs do not include normal expenses associated with the
increased unit volume created by the hurricanes, which are deferred until the
sale of the units and are recognized as vehicle pooling costs on the balance
sheet. As of July 31, 2006, approximately 28% of the incremental salvage
vehicles received as a result of the hurricanes remained unsold and in
inventory. The Company expects the majority of these vehicles will be sold
primarily in the next two quarters, provided that the Gulf Coast region does
not experience additional hurricanes or severe weather. The processing of the
hurricane vehicles has had and may continue to have a negative impact on gross
and operating margin percentages.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts receivable, which consist primarily of advance charges due
from insurance companies and the gross sales price of the vehicle due from
buyers, are recorded when billed, advanced or accrued and represent claims
against third parties that will be settled in cash. The Company estimates its
allowances for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends, the age
of outstanding receivables and existing economic conditions. If events or
changes in circumstances indicate that specific receivable balances may be
impaired, further consideration is given to the collectibility of those
balances and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. Past-due account balances
are written off when the Company’s internal collection efforts have been
unsuccessful in collecting the amount due. The Company does not have
off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.

Property and
Equipment

Property and
equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the lease terms or the useful lives of the respective assets.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of: 3 to 7 years for transportation and other equipment; 5 to 10
years for office furniture and equipment; and 15 to 40 years or life of lease,
whichever is shorter, for buildings and leasehold improvements.

Intangible
Assets

Intangible assets consist of covenants not to compete. Amortization is
provided on the straight-line basis over the life of the covenant, which ranges
from 5 to 7 years.


COPART, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

July 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004

(2)  Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices (Continued)

Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

The amounts recorded for financial instruments in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements, which include cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities approximate their fair values as of July 31, 2006 and 2005.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.

Net Income Per
Share

Basic net income per share amounts were computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income
per share amounts were computed by dividing net income by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding plus dilutive potential common shares
calculated for stock options outstanding using the treasury stock method.

Stock-Based
Compensation

The Company has
two stock-based compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 11.

Prior to August 1,
2005, the Company accounted for these plans under the recognition and
measurement provisions of Accounting Principals Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations, as
permitted by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. No stock-based employee compensation
cost was recognized for employee options granted in the Consolidated Statements
of Income for the year ended July 31, 2005 and 2004, as all such options
granted under those plans has an exercise price equal to the market value of
the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Effective August 1,
2005, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”, (“SFAS 123(R)”),
requiring it to recognize expense related to the fair value of its stock-based
compensation awards. The Company elected to use the modified prospective
transition method as permitted by SFAS 123(R) and therefore has not
restated its financial results for prior periods. Under this transition method,
stock-based compensation expense for the year ended July 31, 2006 includes
compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted prior to,
but not yet vested as of August 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair
value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123 “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation”, net of estimated forfeitures. Stock-based
compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted subsequent
to August 1, 2005 was based on the grant-date fair value estimated in
accordance with


COPART, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

July 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004

(2)  Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices (Continued)

the provisions of SFAS 123(R). For options issued subsequent to August 1,
2005, the Company recognizes compensation expense for stock option awards on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. For options
issued prior to August 1, 2005, the Company recognizes compensation
expense for stock option awards on a graded vesting basis over the requisite
service period of the award.

As a result of adopting
SFAS 123(R) on August 1, 2005, the Company’s income from continuing
operations before income taxes, income from continuing operations, and net
income for the year ended July 31, 2006 were approximately $3.5 million, $2.3 million
and $2.3 million lower respectively, than if it had continued to account for stock-based
compensation under APB 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share were
approximately $.03 and $.03 lower, respectively, than if the Company had
continued to account for stock-based compensation under Opinion 25. The
allocation of stock-based compensation of approximately $2.3 million
included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income is approximately
$1.6 million to general and administrative expenses and approximately $0.7
million to yard operations.

Prior to the
adoption of SFAS 123(R), we applied SFAS 123, amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure” (SFAS 148), which
allowed companies to apply the existing accounting rules under APB 25 and
related interpretations. In general, as the exercise price of options granted
under these plans was equal to the market price of the underlying common stock
on the grant date, no share-based employee compensation cost was recognized in
its net income. As required by SFAS 148 prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R),
we provided pro forma net income and pro forma net income per common share
disclosures for share-based awards, as if the fair-value-based method defined
in SFAS 123 had been applied.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income after tax and
net income per common share as if we had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based compensation during the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively (in thousands, except per share
amounts):

(2)  Summary

The fair value of stock-based awards was estimated using the
Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions for the year ended July 31,

Expected Term—The
Company’s expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock-based
awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on historical
experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of
the share-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee
behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its share-based awards.

Expected
Volatility—The Company uses the trading history and implied volatility of its
common stock in determining an estimated volatility factor when using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing formula to determine the fair value of options
granted.

Expected
Dividend—The Company has not declared dividends. Therefore, the Company uses a
zero value for the expected dividend value factor when using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing formula to determine the fair value of options granted.

Risk-Free
Interest Rate—The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the
Black-Scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on U.S.
Treasury zero-coupon issues with the same or substantially equivalent remaining
term.

Estimated
Forfeitures—When estimating forfeitures, the Company considers voluntary and
involuntary termination behavior as well as analysis of actual option
forfeitures.

Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were approximately
$5.4 million, $1.8 million and $5.1 million for the years ended July 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company realized an income tax benefit
of approximately $2.3 million, $1.1 million and $1.6 million from stock
option exercises during the years ended July 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), the Company presents excess tax

(2)  Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices (Continued)

Use of
Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported
consolidated results of operations during the reporting period. Estimates are
used for, but not limited to, vehicle pooling costs, self-insured reserves,
allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, income taxes, revenue recognition,
share-based compensation and long-lived assets. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Business
Combinations and Goodwill

The Company
accounts for business combinations and goodwill according to SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations,” and SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be
used for all business combinations and that certain acquired intangible assets
be recognized as assets apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 provides that
goodwill should not be amortized but instead should be tested for impairment
annually at the reporting unit level. The Company’s annual impairment test was
performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The results of this test
indicated that goodwill was not impaired. Refer to Note 3 for additional
discussion.

The change in carrying amount of goodwill is as follows (in thousands)

Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized
is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
fair market value.

Advertising

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses
were $1.8 million, $2.8 million and $2.0 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Retained
Insurance Liabilities

The Company is partially self-insured for certain losses related to
medical, general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability. The
Company’s liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims
incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not
discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and
actuarial estimates. While the Company believes these estimates are reasonable
based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the
severity of claims and medical cost inflation, differ from the Company’s
estimates, the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows
could be impacted.

Reclassifications

Certain previous year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2006. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should
recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain
tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return
(including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular
jurisdiction). Under FIN 48, the financial statements will reflect expected
future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities’
full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts, but without considering
time values. The Company will assess all material open positions in all tax
jurisdictions as of the adoption date and determine the appropriate amount of
tax benefits that are recognizable under FIN 48. Any difference between the
amounts previously recognized and the benefit determined under the new
guidance, including changes in accrued interest and penalties will be recorded
on the date of adoption. The Company has not yet determined the exact impact
the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our results of operations and financial
position when adopted on August 1, 2007.

(3) Discontinued Operations and Goodwill Impairment

During fiscal
2006, the Company adopted a formal plan to discontinue the operations of its
public auction business Motors Auction Group (“MAG”) and dispose of or convert
the related assets. The MAG yards to be converted into salvage facilities will
continue to be included in the results of continuing operations on the income
statements.

Under
SFAS No 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” goodwill is subject
to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value-based
test or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present. The
discontinuation of an operating segment is one of those indicators.
Accordingly, goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance with the
provisions


COPART, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

July 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004

(3) Discontinued Operations and Goodwill Impairment

(Continued)

of SFAS No. 142 during the second quarter of 2006. The
Company used a combination of valuation techniques, which included
consideration of market-based approaches and an income approach, in determining
the fair value of the Company’s applicable reporting unit in the interim
impairment test of goodwill.

The impairment
test indicated that the carrying value of the MAG goodwill exceeded its implied
fair value. The corresponding write-down of goodwill of $21.8 million to its
fair value was reported as a component of discontinued operations in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company also determined
that the value of the remaining MAG covenants not to compete was impaired and
recorded an impairment expense in the amount of $0.5 million. This write-down
of covenants not to compete is also reported as a component of discontinued
operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

During the
second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company sold the business and related assets
of one of the MAG locations for approximately $0.1 million. During the third
quarter, the Company sold the business and related assets including the real
estate of one of the MAG locations. The Company received a $12 million
promissory note from the buyer as purchase consideration. The promissory note
bears interest at 7% per annum. Interest only payments on the note are due
monthly until maturity on May 28, 2011, at which time the balance of the
note is due in full. The note receivable is collateralized by the real estate
and is personally guaranteed by the buyer. The consideration was allocated to
the real estate, based on an appraisal, and to the business in proportion to
their estimated fair values. The portion of the consideration allocated to the
real estate sale totaled $7.1 million. The Company deferred a gain on the sale
of the real estate of approximately $2.5 million that will be recognized upon
payment of the principal balance of the note receivable. The remaining
consideration of $4.9 million is allocated to the sale of the business. The
Company recognized a gain on the sale of the business of approximately $3.0
million, which is included in the results of the discontinued operations. During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company sold the business and related
assets excluding the real estate of another MAG location. The Company received
a $1.2 million promissory note and $0.2 million in cash from the buyer as
purchase consideration. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of the
business of approximately $1.3 million which is included in the results of
discontinued operations. As of July 31, 2006, no MAG locations remain.
Three of the original six MAG locations were sold and three are being converted
into salvage facilities.

(4) Acquisitions

Fiscal 2006
Transactions

During fiscal 2006, the Company made the following three acquisitions:
Auto Auction Associates of Montana, Inc.; Heartland Insurance Pool, Inc.
and Central Penn Sales, LLC. These three companies consisted of seven separate
facilities. The consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of $23.0
million in cash. The acquired net assets consisted of accounts and advances
receivable, vehicle pooling costs, fixed assets, land, buildings, goodwill, and
covenants not to compete. The acquisitions were accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting, and the operating results subsequent to the
acquisition dates are included in the Company’s consolidated statements of
income. These new facilities contributed $6.9 million of revenues during fiscal
2006. The excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net
identifiable assets acquired of $19.0 million has been recorded as goodwill.
The Company estimates the entire goodwill balance relating to these
acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes. In addition, the Company paid
$1.3 million for covenants not to compete relating to these acquisitions, which
are being amortized over five to seven years. In conjunction with the Central
Penn Sales acquisition, the Company entered into leases for the use of these
facilities at fair value.

Fiscal 2005
Transactions

During fiscal 2005, the Company made the following two acquisitions:
Kentucky Auto Salvage Pool, Inc. (“KASP”) of Lexington, Kentucky and
Insurance Auctions of Missouri, Inc. of Columbia, Missouri. The
consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of $4.5 million in cash.
The acquired net assets consisted of accounts and advances receivable, vehicle
pooling costs, fixed assets, land, buildings, goodwill, and covenants not to
compete. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting, and the operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates are
included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. These new
facilities contributed $0.7 million of revenues during fiscal 2005. The excess
of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net identifiable assets
acquired of $3.7 million has been recorded as goodwill. The Company estimates
the entire goodwill balance relating to these acquisitions will be deductible
for tax purposes. In addition, the Company paid $0.3 million for covenants not
to compete relating to these acquisitions, which are being amortized over five
to seven years. In conjunction with the Lexington, Kentucky and Columbia,
Missouri, acquisitions, the Company entered into leases for the use of these
facilities at fair value.

Fiscal 2004
Transactions

During fiscal
2004, the Company made the following four acquisitions: Brasher’s Northwest
Auto Auction, Inc. of Eugene, Oregon; Spooner Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a
Insured Salvage Pool, of Reno, Nevada; Joe Horisk Salvage Pool Systems of Ohio,
of Cleveland, Ohio and Alaska Towing and Wrecking of Anchorage, Alaska. The
consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of $4.7 million in cash.
The acquired net assets consisted of accounts and advances receivable, vehicle
pooling costs, fixed assets, land, buildings, goodwill, and covenants not to
compete. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting, and the operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates are
included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. These new
facilities contributed $1.4 million of revenues during fiscal 2004. The excess
of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net identifiable assets
acquired of $3.6 million has been recorded as goodwill. The Company estimates
the entire goodwill balance relating to these acquisitions will be deductible
for tax purposes. In addition, the

Company paid $0.2 million for covenants not to compete relating to
these acquisitions, which are being amortized over five years. In conjunction
with the Eugene, Oregon; Reno, Nevada and Anchorage, Alaska acquisitions, the
Company entered into leases for the use of these facilities at fair value.

Pro forma financial information for the 2006, 2005 and 2004
acquisitions does not result in a significant change from actual results.

(5) Short-term
Investments

Short-term
investments consist primarily of AAA rated auction rate securities with readily
determinable fair market values and with original maturities in excess of three
months. Auction rate securities are principally variable rate securities tied
to short-term interest rates. Auction rate securities have interest rate resets
through a modified Dutch auction, at predetermined short-term intervals,
usually every 7, 28 or 35 days. They trade at par and are callable at par on
any interest payment date at the option of the issuer. Interest paid during a given
period is based upon the interest rate determined during the prior auction.
Although these instruments are issued and rated as long-term securities, they
are priced and traded as short-term securities because of the liquidity
provided through the interest rate reset.

The Company has
classified its entire investment portfolio as available-for-sale. The Company
views its available-for-sale securities as available for use in its current
operations. Accordingly, the Company has classified all investments as short-term,
even though the stated maturity may be one year or more beyond the current
balance sheet date. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value,
with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of Shareholders’
Equity and Comprehensive Income. Unrealized losses are charged against income
when a decline in the fair market value of an individual security is determined
to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on investments are
included in interest income.

liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of
the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is
established based upon analysis of historical data, including the severity of
or frequency of claims, actuarial estimates and is reviewed periodically by
management to ensure that the liability is appropriate.

(10) Long-Term Debt

On February 23, 2001, the Company entered into a credit facility
with its existing banking syndicate. The facility provided by Wells Fargo Bank,
Fleet National Bank and U.S. Bank National Association consisted of an
unsecured revolving reducing line of credit in the amount of approximately
$10.6 million. On May 8, 2006, the line of credit was reduced to zero and
the line of credit was terminated in accordance with its terms.

(11) Shareholders’ Equity

General

The Company has authorized the issuance of 180 million shares of common
stock, no par value of which approximately 90.4 million shares are issued
and outstanding at July 31, 2006. The Company has authorized the issuance
of 5 million shares of preferred stock, no par value, none of which are issued
or outstanding at July 31, 2006.

(11) Shareholders’ Equity (Continued)

Stock Repurchase

In February 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the
Company to repurchase up to 9 million shares of its common stock. The
repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in
the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. No time limit has been
placed on the duration of the share repurchase program. The repurchases will be
made at such times and in such amounts as the Company deems appropriate and may
be discontinued at any time. For the year ended July 31, 2006, the Company
repurchased 366,000 shares at a weighted average price of $24.24. For the year
ended July 31, 2005, the Company did not repurchase any shares. For the
year  ended July 31, 2004, the Company
repurchased a total of 977,100 shares at a weighted average price of $10.97 per
share. The total number of shares repurchased under the program as of July 31,
2006 is approximately 4.0 million, leaving approximately 5.0 million available
under the repurchase program.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Copart, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) provides
for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1.5 million shares of common stock of
the Company by employees pursuant to the terms of the ESPP. The Company’s ESPP
was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by the shareholders in 1994.
The ESPP was amended and restated in 2003 and again approved by the
shareholders. Under the ESPP, employees of the Company who elect to participate
have the right to purchase common stock at a 15 percent discount from the
lower of the market value of the common stock at the beginning or the end of
each six month offering period. The ESPP permits an enrolled employee to make
contributions to purchase shares of common stock by having withheld from their
salary an amount up to 10 percent of their compensation (which amount may
be increased from time to time by the Company but may not exceed 15% of
compensation). No employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth of common stock
(calculated at the time the purchase right is granted) in any calendar year.
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the ESPP. The
number of shares of common stock issued pursuant to the ESPP during each of
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 83,765, 68,633 and 135,735, respectively.

Stock Options

In December 2001,
the Company adopted the Copart, Inc. 2001 Stock Option Plan (“Plan”),
presently covering an aggregate of 4.5 million shares of the Company’s common
stock. The Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees
and non-qualified stock options to employees, officers, directors and
consultants at prices not less than 100% and 85% of the fair market value for
incentive and non-qualified stock options, respectively, as determined by the
Board of Directors at the grant date. Incentive and non-qualified stock options
may have terms of up to ten years and vest over periods determined by the Board
of Directors. Options generally vest ratably over a five-year period. The Plan
replaced the Company’s 1992 Stock Option Plan (“1992 Plan”), which expired in August 2002.

As required by
SFAS 123(R), the Company made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is
recognizing compensation cost only for those equity awards expected to vest.

As of July 31,
2006, the total compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards
granted to employees under the Company’s stock option plans but not yet
recognized was $8.3 million, net of estimated forfeitures. This cost will be amortized

The Company’s
ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate
future taxable income. Accordingly, the Company has established a valuation
allowance in taxable jurisdictions where the utilization of the tax assets are
uncertain. Additional timing differences or future tax losses may occur which
could warrant a need for establishing additional valuation allowances against
certain deferred tax assets.

The Company is
under routine income tax audits in two states for tax years between 2001 and
2005. Management believes that adequate amounts have been provided for any
adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations.

In fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004, the Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $2.3
million, $1.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, upon the exercise of
certain stock options which is reflected in shareholders’ equity.

The valuation
allowance for the years ended July 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately
$0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, which is a net increase of $0.2
million.

The Company has a Canadian net operating loss of approximately $1.4
million, most of which expires between 2010 and 2013. In addition, the Company
also has various state net operating losses of $12.0 million, which expire
between 2016 and 2026.

(13) Net Income Per Share

There were no adjustments to net income in
calculating diluted net income per share. The table below reconciles weighted

included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’
exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares.

(Continued)

Judgment was granted on December 8, 2004, dismissing the class
claim element of the lawsuit. On August 9, 2006, Plaintiff’s motion for
summary judgment was denied. A trial date has not been set. The Company
believes the claim is without merit, and the Company intends to continue to
defend this lawsuit vigorously.

On September 16,
2005, Richard M. Gray filed suit against Copart and A. Safrin, in the State
Court for the County of Chatham, State of Georgia, alleging a class action for
unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by the Company, and related
claims. Relief sought included class certification, damages, fees, costs and
expenses. The Company has filed a motion for summary judgment, the hearing for
which has not been scheduled. The Company believes the claim is without merit,
and intends to continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously.

On July 28,
2006, Foreign Car Sales and Service LLC filed suit against Copart in the United
States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana alleging antitrust
violations and unfair trade practices. Relief sought is class certification,
damages, fees, costs and expenses. Plaintiff is in pro per and is demanding a
total award of the now current value of 51% of Copart issued stock. The Company
believes the claim is without merit, and intends to defend the lawsuit
vigorously.

On August 7,
2006, Kimberly and Jason Green filed suit against Copart in the Superior Court
of the State of California, County of Sacramento, making allegations pursuant
to a California consumer protection statute similar to a class action for
unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by the Company, and related
claims. Relief sought included class certification, damages, fees, costs and
expenses. The Company filed an answer on September 1, 2006 denying the
claim. The Company believes the claim is without merit, and the Company intends
to continue to defend this lawsuit vigorously.

On June 10,
2005, Manheim Services Corp. filed suit against Copart, Inc. in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division,
alleging infringement of Manheim’s assigned patent (U.S. Patent No. 5,774,873).
Relief sought included a patent infringement judgment, an injunction
prohibiting the Company from using any infringing product or service (including
VB


),
damages, fees, costs and expenses. On August 3, 2005, the Company
denied the claim and asserted counterclaims based on violations of antitrust
laws and common-law tortuous interference

(the “Competition
Claims”). On February 10, 2006, the District Court denied Manheim’s motion to
bifurcate the Competition Claims and stayed discovery on the Competition Claims
through April 13, 2006. Additionally, on February 6, 2006, Manheim requested
the Court to grant it leave to assert its additional alleged claims of
infringement by the Company of Manheim’s assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,006,201,
The Court denied this request on May 30, 2006. On

June 27,
2006, Manheim Services Corp dismissed all claims against the Company alleging
patent infringement and the Company dismissed all of its counterclaims against
Manheim Services Corp alleging antitrust violations. The matter was resolved
amicably with express denials of liability from both parties.

The Company provides for costs relating to these matters when a loss is
probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome
of these matters on the Company’s future results of operations cannot be
predicted because any such effect depends on future results of operations, the
amount and timing of the resolution of such matters. The Company believes that
any ultimate liability will not have a material effect on its financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the amount of the liabilities
associated with these claims, if any, cannot be determined with certainty.

(16) Related Party Transactions

The Company leases certain of its facilities from officers and/or
directors of the Company under various lease agreements. Rental payments under
these leases aggregated approximately $0.5 million for the fiscal years ended July 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, and expire on various dates through 2009. The Company
leases certain of its facilities from other employees of the Company under
various lease agreements. Rental payments under these leases aggregated
approximately $0.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million for the fiscal
years ended July 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

(17) Employee Benefit Plan

The Company sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering
its eligible employees. The plan is available to all employees who meet minimum
age and service requirements and provides employees with tax deferred salary
deductions and alternative investment options. The Company matches 10% of employee
contributions up to 15% of employee salary deferral. The Company recognized an
expense of approximately $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million for
each of the years ended July 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 related to this plan.

(18) Investment in Unconsolidated Entity

During the year ended July 31, 2006, the Company invested
approximately $8.9 million for a 50% equity interest in a limited liability
corporation (the “LLC”) of which approximately $3.0 million was contributed
during the three months ended October 31, 2005 and approximately $5.9
million was contributed during the three months ended January 31, 2006.
The Company has no further contractual funding commitment. Based on the Company’s
evaluation of the LLC and related agreements, management believes the LLC does
not constitute a Variable Interest Entity as defined in FASB Interpretation
No.46,

“

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities”. As a result, the Company’s investment has been accounted
for under the equity method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18,
“The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.”

(19) Noncash Financing and Investing Activities

In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company received 4,378, 42,071 and 983
shares of common stock, respectively as payment for the exercise of 8,678,
95,106 and 9,000 shares of common stock under the 1992 Stock Option Plan,
respectively. The Company retired these shares upon receipt.
