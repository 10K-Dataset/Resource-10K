PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

Copart, Inc. is a leading provider of salvage vehicle auction services in the United States.

We
provide vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance companies, with a full range of services to process and sell salvage vehicles through auctions, principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers,
rebuilders, repair licensees and used vehicle dealers. Salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an
insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made. We offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle auction process and minimize
administrative and processing costs. We generate revenues primarily from auction fees paid by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage.

We
were organized as a California corporation in 1982 and became a public company in 1994. As of July 31, 2001, we had grown from 12 auction facilities in northern California in 1994 to 84
auction facilities located in 37 states, and had approximately 2,078 full-time employees. Our principal executive offices are located at 5500 E. Second Street, Benicia, California 94510,
and our telephone number at that address is (707) 748-5000.

During
the fiscal year ending July 31, 2001, we acquired three additional salvage vehicle auction facilities and opened five new facilities. Our acquisitions included facilities in Chatham,
Virginia; Shreveport, Louisiana and Mount Morris, Pennsylvania. We opened new salvage vehicle auction sites in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Chicago Heights, Illinois; Martinez, California; Lawrenceburg,
Kentucky and New Orleans, Louisiana.

Not
only have we grown our business through a combination of acquisitions and the development of new facilities but also over the years we have increased our buyer base and implemented additional
value-added services for both buyers and suppliers. Our gross proceeds have grown from $144 million in fiscal year 1994 to over $1 billion in fiscal year 2001. For fiscal year 2001, our
revenues were $254 million and our operating income was $68 million.

We
believe that we offer the highest level of service in the salvage vehicle auction industry and have established our leading market position as follows:

•

by
providing national coverage that facilitates supplier access to buyers across the country, reduces towing and third-party storage expenses, offers a
local presence for vehicle inspection stations, and prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters by specially-trained teams;

•

by
providing a comprehensive range of customer services that include flexible vehicle payment programs, merchandising services, efficient title processing,
timely pick-up and delivery of vehicles and electronic video auctions in certain geographic areas that are subject to severe weather;

•

by
establishing and efficiently integrating new facilities and acquisitions; and

•

by
applying technology to enhance operating efficiency through Internet bidding, web-based order processing, salvage value quotes, electronic
communication with buyers and sellers, vehicle imaging and an electronic used vehicle parts locator service.

In
addition to our primary salvage vehicle auction business, as of July 31, 2001, we owned two public automobile auction facilities located in Detroit, Michigan and Chesapeake, Virginia, where
we auction vehicles directly to the public and


automobile dealers on behalf of banks, leasing or financing companies, automobile dealers and repossession companies. In April 2001, we announced the creation of Motors Auction
Group, Inc. as a wholly-owned subsidiary in which we will operate our public automobile auction business.

Industry Overview

The salvage vehicle auction industry provides an outlet for salvage vehicle suppliers to liquidate total loss vehicles. Salvage vehicle auction companies generally auction
salvage vehicles on consignment for a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price. On occasion, salvage auction companies may purchase vehicles from vehicle suppliers at a formula price, based on a
percentage of the vehicles' estimated pre-loss value ("actual cash value") and auction the vehicles for their own account. Salvage vehicle auction companies typically operate from one or
more salvage facilities where vehicles are processed, stored and auctioned.

Although
there are other suppliers of salvage vehicles, such as financial institutions, vehicle leasing companies, automobile rental companies and automobile dealers, the primary source of salvage
vehicles is insurance companies.

Over
the last several years, automobile manufacturers have begun incorporating certain standard features that increase passenger safety, including unibody construction, passenger safety cages with
surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts, plastic components, airbags and computer systems. We believe that one effect of these features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more likely
to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes, resulting in an increasing supply of total loss salvage vehicles in the future.*

The
primary buyers of salvage vehicles are vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees and used vehicle dealers. Vehicle dismantlers, which we believe are the largest group of salvage vehicle
buyers, either dismantle a vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders, used vehicle dealers or the public. Vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally
purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell. Used vehicle dealers purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles for resale.

Following
an accident involving an insured vehicle, the damaged vehicle is generally towed to a towing company or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage pending insurance company examination.
The vehicle is inspected by the insurance company's adjuster, who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle's mileage, options and condition in
order to estimate its actual cash value. The adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total loss based upon the adjuster's estimate of repair costs and the
vehicle's salvage value, as well as customer service considerations. If the cost of repair is greater than the actual cash value less the estimated salvage value, the insurance company generally will
classify the vehicle as a total loss. The insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a salvage vehicle auction company, settle with the insured vehicle owner and receive title to the
vehicle.

In
disposing of a salvage vehicle, a vehicle supplier typically assigns the vehicle to a salvage vehicle auction company. The primary factors that vehicle suppliers consider when selecting a salvage
vehicle auction company include:

•

the
anticipated percentage return on salvage (e.g., gross salvage proceeds, minus vehicle handling and selling expenses, divided by the actual cash value);
and

•

the
services provided by the salvage vehicle auction company and the degree to which such services reduce administrative costs and expenses.

Upon
receipt of the pick-up order, a vehicle transport company arranges for the transport of a vehicle to a vehicle auction facility. As a service to the vehicle supplier, the salvage
vehicle auction company will customarily pay advance charges (reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle suppliers) to obtain the subject vehicle's release from a towing company or vehicle repair
facility. Typically, advance charges paid on behalf of the vehicle supplier are recovered upon sale of the salvage vehicle.

The
vehicle then remains in storage until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state's motor vehicle
regulatory agency (the "DMV"). Total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only after obtaining a salvage certificate from the DMV. Upon receipt of the appropriate documentation from the DMV, which
is generally received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pick-up, the vehicle is auctioned. Vehicles are sold primarily through weekly or biweekly live auctions.


Operating and Growth Strategy

Our growth strategy is to increase our revenues and profitability by, among other things, (i) acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle auction facilities in key
markets, (ii) pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements, (iii) expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers, including data collection and management systems,
(iv) developing and expanding public automobile auction facilities, (v) implementing our buyer fee structure, and (vi) initiating our merchandising procedures. In addition, we
attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities through, among other things, implementing our operational procedures, integrating our management information systems and, when
necessary, redeploying personnel.

As
part of our overall expansion strategy, our objective is to increase our sales, operating profits and market share in the vehicle auction industry. To implement our growth strategy, we intend to
continue to do the following:

Acquire and Develop New Salvage Vehicle Auction Facilities in Key Markets

Due to the fragmented nature of the salvage vehicle auction business, we believe that numerous acquisition opportunities exist throughout the United States. Our strategy is to
offer integrated services to vehicle suppliers on a national or regional basis by acquiring or developing salvage facilities in new and existing markets. From 1994 through July 31, 2001, we
added 72 salvage vehicle auction facilities, comprised of 24 new facilities and 48 acquisitions. We integrate our new acquisitions into our national network and capitalize on certain operating
efficiencies resulting from, among other things, the reduction of duplicative overhead and the implementation of our operating procedures.

The
following chart sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened since the beginning of fiscal year 1999 through July 31, 2001.

Pursue National and Regional Vehicle Supply Agreements

Our broad national presence enhances our ability to enter into local, regional or national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers. We currently have national contracts with
approximately 60 of our vehicle suppliers. We actively seek to establish national and regional supply agreements with insurance companies by promoting our ability to achieve high net returns and
broader access to buyers through our national coverage and electronic commerce capabilities. By utilizing our existing insurance company supplier relationships, we are able to build new supplier
relationships and pursue additional supply agreements in existing and new markets.

Expand Our Service Offerings to Suppliers and Buyers

Over the past several years, we have expanded our available service offerings to vehicle suppliers and buyers. The primary focus of these new service offerings is to maximize
returns to our suppliers and maximize product value to our buyers. Recent service enhancements include, for our suppliers, real-time access to sales data over the Internet and, for our
buyers, the ability to bid on vehicles via the Internet up to 14 days prior to the auction date. We plan to continue to refine and expand our services, including offering software that can
assist our suppliers in expediting claims and salvage management tools that help suppliers integrate their systems with our own.

Develop and Expand Public Automobile Auction Facilities

The public automobile auction industry is highly fragmented, consisting primarily of small local operations, and we believe that it currently presents opportunities for
consolidation. To expand our geographic reach, we plan to acquire or develop new public automobile auction facilities as favorable opportunities arise. Our public automobile auctions allow the general
public to bid via the Internet or at live auctions on a wide range of end-of-lease vehicles, repossessed vehicles, dealer trade-ins and vehicles that we offer for
sale on a consignment basis.

In
connection with the development of Motors Auction Group, Inc., we have established the systems, infrastructure, and management required to begin expanding our public automobile auction
business. To date, we have acquired three facilities and launched our public automobile auction website. We believe that our combination of experience and expertise, along with our established
reputation for acquiring and integrating salvage vehicle auction operations, gives us the relevant experience withwhich to pursue future acquisitions and development of public automobile auction
facilities.*

Our Competitive Advantages

We believe that the following attributes and the services that we offer position us to take advantage of many opportunities in the salvage vehicle auction industry.

National Coverage and Ability to Respond on a National Scale

Since our inception in 1982, we have expanded from a single facility in Vallejo, California to an integrated network of 84 facilities located in 37 states as of July 31,
2001. We are able to offer integrated services on a national basis to our vehicle suppliers, which allows us to respond to the needs of our suppliers and buyers with maximum efficiency. Our national
coverage provides our suppliers with key advantages, including:

•

a
reduction in administrative time and effort;

•

a
reduction in overall vehicle towing costs;

•

convenient
local facilities;

•

improved
access to buyers throughout the country; and

•

a
prompt response in the event of a natural disaster or other catastrophe.

Value-Added Services

We believe that our services and experience provide us competitive advantages in our industry, specifically:

•

the
operation of a fleet of over 500 trucks which enables us to pick up most of our suppliers' vehicles within 24 hours, reducing overall costs to
our suppliers;


•

Internet
bidding and electronic video auctions, which enhance the competitive bidding process;

•

e-mail
notifications to potential buyers of salvage vehicles that match desired characteristics;

•

sophisticated
vehicle processing at auction sites, including five-view digital imaging of each vehicle and the scanning of each vehicle's title
and other significant documents such as body shop invoices, all of which are available from us through the Internet; and

•

CoPartfinder,
our Internet-based used vehicle parts locator that provides vehicle dismantlers with greater resale opportunities for their salvage
purchases.

Proven Ability to Acquire and Integrate Acquisitions

We have a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating salvage vehicle auction facilities. Since becoming a public company in 1994, we have completed 48
acquisitions in 32 states. As part of our acquisition and integration strategy, we seek to:

•

strengthen
our national network and access new markets;

•

utilize
our existing corporate and technology infrastructure over a larger base of operations; and

•

introduce
our comprehensive services and operational expertise.

We
strive to integrate all new facilities into our existing national network without disruption of service to vehicle suppliers. We work with new suppliers to implement our fee structures and new
service programs. We typically retain existing employees at acquired facilities in order to gain knowledge about, and respond to, the local market. We also assign a special integration team to help
convert newly acquired facilities to our own management information and proprietary software systems, enabling us to ensure a smooth and consistent transition to our business operating and auction
systems.

Application of Technology to Enhance and Expand Business

We have developed management information and proprietary software systems that allow us to deliver a fully integrated service offering. Our proprietary software programs
provide vehicle suppliers with on-line access to data and reports regarding their salvage vehicles being processed at any of our facilities. This technology allows vehicle suppliers to
monitor each stage of our salvage vehicle auction process, from pick up to auction and settlement by the buyer. Our full range of Internet services allows us to expedite each stage of the salvage
vehicle auction process and minimizes the administrative and processing costs for us as well as our suppliers. We believe that our integrated technology systems generate improved capacity and
financial returns for our clients, resulting in high client retention, and allow us to expand our national supply contracts.

Our Service Offerings

We offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle auction process, maximize proceeds and minimize costs to our suppliers.

On-line Supplier Access

Through Copart Access, our Internet-based service for vehicle suppliers, we enable suppliers to assign vehicles for auction, check auction calendars, view vehicle images and
history, view and reprint body shop invoices and towing receipts and view the historical performance of the vehicles sold for that supplier at our auctions.

Salvage Estimation Services

We offer Copart ProQuote, a proprietary service that assists suppliers in the vehicle claims evaluation process by providing on-line salvage value estimates, which
helps suppliers determine whether to repair a particular vehicle or deem it a total loss.


Transportation Services

We operate a fleet of over 500 trucks which enables us to pick up most of our suppliers' vehicles within 24 hours. To supplement our own fleet of trucks, we also
maintain contracts with third-party vehicle transport companies for our facilities. Our national network and transportation capabilities provide cost and time savings to our vehicle suppliers and
enable us to ensure on-time vehicle pick up and prompt response to catastrophes and natural disasters.

Vehicle Inspection Stations

We offer certain of our major insurance company suppliers office and yard space to house vehicle inspection stations on-site at our auction facilities. We have over
30 vehicle inspection stations at our facilities nationwide. An on-site vehicle inspection station provides our insurance company suppliers a central location to inspect potential total
loss vehicles, which reduces storage charges that otherwise may be incurred at the initial storage or repair facility.

On-Demand Reporting

We provide vehicle suppliers with on-demand reports on-line or via fax or e-mail that summarize data on salvage vehicles that we process for
the particular supplier. These reports track our vehicle suppliers' gross and net returns on each vehicle, service charges, and other data that enable our vehicle suppliers to more easily administer
and monitor the salvage vehicle disposition process.

DMV Processing

We have extensive expertise in DMV document and title processing for salvage vehicles. We have developed a computer system which provides a direct link to the DMV computer
systems of several states. This allows us to expedite the processing of vehicle title paperwork. By facilitating the title acquisition from the insured vehicle owner, we effectively shorten the time
period between the auction of salvage vehicles and when our vehicle suppliers receive the proceeds from their sales.

Flexible Vehicle Processing Programs

At the election of the vehicle supplier, we auction vehicles pursuant to our Percentage Incentive Program consignment basis or on a fixed fee consignment basis.

Percentage Fee Consignment.

Our Percentage Incentive Program ("PIP") is an innovative processing program designed to broadly serve the
needs of vehicle suppliers. Under PIP, we agree to sell at auction all of the salvage vehicles of a vehicle supplier in a specified market for a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price.
Because our revenues under PIP are directly linked to the vehicle's auction price, we have an incentive to actively merchandise those vehicles to maximize the net return on salvage vehicles. We
provide the vehicle supplier, at our expense, with transport of the vehicle to our nearest facility, storage for up to 90 days and DMV document and title processing. In addition, we provide
merchandising services such as covering or taping openings to protect vehicle interiors from weather, washing vehicle exteriors, vacuuming vehicle interiors, cleaning and polishing dashboards and
tires, making keys for driveable vehicles and operating "drive-through" sales auctions of driveable vehicles. We believe our merchandising efforts increase the sales prices of salvage vehicles,
thereby increasing the return on salvage vehicles to both vehicle suppliers and us. In fiscal year 2001, we processed approximately 62% of all our salvage vehicles under PIP.

Fixed Fee Consignment.

Under our fixed fee consignment program, we sell vehicles for a fixed consignment fee, generally $50 to $150 per
vehicle. Although sometimes included in the consignment fee, we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility, storage of the vehicle, and other incidental
costs. Approximately 38% of all salvage vehicles we processed in fiscal year 2001 were processed under the fixed fee consignment program.

Buyer Network

We maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling, rebuilding, repair and resale businesses. Our database includes each
buyer's vehicle preference and purchasing history. This data enables us to notify via e-mail prospective buyers throughout the region or country of salvage vehicles available for bidding
that


match their vehicle preferences. Listings of salvage vehicles to be auctioned on a particular day and location are also made available on the Internet.

Auction Process

We offer a flexible and unique auction process designed to maximize the sale prices of the vehicles that we auction. Our live auction process is enhanced by the systems that we
have developed which permit Internet bidding from prospective buyers to be incorporated into the regular auction process. Prospective buyers are allowed to remotely participate in the auction process
by submitting silent bids on-line up to 14 days prior to the actual live auction. The combined use of the Internet bids and live bids helps to ensure that we receive the highest
possible price for each vehicle sold. Currently, approximately 43% of the vehicles that we auction receive an Internet bid prior to the actual auction day.

We
have also developed other unique systems which we have implemented at some of our facilities that are located in areas which are subject to severe weather conditions. These systems allow such
facilities to conduct our regular live auction process as Electronic Video Auctions ("EVAs"). At EVAs, buyers assemble indoors (rather than outdoors in the storage yards) and bid on vehicles as they
are displayed on video monitors. EVAs, like all of our other auctions, integrate live bids with previously submitted on-line remote bids. The EVA process helps to ensure higher buyer
turn-out and participation rates, thereby achieving maximum sales prices and value for our vehicle suppliers. As of July 31, 2001, EVA's were being used at approximately 23 of our
facilities.

CoPartfinder

CoPartfinder is our unique Internet "search engine" that enables users to locate specific vehicle parts quickly and efficiently. CoPartfinder is open to the public through its
own website. On CoPartfinder, we list vehicles recently sold at our auctions and identify the purchasers which allows vehicle dismantlers and other resellers to streamline their parts sale process and
access a large pool of potential buyers. At this time, we charge a nominal per-search fee to potential parts buyers, who can use CoPartfinder to search for specific vehicle makes and
models and view digital images of vehicles that meet their requirements. Once a specific parts supplier is identified for a specific part requirement, buyers have the option to call, fax,
e-mail or instantly message the dismantler/supplier for additional information. We believe that CoPartfinder provides an incentive for vehicle dismantlers and other resellers to purchase
their salvage vehicles through our auction process.

Supply Arrangements and Supplier Marketing

We currently obtain salvage vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle suppliers. In fiscal year 2001, vehicles supplied by our two largest suppliers accounted for
approximately 22% of our revenues. No other supplier accounted for more than 4% of our revenues. Of the total number of vehicles that we processed in fiscal year 2001, we obtained approximately
88% from insurance company suppliers. Our arrangements with our suppliers are either written or oral agreements that are typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days
notice.

We
typically contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other vehicle suppliers. The agreements are customized to each vehicle supplier's particular needs and often provide
for the disposition of different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods. Our contracts or arrangements generally provide that we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by
the vehicle supplier in a designated geographic area.

We
market our services to vehicle suppliers through an in-house sales force that utilizes a variety of sales techniques, including targeted mailing of our sales literature, telemarketing,
follow-up personal sales calls, and participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions. Based upon our historical data on salvage vehicles and vehicle information
supplied by vehicle suppliers, our marketing personnel will provide vehicle suppliers with detailed analysis of the net return on salvage vehicles and a proposal setting forth ways in which we believe
that we can improve net returns on salvage vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses.

Buyers

We maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling, rebuilding, repair and resale businesses. We believe that we have
established a broad buyer base by providing buyers of salvage vehicles


with a variety of programs and services. To gain admission to one of our auctions and become a registered buyer, prospective buyers must first pay an initial registration fee and an annual fee,
provide requested personal and business information and have, in most states, a vehicle dismantler's, dealer's, resale or repair license. Registration entitles a buyer to transact business at any of
our auctions subject to local licensing and permitting requirements. A buyer may also bring guests to an auction for a fee. Strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous bids that
would invalidate an auction. We market to buyers on the Internet and via e-mail notifications, sales notices, telemarketing and participation in trade show events. In addition, we have
initiated programs specifically designed to address the needs of our wholesale and high volume buyers, including providing streamlined paperwork processing, simplified payment procedures and
personalized customer services. No single buyer accounted for more than two percent of our gross proceeds in fiscal year 2001.

Competition

We face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles. We believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction companies
and vehicle dismantlers. These national, regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle suppliers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than
ours. The largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers include the ADESA Corporation, Auction Broadcasting Company, Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc., Manheim Auctions and SADISCO. The largest
national dismantlers include Greenleaf, a subsidiary of Ford Motor Company, and LKQ Corporation. These national dismantlers, in addition to
trade groups of dismantlers such as the American Recycling Association and the United Recyclers Group, purchase salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies, thereby bypassing auction companies
entirely, including us.

Management Information Systems

Our primary management information system consists of an expandable, integrated IBM AS/400 mainframe computer system, integrated computer interfaces and proprietary business
operating software that we developed and which tracks salvage vehicles throughout the auction process. We call this proprietary business operating software the Copart Auction System ("CAS") and have
implemented CAS at all of our salvage auction facilities. In addition, we have integrated our mainframe computer system with Internet and Intranet systems in order to provide secure access to CAS data
and images in a variety of formats. We also host our own Intranet and Internet platforms.

Employees

As of July 31, 2001, we had approximately 2,078 full-time employees, of whom approximately 178 were engaged in general and administrative functions and
approximately 1,900 were engaged in yard and fleet operations. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and believe that our relationships with our employees are good.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment. In the salvage vehicle auction industry, large numbers of wrecked
vehicles are stored at auction facilities and, during that time, spills of fuel, motor oils and other fluids may occur, resulting in soil, surface water or groundwater contamination. Certain of our
facilities store petroleum products and other hazardous materials in above-ground containment tanks and some of our facilities generate waste materials such as solvents or used oils that must be
disposed of as non-hazardous or hazardous waste, as appropriate. We have implemented procedures to reduce the amount of soil contamination that may occur at our facilities, and we have
initiated safety programs and training of personnel on the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental regulations
and we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to remain in environmental compliance.*


In connection with the acquisition of our Dallas, Texas facility in 1994, we set aside $3.0 million to cover the costs of environmental remediation, stabilization and related consulting
expenses for a six-acre portion of the facility that contained elevated levels of lead due to the activities of the former operators. We began the stabilization process in 1996 and
completed it in 1999. Upon completion, the relevant Texas authority indicated that it would issue a no-further-action letter and close its file regarding this facility. We paid all
remediation and related costs from the $3.0 million fund and, in accordance with the acquisition agreement, distributed the remainder of the fund to the seller of the Dallas facility, less
$200,000 which was held back to cover the costs of obtaining the no-further-action letter. We are not assured of receiving the no-further-action letter and we may incur further
liabilities if the stabilization process proves ineffective. In addition, in 1994, we detected a small quantity of two hazardous substances in a temporary groundwater monitoring well at the Dallas
facility. Our environmental consultants concluded that both substances arose from an off-site source and no further action was recommended.

In
1991, we detected metals and hydrocarbon soil contamination and metal contamination in the groundwater at one of our California facilities. We determined that the contamination was associated with
uses of the property by persons prior to the time that we became the occupant of the facility. We obtained specific indemnification from the landowner of such facility for any liability for
pre-existing environmental contamination.

In
1991, we removed an underground storage tank from one of our California facilities after monitoring devices indicated that the tank was leaking. Subsequent testing revealed localized low level
contamination of the soil and ground water where the tank was removed, but no migration of the contamination. We retained the services of an environmental consultant to represent us before the local
county environmental management department. The consultant informed us that the county agreed to a plan involving periodic monitoring of soil and ground water to ensure that the contamination is not
spreading. In 1997, the county issued a remedial action completion certification indicating that no further action related to the underground storage tank release is required.

In
1995, in connection with the acquisition of NER Auction Systems ("NER"), we engaged environmental consultants to perform a limited environmental assessment of the properties on which NER conducted
its business. The site assessment of the facility in Bellingham, Massachusetts which was leased by us, reported concentrations of benzene and MTBE in the groundwater that slightly exceeded reportable
concentrations under Massachusetts law. The owner of the property initiated remediation of this contamination and, to the best of our knowledge, that remediation plan has been completed. Additional
remediation costs may be necessary, however, if any groundwater beyond the site has been contaminated or the relevant Massachusetts authorities require additional work. Pursuant to the terms of the
NER acquisition, we are indemnified for any environmental liabilities by the former shareholders of NER relating to the former NER sites being leased by us, including the Bellingham site.

We
do not believe that any of the above environmental matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition or results of operations.

Governmental Regulations

Our operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations. The acquisition and sale of
damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by state motor vehicle departments. In addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of vehicles, we are also subject to various local zoning
requirements with regard to the location of our auction and storage facilities. These zoning requirements vary from location to location. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects
with applicable regulatory requirements. We may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal, state, and local governmental agencies in new markets.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the ordinary course of business. Currently, we are not a party to any
material legal proceedings.


FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

We depend on a limited number of major suppliers of salvage vehicles, and the loss of one or more of these major suppliers could adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition.

Historically,
a limited number of vehicle suppliers have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues. In fiscal year 2001, vehicles supplied by our two largest suppliers accounted for
approximately 13% and 9% of our revenues, respectively. Supplier arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice.
Vehicle suppliers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets which has affected the pricing for auction services. There can be no assurance that our existing agreements will
not be canceled. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle suppliers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage
vehicles. A reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle supplier or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a substantial vehicle supplier could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition.

The salvage vehicle auction industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully.

We
face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles. We believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction companies and vehicle dismantlers,
many of whom may have established relationships with vehicle suppliers and buyers and may have greater financial resources than us. Due to the limited number of vehicle suppliers and the absence of
long-term contractual commitments between us and our suppliers, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense.

We
may also encounter significant competition for local, regional and national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers. There can be no assurance that the existence of other local, regional or
national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans. Furthermore, we are likely to face competition from major competitors
in the acquisition of salvage vehicle auction facilities, which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations. These potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses, organized salvage vehicle buying groups, automobile
manufacturers, automobile auctioneers and software companies. While most vehicle suppliers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such
as us, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue, which could adversely affect our market share, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, existing or new competitors
may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us; therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.

Because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new salvage vehicle auction facilities, the rate of growth of our business and
revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and development of new facilities.

We
seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of other salvage vehicle auction facilities and the development of new salvage vehicle auction facilities. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to:

•

raise
additional capital, if required, on favorable terms;

•

continue
to acquire additional facilities on favorable terms; or

•

increase
revenues and profitability at newly acquired facilities.

Our
inability to acquire or open new auction facilities may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our acquisitions and facility openings in the future may
not allow us to sustain our historic rate of growth, which may also adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that our future growth and expansion,
if any, will result in increasing profitability.


As we continue to expand our operations, our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition.

Our
ability to manage growth is not only dependent on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities, but also on our ability to:

•

hire,
train and manage additional qualified personnel;

•

establish
new relationships or expand existing relationships with vehicle suppliers;

•

identify
and acquire or lease suitable premises on competitive terms;

•

secure
adequate capital;

•

maintain
the supply of vehicles from vehicle suppliers; and

•

compete
successfully in the public automobile auction sector.

Our
inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We have limited experience in the public automobile auction business and may not be successful in our efforts to compete in this market, which may adversely affect our current
growth strategy.

We
have historically focused on the operation, acquisition and development of salvage vehicle auction facilities and only have limited experience in operating public automobile auction facilities. The
public automobile auction market differs from the salvage vehicle auction market in that used vehicles in general working order are sold to the public. We intend to expand our public automobile
auction facilities through the acquisition of public auction sites and cannot know whether our existing salvage auction business model will translate successfully into the public automobile auction
market. To the
extent that we cannot successfully compete in the public automobile auction market, our growth strategy could be harmed.

Our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate, causing the price of our stock to decline.

Our
revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors, many of
which are beyond our control. Factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

fluctuations
in the market value of salvage and used vehicles;

•

the
availability of salvage vehicles;

•

variations
in vehicle accident rates;

•

buyer
attendance at salvage vehicle auctions;

•

delays
or changes in state title processing;

•

changes
in state or federal laws or regulations affecting salvage vehicles;

•

our
ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully;

•

the
timing and size of our new facility openings;

•

the
announcement of new vehicle supply agreements by us or our competitors;

•

severity
of weather and seasonality of weather patterns;

•

the
amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;
and

•

the
availability and cost of general business insurance.

Due
to the foregoing factors, our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our
results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance. In the event such fluctuations result in our financial


performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.

Government regulation of the salvage vehicle auction industry may impair our operations, increase our costs of doing business and create potential
liability.

Participants
in the salvage vehicle auction industry are subject to, and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with, a variety of federal, state and local governmental, regulatory and
administrative rules, regulations, licensure requirements and procedures, including those governing vehicle registration, the environment, zoning and land use. Failure to comply with present or future
regulations or changes in interpretations of existing regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities. In addition, new regulatory
requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities, may limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our vehicles.

The operation of salvage vehicle auction facilities poses certain environmental risks which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition.

Our
operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment. In the salvage vehicle auction industry, large numbers of wrecked vehicles are
stored at auction facilities and, during that time, spills of fuel, motor oils and other fluids may occur, resulting in soil, surface water or groundwater contamination. In addition, certain of our
facilities generate and/or store petroleum products and other hazardous materials, including waste solvents and used oils. We could incur substantial expenditures for preventative, investigative or
remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations, contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities, or the disposal of our waste at
off-site locations. Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant
costs in the future. Although we have obtained indemnification for pre-existing environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities, there
can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate. Any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

If we experience problems with our trucking fleet operations, our business could be harmed.

We
use a fleet of trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our auction facilities. We are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services, including inclement weather,
disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, availability and price of fuel and other liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance. In addition, our failure to
pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other shareholders.

Currently,
our executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 28% of our common stock. If they were to act together, these shareholders would have
significant influence over most matters requiring approval by shareholders, including the election of directors, any amendments to our articles of incorporation and certain significant corporate
transactions. In addition, without the consent of these shareholders, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors. These
shareholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors.

If we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our
objectives.

Our
future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team, all of whom are employed on an at-will basis and none of whom are subject to
any agreements not to compete. If we lose the service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, in particular Willis J. Johnson, our Chief Executive Officer, and A. Jayson Adair, our
President, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business
objectives.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We process salvage vehicles principally on a consignment method, on either the Percentage Incentive Program ("PIP") or on a fixed fee consignment basis. Using either
consignment method, only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue.

For
the fiscal years ended July 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, approximately 62%, 55% and 50% of the vehicles we sold, respectively, were processed under PIP. The increase in the percentage of
vehicles sold under PIP in fiscal 2001 is due to our successful marketing efforts. We attempt to convert acquired operations to PIP, which typically results in higher net returns to vehicle suppliers
and higher fees to us than standard fixed fee consignment programs.

For
the fiscal years ended July 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, approximately 38%, 44% and 49% of the vehicles we sold, respectively, were processed under fixed fee agreements. The decline in the
percentage of vehicles under fixed contracts is the direct result of our marketing efforts to convert contracts from fixed fee to PIP.


Additionally, for each of the fiscal years ended July 31, 2000 and 1999, approximately 1% of the vehicles sold by us were processed pursuant to purchase contracts, under which we record the
gross proceeds of the vehicle sale in purchased vehicle revenues and the cost of the vehicle in yard and fleet expenses.

Due
to a number of factors, including the timing and size of new acquisitions, market conditions, and acceptance of PIP by vehicle suppliers, the percentage of vehicles processed under these programs
in future periods may vary.

Our
revenues consist of salvage fees charged to vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers, transportation revenue and purchased vehicle revenues. Salvage fees from vehicle suppliers include fees under PIP
agreements and fixed programs where we charge for title processing, special preparation, storage and auctioning. Salvage fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles,
storage and annual registration. Transportation revenue includes charges to suppliers for towing vehicles under fixed fee contracts. Transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to
buyers for delivering vehicles. Purchased vehicle revenues are comprised of the price that buyers paid at our auctions for vehicles processed under the Purchase Program.

Costs
attributable to yard and fleet expenses consist primarily of operating personnel (which includes yard management, clerical and yard employees), rent, contract vehicle towing, insurance, fuel,
fleet maintenance and repair, and acquisition costs of salvage vehicles under the Purchase Program. Costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive, accounting
and data processing, sales personnel, professional fees and marketing expenses.

The
period-to-period comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions and new openings made by us during such
periods.

Acquisitions and New Operations

We have experienced significant growth as we have acquired fifteen salvage vehicle auction facilities and established ten new facilities since the beginning of fiscal 1999. All
of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired (consisting
principally of goodwill) is being amortized over periods not exceeding 40 years.

As
part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated service to vehicle suppliers, we anticipate further attempts to open or acquire facilities in new regions, as well as the regions
currently served by our facilities.* As part of this strategy, during fiscal 2001, we acquired salvage vehicle auction facilities in or near Chatham, Virginia; Shreveport, Louisiana and Mount Morris,
Pennsylvania and opened new facilities in or near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Chicago Heights, Illinois; Martinez, California; Lawrenceburg, Kentucky and New Orleans, Louisiana. In fiscal 2000, we
acquired facilities in or near Chesapeake, Virginia; Peoria, Illinois; North Boston, Massachusetts; Boise, Idaho; Pasco, Washington; Abilene, Texas; San Antonio, Texas and Albuquerque, New Mexico and
opened new facilities in Graham, Washington; Denver, Colorado and West Palm Beach, Florida. In fiscal 1999, we acquired facilities in or near McAllen, Texas; Huntsville, Alabama and Wichita, Kansas
and opened new facilities in Nashville, Tennessee and Austin, Texas. We believe that these acquisitions and openings help to expand our nationwide service and coverage of the United States.

We
seek to increase revenues and profitability by, among other things, (i) acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle auction facilities in key markets, (ii) pursuing national and
regional vehicle supply agreements, (iii) expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers, including data collection and management systems, (iv) developing and expanding public
automobile auction facilities, (v) implementing our buyer fee structure, and (vi) initiating our merchandising procedures. In addition, we attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of
our acquired facilities through, among other things, implementing our operational procedures, integrating our management information systems and, when necessary, redeploying personnel.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

Revenues were approximately $253.9 million during fiscal 2001, an increase of approximately $63.8 million, or 34%, over fiscal 2000. The increase in revenues was
due primarily to the increase in gross proceeds generated from auctioned
salvage vehicles. Gross proceeds were approximately $1,054.2 million during fiscal 2001, an increase of approximately $209.3 million, or 25%, over fiscal 2000.

New
facilities in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Chicago Heights, Illinois; Chatham, Virginia; Shreveport, Louisiana; Mount Morris, Pennsylvania; Martinez, California; Lawrenceburg, Kentucky and New
Orleans, Louisiana contributed $5.3 million of new revenue during fiscal 2001.

Yard
and fleet expenses were approximately $152.1 million during fiscal 2001, an increase of approximately $35.4 million, or 30%, over fiscal 2000. The increase in yard and fleet
expenses was due principally to the cost of handling increased volume at existing operations and the costs of new facilities. Approximately $5.8 million of the increase was the result of the
acquisition and opening of new facilities. Yard and fleet expenses from existing facilities grew by approximately $29.6 million, or 25%, compared to existing facility revenue growth of
approximately $58.5 million, or 31%. Yard and fleet expenses decreased to 60% of revenues during fiscal 2001, as compared to 61% of revenues during fiscal 2000.

General
and administrative expenses were approximately $19.4 million during fiscal 2001, an increase of approximately $3.7 million, or 24%, over fiscal 2000. This increase was due
primarily to increased payroll and other operating expenses. General and administrative expenses remained unchanged at 8% of revenues during fiscal 2001 and 2000.

Depreciation
and amortization expense was approximately $14.4 million during fiscal 2001, an increase of approximately $2.9 million, or 25%, over fiscal 2000. This increase was due
primarily to depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures, goodwill and covenants not to compete and depreciation of acquired assets resulting from the acquisition of new salvage auction
facilities.

Interest
expense was approximately $494,500 during fiscal 2001, a decrease of $55,300 over fiscal 2000.

Total
other income was approximately $1.9 million during fiscal 2001, an increase of approximately $1.3 million over 2000. This increase was due primarily to an insurance settlement,
additional interest income and additional rental income.

Our
effective combined federal, state and local income tax rate of 40% for fiscal 2001 was higher than our fiscal 2000 effective income tax rate of 39% due to our increase in income and the higher tax
rates in jurisdictions in which we acquired new facilities.


Due to the foregoing factors, we realized net income of approximately $42.7 million for fiscal 2001, compared to net income of approximately $29.4 million for fiscal 2000.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999

Revenues were approximately $190.0 million during fiscal 2000, an increase of approximately $48.3 million, or 34.1%, over fiscal 1999. The increase in revenues
was driven primarily by the increase in gross proceeds generated from auctioned salvage vehicles. Gross proceeds were approximately $844.9 million during fiscal 2000, an increase of
approximately $203.4 million, or 32%, over fiscal 1999.

New
facilities in Chesapeake, Virginia; Graham, Washington; Denver, Colorado; Peoria, Illinois; North Boston, Massachusetts; Boise, Idaho; Pasco, Washington; West Palm Beach, Florida; Abilene, Texas;
San Antonio, Texas and Albuquerque, New Mexico contributed $8.1 million of new revenue during fiscal 2000.

and fleet expenses were approximately $116.7 million during fiscal 2000, an increase of approximately $30.2 million, or 34.9%, over fiscal 1999. The increase in yard and fleet
expenses was due principally to the cost of handling increased volume at existing operations and the costs of new facilities. Approximately $7.9 million of the increase was the result of the
acquisition and opening of new facilities. Yard and fleet expenses from existing facilities grew by approximately $22.3 million, or 26%, compared to existing facility revenue growth of
approximately $40.2 million, or 28%. Yard and fleet expense remained unchanged at 61% of revenues during fiscal 2000.

General
and administrative expenses were approximately $15.6 million during fiscal 2000, an increase of approximately $3.6 million, or 29.8%, over fiscal 1999. This increase was due
primarily to increased payroll and other operating expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased to 8.2% of revenues during fiscal 2000, as compared to 8.5% of revenues during fiscal 1999.

Depreciation
and amortization expense was approximately $11.5 million during fiscal 2000, an increase of approximately $1.7 million, or 16.8%, over fiscal 1999. This increase was due
primarily to depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures, goodwill and covenants not to compete and depreciation of acquired assets resulting from the acquisition of new salvage auction
facilities.

Interest
expense was approximately $549,800 during fiscal 2000, a decrease of $34,200 over fiscal 1999.

Our
effective combined federal, state and local income tax rate of 39% for fiscal 2000 was higher than our fiscal 1999 effective income tax rate of 37% due to overaccruals relating to fiscal 1998 and
tax exempt interest income in fiscal 1999.

Due
to the foregoing factors, we realized net income of approximately $29.4 million for fiscal 2000, compared to net income of approximately $22.0 million for fiscal 1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have financed our growth through cash generated from operations, debt financing, public offerings of common stock, and the equity issued in conjunction with certain
acquisitions.

As
of July 31, 2001, we had working capital of approximately $69.4 million, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately $15.2 million and we are able to process, market,
sell and receive payment for processed vehicles quickly. Our primary source of cash is from the collection of sellers' fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of auctioned salvage vehicles
and from buyers' fees.

On
February 23, 2001, we entered into a new credit facility with our existing banking syndicate. The new facility provided by Wells Fargo Bank, Fleet National Bank and U.S. Bank National
Association consists of an unsecured revolving reducing line of credit in the amount of $100 million that matures in 2006. The new facility replaced our $30 million credit facility with
the same bank group. As of July 31, 2001, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility. We are subject to customary covenants, including restrictions on the payments of dividends,
with which we are in compliance.

We
have agreements with certain financial institutions whereby the institutions will purchase approximately $11.0 million of yard and fleet equipment as of July 31, 2001, which will be
leased back to us under operating leases.

Net
cash provided by operating activities increased by $30.7 million from fiscal 2000 to $56.9 million in fiscal 2001, reflecting our increased profitability and the timing of certain
income tax payments during the fiscal year.


During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2001, we used cash for the acquisition of operations in Chatham, Virginia; Shreveport, Louisiana and Mount Morris, Pennsylvania, which had an aggregate
cash cost of approximately $5.1 million. In addition, we issued approximately $0.9 million in value of our common stock in conjunction with the fiscal 2001 acquisitions. During the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2000, we used cash for the acquisition of operations in Chesapeake, Virginia; Peoria, Illinois; North Boston, Massachusetts; Boise, Idaho; Pasco, Washington; Abilene,
Texas; San Antonio, Texas and Albuquerque, New Mexico, which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately $20.4 million. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 1999, we used cash for the
acquisition of operations in McAllen, Texas; Huntsville, Alabama and Wichita, Kansas, which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately $3.0 million.

Capital
expenditures (excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions) were approximately $45.9 million, $34.8 million and $20.2 million for fiscal 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Our capital expenditures have related primarily to opening and improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment. We have entered into agreements to acquire approximately
$0.9 million of additional multi-vehicle transport trucks and forklifts and to dispose of certain older equipment.

In
fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, we generated approximately $2.3 million, $2.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, through the exercise of stock options and warrants. During
fiscal 1999, we sold approximately $13.1 million of short-term investments.

Cash
and cash equivalents increased by approximately $3.1 million in fiscal 2001 and decreased by approximately $24.9 million in fiscal 2000. Our liquidity and capital resources have not
been materially affected by inflation. During the winter months, most of our facilities process 10% to 30% more vehicles than at other times of the year. This increased seasonal volume requires the
increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business.

We
believe that our currently available cash, cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities and equipment leasing lines will be sufficient to satisfy our
operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.* However, significant growth in the future may require the use of new debt or equity to raise additional cash.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141,

Business Combinations

, and Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. Statement 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001, as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. Statement 141 also specifies certain criteria that intangible assets acquired in
a purchase method business combination must meet in order to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill, noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for
separately. Statement 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of Statement 142
and can no longer be amortized. Statement 142 will also require that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives up to their estimated
residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with FAS Statement No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of

. In connection with the adoption of FAS 142, we will be required to perform a transitional goodwill impairment
assessment. Statement 142 must be adopted in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001; however, early adoption is permitted for companies before the issuance of first fiscal quarter
financial statements. We have not yet determined the exact impact these standards will have on our results of operations and financial position.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Copart, Inc.:

We
have audited the consolidated financial statements of Copart, Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in Item 14(a). In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the financial statement schedule as listed in Item 14(a). These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Copart, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 31,
2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended July 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

COPART, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

July 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues are generally recorded at the date the vehicles are sold at auction.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Vehicle Pooling Costs

Vehicle pooling costs consist of labor, towing, outside services and other costs directly attributable to the gathering and processing of vehicles prior to their sale. Vehicle
pooling costs are recognized as expenses in the period the vehicle is sold at auction. The Company continually evaluates and adjusts the components of vehicle pooling costs as necessary.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of the lease terms or the useful lives of the respective assets.

Depreciation
is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of: 3 to 7 years for transportation and other equipment; 5 to 10 years for office furniture
and equipment; and 15 to 19 years or life of lease, whichever is shorter, for buildings and leasehold improvements.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist primarily of covenants not to compete, goodwill and options to purchase leased property. Amortization, except for the options to purchase leased
property, is provided on the straight-line basis over the estimated lives, which range from five to forty years.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The amounts recorded for financial instruments in the Company's consolidated financial statements approximate fair value.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share amounts were computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share amounts were
computed by dividing net income by the


weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus dilutive potential common shares calculated for stock options and warrants outstanding using the treasury stock method.

Accounting for Stock Options

The Company accounts for its stock option plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees," and related interpretations. As such, compensation expense is recorded only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price on the date of grant. The Company
has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which allows entities to continue to apply provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and
provide pro forma net
income and pro forma net income per share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in fiscal 1996 and future years as if the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123
had been applied.

Comprehensive Income

The Company has no items of other comprehensive income in any period presented. Therefore, net income as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income equals comprehensive
income.

Segment Reporting

All of the Company's facilities are aggregated into one reportable segment given the similarities of economic characteristics between the operations represented by the
facilities and the common nature of the products, customers and methods of revenue generation.

Use of Estimates

Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If
such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property and equipment exceeds its fair market value. In
addition, the Company continually evaluates the recoverability of enterprise goodwill by assessing whether the book value can be recovered through expected and undiscounted cash flows.

(2) Acquisitions

Fiscal 2001 Transactions

During fiscal 2001 the Company made the following acquisitions: Auto Salvage Disposal, Inc., of Chatham, Virginia; Twin City Salvage Pool, Inc., of Shreveport,
Louisiana and Mountain State Auto Auction, Inc., of Mount Morris, Pennsylvania. The consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of $5,099,000 in cash and 43,749 shares of common stock
valued at approximately $862,700. The acquired net assets consisted of accounts and advances receivable, inventory, fixed assets, goodwill, and covenants not to compete. The acquisitions were
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates are included in the Company's consolidated statements of income. These new
facilities contributed $1.9 million of revenues during fiscal 2001. The excess of the purchase price over fair market value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $3,505,700 has been
recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. In addition, the Company paid $150,000 for covenants not to compete


relating to these acquisitions, which are being amortized over the life of these agreements. In conjunction with the Chatham, Virginia; Shreveport, Louisiana and Mount Morris, Pennsylvania
acquisitions, the Company entered into leases for the use of these facilities.

$20,426,000 in cash. The acquired net assets consisted of accounts and advances receivable, inventory, fixed assets, goodwill, and covenants not to compete. The acquisitions were accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting, and the operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates are included in the Company's consolidated statements of income. These new facilities contributed
$6.4 million of revenues during fiscal 2000. The excess of the purchase price over fair market value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $11,751,900 has been recorded as goodwill and is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. In addition, the Company paid $4,466,000 for covenants not to compete relating to these acquisitions, which are being
amortized over the life of these
agreements. In conjunction with the Chesapeake, Virginia; Peoria, Illinois; North Boston, Massachusetts; Boise, Idaho; Pasco, Washington and Albuquerque, New Mexico acquisitions, the Company entered
into leases for the use of these facilities.

Fiscal 1999 Transactions

Pool, Inc., of Wichita, Kansas. The consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of $3,043,900 in cash. The acquired net assets consisted of accounts and advances receivable, inventory,
fixed assets, goodwill and covenants not to compete. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates are
included in the Company's consolidated statements of income. These new facilities contributed $0.1 million of revenues during fiscal 1999. The excess of the purchase price over fair market
value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $2,234,300 has been recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. In addition, the Company
paid $260,000 for covenants not to compete relating to these acquisitions, which are being amortized over the life of these agreements. In conjunction with each of these acquisitions, the Company

On February 23, 2001, the Company executed a new credit facility with its banking syndicate. The new facility provided by Wells Fargo Bank, Fleet National Bank and U.S. Bank
National Association consists of an unsecured revolving reducing line of credit in the amount of $100 million that matures in 2006. The new facility replaces the Company's $30 million
facility
with the same banking group. As of July 31, 2001, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility. The Company is subject to customary covenants, including restrictions on the payment
of dividends, with which it is in compliance.

(8) Shareholders' Equity

In each of fiscal 2000 and 1999, the Company declared a two-for-one forward common stock split. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have
been restated to reflect these two stock splits.

The
Company adopted the Copart, Inc. 1992 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") as amended, presently covering an aggregate of 8,000,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock. The Plan provides for the
grant of incentive stock options to employees and non-qualified stock options to employees, officers, directors and consultants at prices not less than 100% and 85% of the fair market
value for incentive and non-qualified stock options, respectively, as determined by the Board of Directors at the grant date. Incentive and non-qualified stock options may have
terms of up to ten years and vest over periods determined by the Board of Directors. Options generally vest ratably over a two or five year period.

In
March 1994, the Company adopted the Copart, Inc. 1994 Director Option Plan under which an aggregate of 160,000 shares of the Company's common stock are presently reserved. In general,
new non-employee directors will automatically receive grants of non-qualified stock options to purchase 12,000 shares and subsequent grants to purchase 6,000 additional shares
upon election and each subsequent re-election to the Company's board of directors, respectively.

The
Company has authorized the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value, none of which are issued or outstanding at July 31, 2001.


The Copart, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") provides for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company by employees pursuant to the terms
of the ESPP. The number of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the ESPP during each of fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 was 94,221, 73,526 and 86,590, respectively.

Pro
forma information regarding net income and net income per share is required by SFAS No. 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for options granted under its plans
using the fair value method. For these purposes, the fair value of options issued under the Plans was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions: no dividend yield, volatility factor of the expected market price of the Company's stock of 0.60, a forfeiture rate of 0.06, a weighted-average expected life of the options of five years
and a risk-free interest rate of 5.8%, 6.0% and 5.0% for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The weighted average fair value of options granted were $12.16, $8.62 and $3.56, for 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period. The effects of applying SFAS
No. 123 in this pro forma disclosure are not indicative of future results. The Company's pro forma net income and net income per common share would approximate the following:
