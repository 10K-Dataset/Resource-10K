PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Copart, Inc. is a leading provider of salvage
vehicle auction services in the United States.

We provide vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance
companies, with a full range of services to process and sell
salvage vehicles through auctions, principally to licensed
vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle
dealers and exporters. Salvage vehicles are either damaged
vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes
or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance
settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made. We
offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite
each stage of the salvage vehicle auction process and minimize
administrative and processing costs. We generate revenues
primarily from auction fees paid by vehicle suppliers and
vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as
towing and storage.

We have grown our salvage business through a
combination of acquisitions and the development of new
facilities and also by increasing our buyer base and
implementing additional value-added services for both buyers and
suppliers. For fiscal year 2004, our revenues were approximately
$400.8 million and our operating income was approximately
$124.8 million. During the fiscal year ending July 31,
2004, we acquired three salvage vehicle auction facilities and
opened two new salvage vehicle auction facilities. We acquired
auction sites located in Eugene, Oregon; Cleveland, Ohio and
Anchorage, Alaska. We opened new vehicle auction sites in
Toronto, Canada and Helena, Montana.

During fiscal 2004, we converted all of our
salvage vehicle auction facilities to an Internet based
auction-style model using our Virtual Bidding Second Generation
(“VB


”) Internet sales technology. This
second generation technology combines two bidding processes. An
open Preliminary Bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids
either at a bidding station at the auction facility during the
three preview days or over the Internet. To improve the
effectiveness of bidding, the VB


system lets a buyer
see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase.
The preliminary bidding phase is an open sales format. Buyers
enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle
and BID4U will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf.
Preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an
Internet-only virtual sale. BID4U will represent the high
preliminary bidder at the Internet-only virtual sale. This
feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other
and the high preliminary bidder. The bidders enter bids via the
Internet in a real time format. BID4U submits bids for the high
preliminary bidder, up to their maximum bid. When bidding stops,
a countdown is initiated. If no bids are received during the
countdown, the vehicle sells to the highest bidder.
VB


opens our sales process to registered buyers
anywhere in the world who have Internet access.

We believe the implementation of VB


across our salvage operations has increased the pool of
available buyers for each sale and the added competition has
increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for salvage from
us. It has also improved the efficiency of our operations. For
fiscal 2004, sales of vehicles to buyers outside the state where
the vehicle is located accounted for 41% of total vehicles sold;
24% of salvage vehicles were sold to out of state buyers and 17%
were sold to buyers out of country.



We believe that we offer the highest level of
service in the salvage vehicle auction industry and have
established our leading market position as follows:

We have expanded our business beyond salvage
vehicle auction services and have entered the market for public
auctioning of used vehicles. We auction vehicles directly to the
public and automobile dealers on behalf of banks, leasing or
financing companies, automobile dealers, repossession companies
and for our own account. To date, we own six public automobile
auction facilities located in Detroit, Michigan; Chesapeake,
Virginia; New Castle, Delaware; Greencastle, Pennsylvania;
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Richmond, Virginia. We operate our
public automobile auction business under Motors Auction Group,
Inc. (“MAG”), a wholly owned subsidiary. To date,
revenues from our public auction business have not been
significant relative to the revenues from our salvage business.

We were organized as a California corporation in
1982 and became a public company in 1994. Our principal
executive offices are located at 4665 Business Center Drive,
Fairfield, California 94534, and our telephone number at that
address is (707) 639-5000. We maintain a website,

http://www.copart.com

, where we make available, free of
charge, our Securities and Exchange Commission filings,
including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and
all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as
reasonably practicable after we electronically file such
material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange
Commission. We are providing the address to our website solely
for information of investors. Information contained on our
website is not incorporated by reference herein and our web
address is included as an inactive textual reference only.

Industry Overview

The salvage vehicle auction industry provides an
outlet for salvage vehicle suppliers to liquidate total loss
vehicles. Salvage vehicle auction companies generally auction
salvage vehicles on consignment either for a fixed fee or a
percentage of the sales price. On occasion, salvage auction
companies may purchase vehicles from vehicle suppliers at a
formula-based price, based on a percentage of the vehicles’
estimated pre-loss value (“actual cash value”) and
auction the vehicles for their own account. Salvage vehicle
auction companies typically operate from one or more salvage
facilities where vehicles are processed, stored and sold.



Although there are other suppliers of salvage
vehicles, such as financial institutions, vehicle leasing
companies, automobile rental companies, charities and automobile
dealers, the primary source of salvage vehicles is insurance
companies.

Automobile manufacturers are incorporating
certain standard features that increase passenger safety,
including unibody construction, passenger safety cages with
surrounding crumple zones to absorb impacts, plastic components,
airbags, xenon lights and computer systems. We believe that one
effect of these features is that newer vehicles involved in
accidents are more likely to be deemed a total loss for
insurance purposes, resulting in an increasing supply of total
loss salvage vehicles in the future.

The primary buyers of salvage vehicles are
vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle
dealers and exporters. Vehicle dismantlers, which we believe are
the largest group of salvage vehicle buyers, either dismantle a
vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle
to rebuilders, used vehicle dealers or the public. Vehicle
rebuilders and vehicle repair licensees generally purchase
salvage vehicles to repair and resell. Used vehicle dealers
generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged vehicles
for resale.

Following an accident involving an insured
vehicle, the damaged vehicle is generally towed to a towing
company or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage
pending insurance company examination. The vehicle is inspected
by the insurance company’s adjuster, who estimates the
costs of repairing the vehicle and gathers information regarding
the damaged vehicle’s mileage, options and condition in
order to estimate its actual cash value. The adjuster determines
whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a total
loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs and
the vehicle’s salvage value, as well as customer service
considerations. If the cost of repair is greater than the actual
cash value less the estimated salvage value, the insurance
company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss. The
insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a
salvage vehicle auction company, settle with the insured vehicle
owner and receive title to the vehicle.

The primary factors that vehicle suppliers
consider when selecting a salvage vehicle auction company
include:

Upon receipt of the pick up order, the salvage
vehicle auction company arranges for the transport of a vehicle
to a facility. As a service to the vehicle supplier, the salvage
vehicle auction company will customarily pay advance charges
(reimbursable charges paid on behalf of vehicle suppliers) to
obtain the subject vehicle’s release from a towing company
or vehicle repair facility. Typically, advance charges paid on
behalf of the vehicle supplier are recovered upon sale of the
salvage vehicle.

The vehicle then remains in storage until
ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle
owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the
appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency
(“DMV”). Total loss



vehicles may be sold in most states only after
obtaining a salvage title from the DMV. Upon receipt of the
appropriate documentation from the DMV, which is generally
received within 45 to 60 days of vehicle pick-up, the
vehicle is sold.

Operating and Growth Strategy

Our growth strategy is to increase our revenues
and profitability by, among other things (i) acquiring and
developing new salvage vehicle auction facilities in key
markets, (ii) pursuing national and regional vehicle supply
agreements, (iii) expanding our service offerings to
suppliers and buyers, (iv) increasing revenue and
profitability at our public automobile auction facilities and
(v) expanding the application of VB


into new
markets. In addition, we implement our pricing structure and
merchandising procedures and attempt to affect cost efficiencies
at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our
operational procedures, integrating our management information
systems and redeploying personnel when necessary.

As part of our overall expansion strategy, our
objective is to increase our revenues, operating profits and
market share in the vehicle auction industry. To implement our
growth strategy, we intend to continue to do the following:

Acquire and Develop New Salvage Vehicle
    Auction Facilities in Key Markets

Our strategy is to offer integrated services to
vehicle suppliers on a national or regional basis by acquiring
or developing salvage facilities in new and existing markets. We
integrate our new acquisitions into our national network and
capitalize on certain operating efficiencies resulting from,
among other things, the reduction of duplicative overhead and
the implementation of our operating procedures.

The following chart sets forth facilities that we
have acquired or opened since the beginning of fiscal year 2002
through July 31, 2004.



Pursue National and Regional Vehicle Supply
    Agreements

Our broad national presence enhances our ability
to enter into local, regional or national supply agreements with
vehicle suppliers. We actively seek to establish national and
regional supply agreements with insurance companies by promoting
our ability to achieve high net returns and broader access to
buyers through our national coverage and electronic commerce
capabilities. By utilizing our existing insurance company
supplier relationships, we are able to build new supplier
relationships and pursue additional supply agreements in
existing and new markets.

Expand Our Service Offerings to Suppliers
    and Buyers

Over the past several years, we have expanded our
available service offerings to vehicle suppliers and buyers. The
primary focus of these new service offerings is to maximize
returns to our suppliers and maximize product value to our
buyers. Recent service enhancements include, for our suppliers,
real-time access to sales data over the Internet and, for our
buyers, the implementation of VB


real-time bidding
at all of our facilities, permitting buyers at any location
world wide to participate in the auction at all of our yards in
North America. We plan to continue to refine and expand our
services, including offering software that can assist our
suppliers in expediting claims and salvage management tools that
help suppliers integrate their systems with ours.

Increase Revenue and Profitability at Our
    Public Auction Facilities

Our public automobile auctions allow dealers to
bid via the Internet and both dealers and the general public to
bid at live auctions on a wide range of end-of-lease vehicles,
repossessed vehicles, dealer trade-ins and vehicles that we
offer for sale on our own account. To date, we have acquired six
facilities and launched our public automobile auction website.
We believe that through the introduction of VB


and
increased vehicle volumes we will increase revenue and
profitability at our public auction facilities.

Expand the Application of VB


into New Markets

We believe that the value that VB


has
demonstrated in the salvage vehicle auction market, primarily
by; (i) increasing returns to sellers by expanding the pool
of bidders to any person in the world with access to the
Internet and (ii) increasing buyer convenience by
eliminating the need to travel to the physical location of the
auction, can be beneficial to other industries. Accordingly, we
will actively explore the possible application of VB


outside of the salvage vehicle auction industry.

Our Competitive Advantages

We believe that the following attributes and the
services that we offer position us to take advantage of many
opportunities in the salvage vehicle auction industry.



National Coverage and Ability to Respond on
    a National Scale

Since our inception in 1982, we have expanded
from a single facility in Vallejo, California to an integrated
network of 107 facilities located in the United States and
Canada as of July 31, 2004. We are able to offer integrated
services on a national basis to our vehicle suppliers, which
allow us to respond to the needs of our suppliers and buyers
with maximum efficiency. Our national coverage provides our
suppliers with key advantages, including:

Value-Added Services

We believe that we offer the most comprehensive
range of services in our industry, including:

Proven Ability to Acquire and Integrate
    Acquisitions

We have a proven track record of successfully
acquiring and integrating salvage vehicle auction facilities.
Since becoming a public company in 1994, we have completed the
acquisition of 58 salvage vehicle auction facilities. As part of
our acquisition and integration strategy, we seek to:

•

strengthen our national network and access new
    markets;

•

utilize our existing corporate and technology
    infrastructure over a larger base of operations; and

•

introduce our comprehensive services and
    operational expertise.

We strive to integrate all new facilities into
our existing network without disruption of service to vehicle
suppliers. We work with new suppliers to implement our fee
structures and new service programs. We typically retain
existing employees at acquired facilities in order to gain
knowledge about, and respond to, the local market. We also
assign a special integration team to help convert newly acquired
facilities to our own management information and proprietary



software systems, enabling us to ensure a smooth
and consistent transition to our business operating and auction
systems.

Technology to Enhance and Expand Our
    Business

We have developed management information and
proprietary software systems that allow us to deliver a fully
integrated service offering. Our proprietary software programs
provide vehicle suppliers with online access to data and reports
regarding their salvage vehicles being processed at any of our
facilities. This technology allows vehicle suppliers to monitor
each stage of our salvage vehicle auction process, from pick up
to sale and settlement by the buyer. Our full range of Internet
services allows us to expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle
auction process and minimizes the administrative and processing
costs for us as well as our suppliers. We believe that our
integrated technology systems generate improved capacity and
financial returns for our clients, resulting in high client
retention, and allow us to expand our national supply contracts.

Our Service Offerings

We offer vehicle suppliers a full range of
services, which expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle
auction process, maximizing proceeds and minimizing costs.

Online Supplier Access

Through Copart Access, our Internet-based service
for vehicle suppliers, we enable suppliers to assign vehicles
for sale, check sales calendars, view vehicle images and
history, view and reprint body shop invoices and towing receipts
and view the historical performance of the vehicles sold at our
auctions.

Salvage Estimation Services

We offer Copart ProQuote, a proprietary service
that assists suppliers in the vehicle claims evaluation process
by providing online salvage value estimates, which helps
suppliers determine whether to repair a particular vehicle or
deem it a total loss.

Transportation
Services

We maintain contracts with third-party vehicle
transport companies, which enables us to pick up most of our
suppliers’ vehicles within 24 hours. Our national
network and transportation capabilities provide cost and time
savings to our vehicle suppliers and ensures on-time vehicle
pick up and prompt response to catastrophes and natural
disasters.

Vehicle Inspection
Stations

We offer certain of our major insurance company
suppliers office and yard space to house vehicle inspection
stations on-site at our auction facilities. We have over 30
vehicle inspection stations at our facilities nationwide. An
on-site vehicle inspection station provides our insurance
company suppliers with a central location to inspect potential
total loss vehicles, which reduces storage charges that
otherwise may be incurred at the initial storage or repair
facility.



On-Demand
Reporting

We provide vehicle suppliers with on-demand
reports online, via fax or e-mail that summarize data on salvage
vehicles that we process for the particular supplier. These
reports track our vehicle suppliers’ gross and net returns
on each vehicle, service charges, and other data that enable our
vehicle suppliers to more easily administer and monitor the
salvage vehicle disposition process.

DMV
Processing

We have extensive expertise in DMV document and
title processing for salvage vehicles. We have developed a
computer system which provides a direct link to the DMV computer
systems of several states. This allows us to expedite the
processing of vehicle title paperwork.

Flexible Vehicle
Processing Programs

At the election of the vehicle supplier, we
auction vehicles pursuant to our Percentage Incentive Program
consignment basis or on a fixed fee consignment basis.

Percentage Fee
Consignment.

Our Percentage Incentive
Program (“PIP”) is an innovative processing program
designed to broadly serve the needs of vehicle suppliers. Under
PIP, we agree to sell at auction all of the salvage vehicles of
a vehicle supplier in a specified market for a predetermined
percentage of the vehicle sales price. Because our revenues
under PIP are directly linked to the vehicle’s sale price,
we have an incentive to actively merchandise those vehicles to
maximize the net return on salvage vehicles. We provide the
vehicle supplier, at our expense, with transport of the vehicle
to our nearest facility, storage for up to 90 days and DMV
document and title processing. In addition, we provide
merchandising services such as covering or taping openings to
protect vehicle interiors from weather, washing vehicle
exteriors, vacuuming vehicle interiors, cleaning and polishing
dashboards and tires, making keys for driveable vehicles and
identifying driveable vehicles. We believe our merchandising
efforts increase the sales prices of salvage vehicles, thereby
increasing the return on salvage vehicles to both vehicle
suppliers and us. In fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002 we
processed approximately 65%, 67% and 67%, respectively, of all
our salvage vehicles under PIP.

Fixed Fee
Consignment.

Under our fixed fee
consignment program, we sell vehicles for a fixed consignment
fee, generally $50 to $175 per vehicle. Although sometimes
included in the consignment fee, we may also charge additional
fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility,
storage of the vehicle, and other incidental costs. In fiscal
year 2004, 2003 and 2002 we processed approximately 35%, 33% and
33%, respectively, of all our salvage vehicles under the fixed
fee consignment program.

Buyer
Network

We maintain a database of thousands of registered
buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling,
rebuilding, repair, resale and exporting businesses. Our
database includes each buyer’s vehicle preference and
purchasing history. This data enables us to notify via e-mail
prospective buyers throughout the world of salvage vehicles
available for bidding that match their vehicle preferences.
Listings of salvage vehicles to be auctioned on a particular day
and location are also made available on the Internet.



Auction
Process

We offer a flexible and unique auction process
designed to maximize the sale prices of the vehicles that we
auction. We utilize VB


, a new auction methodology
that we developed. This second generation technology combines
two bidding processes. An open Preliminary Bidding feature
allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the
auction facility during the three preview days or over the
Internet. To improve the effectiveness of bidding, the
VB


system lets a buyer see the current high bid on
the vehicle they want to purchase. The preliminary bidding phase
is an open sales format. Buyers enter the maximum price they are
willing to pay for a vehicle and BID4U will incrementally bid
the vehicle on their behalf. Preliminary bidding ends one hour
prior to the start of an Internet-only virtual sale. BID4U will
represent the high preliminary bidder at the Internet-only
virtual sale. This feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid
against each other and the high preliminary bidder. The bidders
enter bids via the Internet in a real time format. BID4U submits
bids for the high preliminary bidder, up to their maximum bid.
When bidding stops, a countdown is initiated. If no bids are
received during the countdown, the vehicle sells to the highest
bidder. VB


opens our sales process to registered
buyers anywhere in the world who have Internet access.

CoPartfinder

CoPartfinder is our unique Internet “search
engine” that enables users to locate used vehicle parts
quickly and efficiently. CoPartfinder is accessible by the
public through a Copart-sponsored website. CoPartfinder lists
vehicles recently sold at our auctions and identifies certain
purchasers. This allows vehicle dismantlers and other resellers
to streamline their parts sale process and access a large pool
of potential buyers. We charge a nominal fee to potential parts
buyers, who can use CoPartfinder to search for specific vehicle
makes and models and view digital images of vehicles that meet
their requirements. Once a specific parts supplier is identified
for a specific part requirement, buyers may have the option to
call, fax, or e-mail the dismantler/supplier. We believe that
CoPartfinder provides an incentive for vehicle dismantlers to
purchase their salvage vehicles through our sales process.

Supply Arrangements and Supplier
Marketing

We obtain salvage vehicles from hundreds of
different vehicle suppliers. State Farm Insurance Company
accounted for 12%, 13% and 14% of our revenues for fiscal years
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Of the total number of
vehicles that we processed in fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002,
we obtained approximately 85%, 85% and 88%, respectively from
insurance company suppliers. Our arrangements with our suppliers
are either written or oral agreements that are typically subject
to cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice.

We typically contract with the regional or branch
office of an insurance company or other vehicle suppliers. The
agreements are customized to each vehicle supplier’s
particular needs and often provide for the disposition of
different types of salvage vehicles by differing methods. Our
contracts or arrangements generally provide that we will sell
total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the
vehicle supplier in a designated geographic area.

We market our services to vehicle suppliers
through an in-house sales force that utilizes a variety of sales
techniques, including targeted mailing of our sales literature,
telemarketing, follow-up personal sales calls, and participation
in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions.
Based upon our historical data on salvage vehicles and vehicle
information supplied by vehicle suppliers, our marketing
personnel will provide vehicle suppliers with detailed analysis
of the net return on salvage vehicles and a proposal setting
forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns
on salvage vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses.



Buyers

We maintain a database of thousands of registered
buyers of salvage vehicles in the vehicle dismantling,
rebuilding, repair, resale and export businesses. We believe
that we have established a broad international and domestic
buyer base by providing buyers of salvage vehicles with a
variety of programs and services. To gain admission to one of
our sales and become a registered buyer, prospective buyers must
first pay an initial registration fee and an annual fee, provide
requested personal and business information and have, in most
states, a vehicle dismantler’s, dealer’s, resale,
repair license or export license. Registration entitles a buyer
to transact business at any of our sales subject to local
licensing and permitting requirements. A buyer may also bring
guests to a facility to preview vehicles for sale for a fee.
Strict admission procedures are intended to prevent frivolous
bids that would invalidate the sale. We market to buyers on the
Internet and via e-mail notifications, sales notices,
telemarketing and participation in trade show events.

Competition

We face significant competition for the supply of
salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles. We
believe our principal competitors include vehicle auction
companies and vehicle dismantlers. These national, regional and
local competitors may have established relationships with
vehicle suppliers and buyers and may have financial resources
that are greater than ours. The largest national or regional
vehicle auctioneers include the ADESA Corporation, Auction
Broadcasting Company, Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc., Manheim
Auctions and SADISCO. The largest national dismantlers include
Greenleaf and LKQ Corporation. These national dismantlers, in
addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the American
Recycling Association and the United Recyclers Group, purchase
salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies, thereby
bypassing auction companies entirely, including us.

Management Information Systems

Our primary management information system
consists of an IBM AS/400 mainframe computer system, integrated
computer interfaces and proprietary business operating software
that we developed and which tracks salvage and public auction
vehicles throughout the auction process. We call this
proprietary business operating software the Copart Auction
System (“CAS”) and have implemented CAS at all of our
salvage auction facilities. For the public auction business we
call this proprietary business operating software Motors Auction
Exchange (“MAX”). In addition, we have integrated our
mainframe computer system with Internet and Intranet systems in
order to provide secure access to CAS and MAX data and images in
a variety of formats.

Our auction-style service product,
VB


, is served by an array of identical high-density,
high-performance Sun Fire servers. Each individual sale is
configured to run on an available server in the array and can be
rapidly provisioned to any other available server in the array
as required.

We have a complete back-up data center that is
designed to run the business in the event of an emergency. This
back-up data center is designed to be quickly deployed when
needed. We also host our own Intranet and Internet platforms.

Employees

As of July 31, 2004, we had approximately
2,235 full-time employees, of whom approximately 262 where
engaged in general and administrative functions and
approximately 1,973 were engaged in yard and fleet operations.



We are not currently subject to any collective
bargaining agreements. However, during the fiscal year, drivers,
clerical employees, and yard employees at our Woodhaven,
Michigan facility were represented by the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters (Teamsters) as a result of three NLRB
elections in January and July of 2003.

In October 2003, we made a strategic decision to
exit the trucking business and to retain independent subhaulers
instead. In late 2003, we terminated the employment of all our
truck drivers (other than truck drivers employed in Woodhaven,
Michigan), and commenced the sale of our truck fleet. Since our
Woodhaven, Michigan facility drivers were represented by the
Teamsters, we were required to bargain over the effects of that
decision on the Woodhaven drivers even though no collective
bargaining contract was in effect. In July 2004, we negotiated
an agreement with the Teamsters whereby we terminated the
employment of our Woodhaven facility drivers and the Teamsters
signed a settlement agreement waiving any claims concerning
their termination.

In September 2004, we negotiated an agreement
with the Teamsters whereby the Teamsters agreed to file a
Disclaimer of Interest with the NLRB concerning the Woodhaven,
Michigan clerical and yard employees. These units are therefore
no longer represented by a union, and we have no further
obligation to bargain with the Teamsters for any of our
Woodhaven, Michigan employees.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various laws and
regulations regarding the protection of the environment. In the
salvage vehicle auction industry, large numbers of wrecked
vehicles are stored at auction facilities and, during that time,
spills of fuel, motor oils and other fluids may occur, resulting
in soil, surface water or groundwater contamination. Certain of
our facilities store petroleum products and other hazardous
materials in above-ground containment tanks and some of our
facilities generate waste materials such as solvents or used
oils that must be disposed of as non-hazardous or hazardous
waste, as appropriate. We have implemented procedures to reduce
the amount of soil contamination that may occur at our
facilities, and we have initiated safety programs and training
of personnel on the safe storage and handling of hazardous
materials. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material
respects, with all applicable environmental regulations and we
do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to remain in
environmental compliance.

In connection with the acquisition of our Dallas,
Texas facility in 1994, we set aside $3.0 million to cover
the costs of environmental remediation, stabilization and
related consulting expenses for a six-acre portion of the
facility that contained elevated levels of lead due to the
activities of the former operators. We began the stabilization
process in 1996 and completed it in 1999. We paid all
remediation and related costs from the $3.0 million fund
and, in accordance with the acquisition agreement, distributed
the remainder of the fund to the seller of the Dallas facility,
less $200,000 which was held back to cover the costs of
obtaining the no-further-action letter. In September 2002, our
environmental engineering consultant issued a report, which
concludes that the soil stabilization has effectively stabilized
the lead-impacted soil, and that the concrete cap should prevent
impact to storm water and subsequent surface water impact. Our
consultant thereafter submitted an Operations and Maintenance
Plan (“Plan”) to the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality (“TCEQ”) providing for a two-year inspection
and maintenance plan for the concrete cap, and a two-year ground
and surface water monitoring plan. In January of 2003, the TCEQ
approved the Plan, subject to the additions of upstream
(background) surface water samples from the intermittent
stream adjacent to the facility and documentation of any repairs
to the concrete cap during the post closure-monitoring period.
The first semi-annual water sampling was conducted in April
2003, which reflected that the lead-impacted, stabilized soil is
not



impacting the ground and/or surface water. The
second round of semi-annual water samples collected in October
and November 2003 reported concentration of lead in one storm
water and one surface water sample in excess of the established
upstream criteria for lead. In correspondence, which we received
in July 2004, the TCEQ approved with comment our water
monitoring report dated February 24, 2004. The TCEQ
instructed us to continue with post-closure monitoring and
maintenance activities and submit the next report in accordance
with the approved schedules. If the tests conducted for the
remainder of the two-year monitoring period provided for in the
Plan demonstrate that the lead-impacted, stabilized soil is not
materially impacting the ground and/or surface water, a
no-further-action letter will be requested at that time. We are
not assured of receiving the no-further-action letter and we may
incur further liabilities if the stabilization process proves
ineffective. In addition, in 1994, we detected a small quantity
of two hazardous substances in a temporary groundwater
monitoring well at the Dallas facility. Our environmental
consultants concluded that both substances arose from an
off-site source and no further action was recommended.

We do not believe that any of the above
environmental matters will, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Governmental Regulations

Our operations are subject to regulation,
supervision and licensing under various federal, provincial,
state and local statutes, ordinances and regulations. The
acquisition and sale of damaged and recovered stolen vehicles is
regulated by state and provincial motor vehicle departments. In
addition to the regulation of sales and acquisitions of
vehicles, we are also subject to various local zoning
requirements with regard to the location of our auction and
storage facilities. These zoning requirements vary from location
to location. At various times, we may be involved in disputes
with local governmental officials regarding the development
and/or operation of our business facilities. We believe that we
are in compliance in all material respects with applicable
regulatory requirements. We may be subject to similar types of
regulations by federal, provincial, state, and local
governmental agencies in new markets.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved in litigation and damage claims
arising in the ordinary course of business, such as actions
related to injuries, property damage or handling or disposal of
vehicles. Among this litigation is a lawsuit filed in
Massachusetts against us which purports to be a class action on
behalf of persons whose vehicles were disposed of by us as
abandoned vehicles, which the claimant contends were disposed of
without complying with state laws.

We are also involved in various governmental and
administrative proceedings primarily relating to licensing and
operation of our business. We provide for costs relating to
these matters when a loss is probable and the amount may be
reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters
on our future results of operations cannot be predicted because
any such effect depends on future results of operations, the
amount and timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is
not feasible to determine the outcome of these matters,
management believes that any ultimate liability will not have a
material effect on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.



FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE
RESULTS

We depend on a limited number of major
suppliers of salvage vehicles. The loss of one or more of these
major suppliers could adversely affect our results of operations
and financial condition, and an inability to increase our
sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth
rates.

Historically, a limited number of vehicle
suppliers have accounted for a substantial portion of our
revenues. In fiscal 2004, vehicles supplied by our two largest
suppliers accounted for approximately 12% and 8% of our
revenues, respectively. Supplier arrangements are either written
or oral agreements typically subject to cancellation by either
party upon 30 to 90 days notice. Vehicle suppliers have
terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets,
which has affected the pricing for auction services in those
markets. There can be no assurance that our existing agreements
will not be cancelled. Furthermore, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to enter into future agreements with
vehicle suppliers or that we will be able to retain our existing
supply of salvage vehicles. A reduction in vehicles from a
significant vehicle supplier or any material changes in the
terms of an arrangement with a substantial vehicle supplier
could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, a failure to
increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect
our earnings and revenue growth rates.

Our strategic shift from live salvage auctions
to an entirely Internet based sales model presents new risks,
including substantial technology risks.

In fiscal 2004, we converted all our salvage
auctions from a live auction process to an entirely Internet
based auction-style model based on technology developed
internally by us. The conversion represents a significant change
in the way we conduct business and presents numerous risks,
including our increased reliance on the availability and
reliability of our network systems. In particular, we believe
the conversion presents the following risks, among others:



Factors such as mild weather conditions in the
United States can have an adverse affect on our revenues and
operating results as well as our revenue and earnings growth
rates.

Mild weather conditions in the United States tend
to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage
vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer
automobiles are damaged. Accordingly, mild weather can have an
adverse effect on our salvage vehicle inventories, which would
be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and
earnings and related growth rates and could have an adverse
effect on our operating results. Conversely, our inventories
will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or
as a result of adverse weather-related conditions such as
flooding. During periods of mild weather conditions, our ability
to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and
related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to
obtain additional vehicle suppliers and to compete more
effectively in the market, each of which is subject to the other
risks and uncertainties described in these sections.

The salvage vehicle auction industry is highly
competitive and we may not be able to compete
successfully.

We face significant competition for the supply of
salvage vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles. We
believe our principal competitors include other vehicle auction
companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles
from insurance companies and other suppliers, and large vehicle
dismantlers, who may buy salvage vehicles directly from
insurance companies, bypassing the salvage auction process. Many
of the insurance companies have established relationships with
competitive auction companies and large dismantlers. Many of our
competitors may have greater financial resources than us. Due to
the limited number of vehicle suppliers, the absence of
long-term contractual commitments between us and our suppliers
and the increasingly competitive market environment, there can
be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share
at our expense.

We may also encounter significant competition for
local, regional and national supply agreements with vehicle
suppliers. There can be no assurance that the existence of other
local, regional or national contracts entered into by our
competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our
business or our expansion plans. Furthermore, we are likely to
face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of
salvage vehicle auction facilities, which could significantly
increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially
impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations. These potential new
competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling
businesses, organized salvage vehicle buying groups, automobile
manufacturers, automobile auctioneers and software companies.
While most vehicle suppliers have abandoned or reduced efforts
to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service
providers such as us, there can be no assurance that this trend
will continue, which could adversely affect our market share,
results of operations and financial condition. Additionally,
existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have
greater financial and marketing resources than us; therefore,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
successfully in the future.

Because the growth of our business has been
due in large part to acquisitions and development of new salvage
vehicle auction facilities, the rate of growth of our business
and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully
complete acquisitions and development of new
facilities.

We seek to increase our sales and profitability
through the acquisition of other salvage vehicle auction
facilities and the development of new salvage vehicle auction
facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to:

•

continue to acquire additional facilities on
    favorable terms;



As we continue to expand our operations, our
failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely
affect our results of operations and financial
condition.

Our ability to manage growth is not only
dependent on our ability to successfully integrate new
facilities, but also on our ability to:

Our inability to control or manage these growth
factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition.

We have limited experience in the public
automobile auction business and may not be successful in our
efforts to compete in this market, which may adversely affect
our current growth strategy.

We have historically focused on the operation,
acquisition and development of salvage vehicle auction
facilities and only have limited experience in operating public
automobile auction facilities. The public automobile auction
market differs from the salvage vehicle auction market in that
used vehicles in general working order are sold to the public.
We intend to expand our public automobile auction facilities
through the acquisition of public auction sites and the
successful implementation of VB


and cannot know
whether our existing salvage auction business model will
translate successfully into the public automobile auction
market. To the extent that we cannot successfully compete in the
public automobile auction market, our growth strategy could be
harmed.

Our annual and quarterly performance may
fluctuate, causing the price of our stock to decline.

Our revenues and operating results have
fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to
fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a
result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our
control. Factors that may affect our operating results include,
but are not limited to, the following:

•

fluctuations in the market value of salvage and
    used vehicles;

•

the availability of salvage vehicles;

•

variations in vehicle accident rates;



Due to the foregoing factors, our operating
results in one or more future periods can be expected to
fluctuate. As a result, we believe that period-to-period
comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily
meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of
future performance. In the event such fluctuations result in our
financial performance being below the expectations of public
market analysts and investors, the price of our common stock
could decline substantially.

Government regulation of the salvage vehicle
auction industry may impair our operations, increase our costs
of doing business and create potential liability.

Participants in the salvage vehicle auction
industry are subject to, and may be required to expend funds to
ensure compliance with a variety of U.S. or Canadian, federal,
state, provincial and local governmental, regulatory and
administrative rules, regulations, land use ordinances,
licensure requirements and procedures, including those governing
vehicle registration, the environment, zoning and land use.
Failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes
in interpretations of existing regulations may result in
impairment of our operations and the imposition of penalties and
other liabilities. At various times, we may be involved in
disputes with local governmental officials regarding the
development and/or operation of our business facilities. We
believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with
applicable regulatory requirements. We may be subject to similar
types of regulations by federal, provincial, state, and local
governmental agencies in new markets. In addition, new
regulatory requirements or



changes in existing requirements may delay or
increase the cost of opening new facilities, may limit our base
of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our
vehicles.

The operation of our auction facilities poses
certain environmental risks, which could adversely affect our
results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations are subject to federal, state,
provincial and local laws and regulations regarding the
protection of the environment. In the salvage vehicle auction
industry, large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at
auction facilities and, during that time, spills of fuel, motor
oil and other fluids may occur, resulting in soil, surface water
or groundwater contamination. Environmental issues resulting
from fuel spills, oil spillage, or similar problems are also
present at our public auction facilities. In addition, certain
of our facilities generate and/or store petroleum products and
other hazardous materials, including waste solvents and used
oil. We could incur substantial expenditures for preventative,
investigative or remedial action and could be exposed to
liability arising from our operations, contamination by previous
users of certain of our acquired facilities, or the disposal of
our waste at off-site locations. Environmental laws and
regulations could become more stringent over time and there can
be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to
significant costs in the future. Although we have obtained
indemnification for pre-existing environmental liabilities from
many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired
facilities, there can be no assurance that such indemnifications
will be adequate. Any such expenditures or liabilities could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

If we experience problems with our providers
of fleet operations, our business could be harmed.

We rely upon independent subhaulers to pick up
and deliver vehicles to and from our auction facilities. Our
failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate
manner could harm our reputation and brand, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business. Further, an increase in
fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our
independent subhaulers, which may significantly increase our
cost. These costs may not be passed on to our sellers or buyers.

We are partially self-insured for certain
losses.

We are partially self-insured for certain losses
related to general liability, workers’ compensation and
auto liability. Our liability represents an estimate of the
ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date.
The estimated liability is not discounted and is established
based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates.
While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the
information currently available, if actual trends, including the
severity of claims and medical cost inflation, differ from our
estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Further,
we rely on independent experts to assist us in establishing the
proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated
with these self-insured exposures. If these experts provide
guidance based on erroneous assumptions, use models
mathematically flawed or otherwise provide advice that is
inaccurate or unrepresentative, then it could have an adverse
impact on our results of operations.

Our executive officers, directors and their
affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their
interests may differ from other shareholders.

Our executive officers, directors and their
affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 21%
of our common stock as of July 31, 2004. If they were to
act together, these shareholders would have significant
influence over



most matters requiring approval by shareholders,
including the election of directors, any amendments to our
articles of incorporation and certain significant corporate
transactions, including potential merger or acquisition
transactions. In addition, without the consent of these
shareholders, we could be delayed or prevented from entering
into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other
investors. These shareholders may take these actions even if
they are opposed by our other investors.

We have a shareholder rights plan, or poison
pill, which could affect the price of our common stock and make
it more difficult for a potential acquirer to purchase a large
portion of our securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy
contest, or to acquire us.

In March 2003, our board of directors adopted a
shareholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill. The
poison pill may discourage, delay, or prevent a third party from
acquiring a large portion of our securities, initiating a tender
offer or proxy contest, or acquiring us through an acquisition,
merger, or similar transaction. Such an acquirer could be
prevented from consummating one of these transactions even if
our shareholders might receive a premium for their shares over
then-current market prices.

If we lose key management or are unable to
attract and retain the talent required for our business, we may
not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our
objectives.

Our future success depends in large part upon the
leadership and performance of our executive management team, all
of whom are employed on an at-will basis and none of whom are
subject to any agreements not to compete. If we lose the service
of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, in
particular Willis J. Johnson, our Chief Executive Officer, and
A. Jayson Adair, our President, or if one or more of them
decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or
indirectly with us, we may not be able to successfully manage
our business or achieve our business objectives.

Compliance with new rules and regulations
concerning corporate governance may be costly and time
consuming.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or
Sarbanes-Oxley, requires, among other things, that companies
adopt new corporate governance measures and imposes
comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, sets
stricter independence and financial expertise standards for
board and audit committee members and imposes increased civil
and criminal penalties for companies, their chief executive
officers and chief financial officers for securities law
violations. In addition, the Nasdaq National Market, on which
our common stock is traded, has adopted additional comprehensive
rules and regulations relating to corporate governance. These
laws, rules and regulations will increase the scope, complexity
and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure
practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert
management’s attention from business operations. These new
rules and regulations may also make it more difficult and more
expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability
insurance and make it more difficult for us to attract and
retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly
to serve on our audit committee.

In the event we are unable to satisfy
regulatory requirements relating to internal controls, or if
these internal controls over financial reporting are not
effective, our business and our stock price could
suffer.

Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires
companies to do a comprehensive and costly evaluation of their
internal controls. As a result, during our fiscal year ending
July 31, 2005, we will be required to perform an evaluation
of our



internal controls over financial reporting and
have our auditor publicly attest to such evaluation. We have
prepared an internal plan of action for compliance, which
includes a timeline and scheduled activities with respect to
preparation of such evaluation. Our efforts to comply with
Section 404 and related regulations regarding our
management’s required assessment of internal control over
financial reporting and our independent auditors’
attestation of that assessment has required, and continues to
require, the commitment of significant financial and managerial
resources. While we anticipate being able to fully implement the
requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects
of Section 404 in a timely fashion, we cannot be certain as
to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and
remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations
since there is no precedent available by which to measure
compliance adequacy. If we fail to timely complete this
evaluation, or if our auditors cannot timely attest to our
evaluation, we could be subject to regulatory investigations or
sanctions, costly litigation or a loss of public confidence in
our internal controls, which could have an adverse effect on our
business and our stock price.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters are located in
Fairfield, California. This facility consists of approximately
100,000 square feet of office space owned by Copart. We
also own or lease an additional 107 operating facilities in the
United States and Canada located in California, Texas, Arkansas,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Washington, Oregon, Georgia, Missouri,
New York, Connecticut, Florida, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maryland, Ohio, Illinois,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Mississippi, North Carolina, Indiana,
Arizona, Louisiana, Utah, Nevada, Alabama, South Carolina, Iowa,
Michigan, Tennessee, Virginia, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico,
Kentucky, Delaware, Maine, West Virginia, Montana, Alaska and
Ontario. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to
meet current requirements and that suitable additional or
substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any
expansion of operations and additional offices.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved in litigation and damage claims
arising in the ordinary course of business, such as actions
related to injuries, property damage or handling or disposal of
vehicles. Among this litigation is a lawsuit filed in
Massachusetts against us which purports to be a class action on
behalf of persons whose vehicles were disposed of by us as
abandoned vehicles, which the claimant contends were disposed of
without complying with state laws.

We are also involved in various governmental and
administrative proceedings primarily relating to licensing and
operation of our business. We provide for costs relating to
these matters when a loss is probable and the amount may be
reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters
on our future results of operations cannot be predicted because
any such effect depends on future results of operations, the
amount and timing of the resolution of such matters. While it is
not feasible to determine the outcome of these matters,
management believes that any ultimate liability will not have a
material effect on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

Overview

We provide vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance
companies, with a full range of services to process and sell
salvage vehicles through auctions, principally to licensed
vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle
dealers and exporters. Salvage vehicles are either damaged
vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or business purposes
or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance
settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made. We
offer vehicle suppliers a full range of services that expedite
each stage of the salvage vehicle auction process and minimize
administrative and processing costs. We generate revenues
primarily from auction fees paid by vehicle suppliers and
vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as
towing and storage.

We process salvage vehicles principally on a
consignment method, on either the Percentage Incentive Program
(“PIP”) or on a fixed fee consignment basis. Using
either consignment method, only the fees associated with vehicle
processing are recorded in revenue.

For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, approximately 65%, 67% and 67% of the vehicles we
sold, respectively, were processed under PIP. We attempt to
convert vehicle supplier agreements at acquired operations to
PIP, which typically results in higher net returns to vehicle
suppliers and higher fees to us than standard fixed fee
consignment programs. Those vehicles not sold under the PIP
program were processed under fixed fee agreements.

Due to a number of factors, including the timing
and size of new acquisitions, market conditions, and acceptance
of PIP by vehicle suppliers, the percentage of vehicles
processed under these programs in future periods may vary.

Our revenues consist of salvage fees charged to
vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers, transportation revenue and
purchased vehicle revenues. Salvage fees from vehicle suppliers
include fees under PIP agreements and fixed fee programs where
we charge for title processing, special preparation, storage and
selling. Salvage fees also include fees charged to vehicle
buyers for purchasing vehicles, storage and annual registration.
Transportation revenue includes charges to suppliers for towing
vehicles under fixed fee contracts. Transportation revenue also
includes towing charges



assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles.
Purchased vehicle revenues are comprised of the price that
buyers paid at our auctions for vehicles processed that we own.

Costs attributable to yard and fleet expenses
consist primarily of operating personnel (which includes yard
management, clerical and yard employees), rent, contract vehicle
towing, insurance, fuel, fleet maintenance and repair, and costs
of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts. Costs associated
with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of
executive, accounting and data processing, sales personnel,
human resources, professional fees and marketing expenses.

During fiscal 2004, we converted all of our
salvage vehicle auction facilities to an Internet based
auction-style model using our Virtual Bidding Second Generation
(“VB


”) Internet sales technology. This
second generation technology combines two bidding processes. An
open Preliminary Bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids
either at a bidding station at the auction facility during the
three preview days or over the Internet. To improve the
effectiveness of bidding, the VB


system lets a buyer
see the current high bid on the vehicle they want to purchase.
The preliminary bidding phase is an open sales format. Buyers
enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle
and BID4U will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf.
Preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an
Internet-only virtual sale. BID4U will represent the high
preliminary bidder at the Internet-only virtual sale. This
feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other
and the high preliminary bidder. The bidders enter bids via the
Internet in a real time format. BID4U submits bids for the high
preliminary bidder, up to their maximum bid. When bidding stops,
a countdown is initiated. If no bids are received during the
countdown, the vehicle sells to the highest bidder.
VB


opens our sales process to registered buyers
anywhere in the world who have Internet access.

We believe the implementation of VB


across our salvage operations has increased the pool of
available buyers for each sale and the added competition has
increased the amount buyers are willing to pay for salvage from
us. It has also improved the efficiency of our operations. For
fiscal 2004, sales of vehicles to buyers outside the state where
the vehicle is located accounted for 41% of total vehicles sold;
24% of salvage vehicles were sold to out of state buyers and 17%
were sold to buyers out of country.

The period-to-period comparability of our
operating results and financial condition is substantially
affected by business acquisitions and new openings made by us
during such periods.

Acquisitions and New Operations

We have experienced significant growth as we have
acquired twelve vehicle auction facilities and established
twelve new facilities since the beginning of fiscal 2002. All of
these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting.

As part of our overall expansion strategy of
offering integrated service to vehicle suppliers, we anticipate
acquiring and developing facilities in new regions, as well as
the regions currently served by our facilities. As part of this
strategy, in fiscal 2004 we acquired new facilities in or near
Eugene, Oregon; Cleveland, Ohio and Anchorage, Alaska and opened
new facilities in or near Toronto, Canada and Helena, Montana.
In fiscal 2003, we acquired new facilities in or near
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Reno, Nevada and Richmond, Virginia
and opened new facilities in or near Springfield, Missouri;
Corpus Christi, Texas; Ft. Pierce, Florida; Rancho
Cucamonga, California; Richmond, Virginia and Albany, New York.
In fiscal 2002, we acquired new facilities in or near New
Castle, Delaware; Savannah, Georgia; Tifton, Georgia;
Charleston, West Virginia; Haslet, Texas and Greencastle,
Pennsylvania and opened new facilities in or near Lyman,



Maine; Tucson, Arizona; Somerville, New Jersey
and Amarillo, Texas. We believe that these acquisitions and
openings strengthen our coverage as we have 107 facilities
located in North America and are able to provide national
coverage for our suppliers.

We seek to increase revenues and profitability
by, among other things, (i) acquiring and developing new
salvage vehicle auction facilities in key markets,
(ii) pursuing national and regional vehicle supply
agreements, (iii) expanding our service offerings to
suppliers and buyers, (iv) increasing revenue and
profitability at our public automobile auction facilities and
(v) expanding the application of VB


into new
markets. In addition, we implement our pricing structure and
merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost efficiencies
at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our
operational procedures, integrating our management information
systems and redeploying personnel, when necessary.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,
including those related to vehicle pooling costs, allowance for
doubtful accounts, goodwill, income taxes and long-lived assets.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting
policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

We defer, in vehicle pooling costs, certain yard
and fleet expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and
received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date. We
quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes
the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and
end of the period, the number of vehicles sold during the period
and an allocation of certain yard and fleet expenses of the
period. The primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain
facility costs, labor, transportation, and vehicle processing.
If our allocation factors change, then yard and fleet expenses
could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future. These
costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent
periods on an average cost basis.

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in
order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed
amounts billed to suppliers or buyers and the inability of our
suppliers or buyers to make required payments. If billing
disputes exceed expectations and/or if the financial condition
of our suppliers or buyers were to deteriorate, additional
allowances may be required.

We evaluate separately the impairment of goodwill
of our salvage and our public auction operating segments,
annually by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to
its carrying value. In prior years, we evaluated impairment of
goodwill at the facility level by comparing the fair value of
the reporting unit to its carrying value. During fiscal 2004,
when we centralized the auction process with the implementation
of VB


, we determined the appropriate level for
testing for impairment was at the salvage and public auction
levels. Under this accounting policy, we have not recognized any
charges for the impairment of goodwill in previous years or the
current year. Future adverse changes in



market conditions or poor operating results of an
operating segment could result in an inability to recover the
carrying value of the investment, thereby requiring an
impairment charge in the future.

We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax
assets on an ongoing basis. Generally accepted accounting
principles require the assessment of the Company’s
performance and other relevant factors when determining the need
for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax
assets. The Company’s ability to realize deferred tax
assets is dependent on its ability to generate future taxable
income. Accordingly, the Company has established a valuation
allowance when, in certain taxable jurisdictions, the
utilization of the tax asset is uncertain. Additional timing
differences, future earning trends and/or tax strategies may
occur which could warrant a need for establishing an additional
valuation allowance or a reserve.

We are also required to estimate income tax
provisions and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in
numerous jurisdictions. Such estimates involve significant
interpretations of regulations and are inherently very complex.
Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions
may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal
year.

We evaluate long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If the estimated undiscounted future
cash flows change in the future, we may be required to reduce
the carrying amount of an asset in the future.

We are partially self-insured for certain losses
related to general liability, workers’ compensation and
auto liability. Our liability represents an estimate of the
ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date.
The estimated liability is not discounted and is established
based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates.
While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the
information currently available, if actual trends, including the
severity of claims and medical cost inflation, differ from our
estimates, our results of operations could be impacted.



Results of Operations

The following table sets forth for the periods
indicated below, certain information derived from our
consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of
revenues. There can be no assurance that any trend in operating
results will continue in the future.

Fiscal 2004
Compared to Fiscal 2003

Revenues were approximately $400.8 million
during fiscal 2004, an increase of approximately
$53.4 million, or 15%, over fiscal 2003. The increase was
due primarily to increased salvage vehicle volume, new service
revenue and higher fees resulting from increased auction
proceeds per vehicle. We believe the increase in proceeds per
vehicle was the result of the introduction of Virtual Bidding
Second Generation “VB


” as more buyers are
able to participate in the auctions. Existing facilities
contributed approximately $52.0 million of new revenue and
new facilities (identified below), contributed approximately
$1.4 million of new revenue.

New facilities in or near Toronto, Canada;
Eugene, Oregon; Helena, Montana; Cleveland, Ohio and Anchorage,
Alaska contributed approximately $1.4 million of new
revenue during fiscal 2004.

Yard and fleet expenses were approximately
$208.8 million during fiscal 2004, an increase of
approximately $6.3 million, or 3%, over fiscal 2003.
Included in yard and fleet expense is a net adjustment to
insurance reserves that decreased this expense by
$4.4 million. The increase in yard and fleet expenses was
due principally to the cost of handling increased volume at
existing operations and the costs of new facilities.
Approximately $2.1 million of the increase was the result
of the acquisition and opening of new facilities. Yard and fleet
expenses from existing facilities, excluding the
$4.4 million favorable adjustment to reserves, grew by
approximately $8.6 million, or 4%. Yard and fleet expenses
decreased to 52% of revenues during fiscal 2004, as compared to
58% of revenues during fiscal 2003. Yard and fleet expenses
decreased as a percentage of revenue and was due in part to the
fixed cost nature of Copart’s business. The decrease in
yard and fleet expenses, as a percentage or revenue, was offset
by an increase in general and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses were
approximately $36.5 million during fiscal 2004, an increase
of approximately $7.8 million, or 27%, over fiscal 2003.
The increase was primarily due to increases in software
development cost, technology hardware leasing cost, and IT
payroll costs, all directly associated with the development



and deployment of VB


. In addition,
the company saw increases in the cost of professional services,
impacted by Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and increased payroll and
benefit costs associated with expanded support headcount.
General and administrative expenses increased to 9% of revenues
during fiscal 2004, as compared to 8% of revenues during fiscal
2003.

Depreciation and amortization expense was
approximately $30.8 million during fiscal 2004, an increase
of approximately $5.3 million, or 21%, over fiscal 2003.
This increase was due primarily to depreciation and amortization
of capital expenditures and covenants not to compete and
depreciation of acquired assets resulting from the acquisition
of new auction facilities.

Total other income was approximately
$5.5 million during fiscal 2004, an increase of
approximately $2.1 million, or 62% from fiscal 2003. Gain
on sale of fleet equipment represents the gain on the sale of
602 vehicles. The sale of the equipment is associated with the
Company’s decision to replace its company owned trucks with
subhaulers for its towing services. Interest income decreased
approximately $0.1 million due to lower interest rates
during the first nine months of the fiscal year. Other income,
which consists primarily of rental income, increased
approximately $1.1 million as the company rented several
under-utilized facilities.

Our effective combined federal, state and local
income tax rate for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 was
approximately 39%.

Due to the foregoing factors, we realized net
income of approximately $79.2 million for fiscal 2004,
compared to net income of approximately $57.2 million for
fiscal 2003.

Fiscal 2003
Compared to Fiscal 2002

Revenues were approximately $347.4 million
during fiscal 2003, an increase of approximately
$31.0 million, or 10%, over fiscal 2002. The increase was
due primarily to increased volume at existing facilities, which
contributed approximately $24.1 million in revenue and to
new facilities (identified below), which contributed
approximately $6.9 million of new revenue.

New facilities in or near West Mifflin,
Pennsylvania; Reno, Nevada; Richmond, Virginia; Springfield,
Missouri; Corpus Christi, Texas; Ft. Pierce, Florida;
Rancho Cucamonga, California; Richmond, Virginia and Albany, New
York contributed approximately $6.9 million of new revenue
during fiscal 2003.

Yard and fleet expenses were approximately
$202.4 million during fiscal 2003, an increase of
approximately $15.5 million, or 8%, over fiscal 2002. The
increase in yard and fleet expenses was due principally to the
cost of handling increased volume at existing operations and the
costs of new facilities. Approximately $7.3 million of the
increase was the result of the opening and operating of new
facilities. Yard and fleet expenses from existing facilities
grew by approximately $8.2 million, or 4%, compared to
existing facility revenue growth of approximately
$24.1 million, or 8%. Yard and fleet expenses decreased to
58% of revenues during fiscal 2003, as compared to 59% of
revenues during fiscal 2002.

General and administrative expenses were
approximately $28.7 million during fiscal 2003, an increase
of approximately $5.4 million, or 23%, over fiscal 2002.
This increase was due primarily to an increase of approximately
$2.5 million in payroll expense, $1.0 million in
professional services, $0.6 million in frame connectivity
charges and $1.3 million in various other general and
administrative items. General and administrative expenses
increased to 8% of revenues during fiscal 2003, as compared to
7% of revenues during fiscal 2002.



Depreciation and amortization expense was
approximately $25.5 million during fiscal 2003, an increase
of approximately $9.2 million, or 57%, over fiscal 2002.
This increase was due primarily to depreciation and amortization
of capital expenditures and covenants not to compete and
depreciation of acquired assets resulting from the acquisition
of new auction facilities. Growth in capital spending in fiscal
2003 and prior periods is expected to result in increased
depreciation and amortization expense in future periods.

Total other income was approximately
$3.4 million during fiscal 2003, a decrease of
approximately $0.3 million, or 8% from fiscal 2002. The
decrease is due primarily to a reduction in the gain from the
sale of certain fixed assets of approximately $0.5 million.
Interest income decreased approximately $0.2 million due to
lower interest rates and a reduction in the cash balance. These
decreases were offset by an increase in rental income of
approximately $0.4 million.

Our effective combined federal, state and local
income tax rate for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 was 39%.

Due to the foregoing factors, we realized net
income of approximately $57.2 million for fiscal 2003,
compared to net income of approximately $57.4 million for
fiscal 2002.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, we have financed our growth through
cash generated from operations, public offerings of common
stock, the equity issued in conjunction with certain
acquisitions and debt financing. Cash and cash equivalents
increased by approximately $61.6 million in fiscal 2004 and
decreased by approximately $15.9 million in fiscal 2003.
Our liquidity and capital resources have not been materially
affected by inflation. During the winter months, most of our
facilities process 10% to 30% more vehicles than at other times
of the year. This increased seasonal volume requires the
increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs
of the additional business.

As of July 31, 2004, we had working capital
of approximately $229.9 million, including cash and cash
equivalents of approximately $178.3 million. Our primary
source of cash is from the collection of sellers’ fees,
buyers’ fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of
auctioned salvage vehicles.

We believe that our currently available cash,
cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under
our bank credit facilities and equipment leasing lines will be
sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital
requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, if
we experience significant growth in the future, we may be
required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new
debt or additional equity.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities
increased by $36.1 million from fiscal 2003 to
$115.2 million in fiscal 2004, due to the timing of routine
changes in working capital items and profitability of the
company.

Investing Activities

Capital expenditures (excluding those associated
with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions) were
approximately $64.6 million, $70.7 million and
$85.9 million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Our capital expenditures have related primarily to opening and
improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment. In addition,
in fiscal 2004, the company sold most of its transportation
fleet as it moved to outsource this function. Sale of fleet
equipment generated approximately $19.0 million in gross
proceeds.



During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004,
we used cash for the acquisition of operations in Eugene,
Oregon; Cleveland, Ohio and Anchorage, Alaska, which had an
aggregate cash cost of approximately $4.7 million. During
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2003, we used cash for the
acquisition of operations in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania; Reno,
Nevada and Richmond, Virginia, which had an aggregate cash cost
of approximately $6.6 million. During the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2002, we used cash and common stock for the
acquisition of operations in New Castle, Delaware; Savannah,
Georgia; Tifton, Georgia; Charleston, West Virginia; Haslet,
Texas and Greencastle, Pennsylvania. The consideration paid
consisted of an aggregate cash cost of approximately
$8.6 million and approximately $25.7 million in common
stock.

During fiscal year ended July 31, 2002, we
used common stock to purchase an existing facility, which we
were leasing. The consideration paid consisted of approximately
$2.3 million in common stock.

Financing Activities

In fiscal 2002, we completed a follow-on public
offering of 6.9 million shares of our common stock at a
price to the public of $19.33 per share, split adjusted. We
sold all of the shares and the offering raised
$126.1 million after underwriting discounts and offering
costs.

In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we generated
approximately $5.1 million, $0.4 million and
$1.1 million, respectively, through the exercise of stock
options.

In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we generated
approximately $1.3 million, $1.9 million and
$1.7 million, respectively, through the issuance of shares
under the employee stock purchase program.

In February 2003, the Company’s Board of
Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to
9 million shares of its Common Stock. The repurchases may
be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions. No time
limit has been placed on the duration of the share repurchase
program. The repurchases will be made at such times and in such
amounts, as Copart deems appropriate and may be discontinued at
any time. As of July 31, 2004 the Company had repurchased a
total of 3,672,300 shares at a weighted average price of
$8.49. The Company repurchased a total of 977,100 shares at
a weighted average price of $10.974 during the fiscal year
ending July 31, 2004. For the year ended July 31,
2003, the Company had repurchased a total of
2,695,200 shares at a weighted average price of
$7.59 per share. The Company accounted for the repurchase
of its Common Stock by charging Common Stock for $31,170,400. As
of October 1, 2004, the company has not repurchased any
shares in fiscal 2005.

Lease, Purchase and Other Contractual
    Obligations

The following table summarizes our significant
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of
July 31, 2004:



(1)

Contractual obligations consist of long-term debt
    and future minimum lease payments under capital and operating
    leases, including off-balance sheet leases, used in the normal
    course of business.

(2)

Commercial commitments include primarily letters
    of credit provided for insurance programs and certain business
    transactions.

Credit Facilities

On February 23, 2001, we entered into a
credit facility with our existing banking syndicate. The
facility provided by Wells Fargo Bank, Fleet National Bank and
U.S. Bank National Association consists of an unsecured
revolving reducing line of credit in the amount of
$75 million that matures in 2006. As of July 31, 2004,
the Company had available $63.5 million under this
facility, after taking into account $11.5 million of
outstanding letters of credit. We are subject to customary
covenants, including the following financial covenants:
1) ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); 2) profitable
operation; 3) leverage ratio and 4) interest coverage
ratio. The Company is in compliance with all covenants.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk

Our principal exposures to financial market risk
are interest rate and foreign currency risk. Our exposure to
market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to
our investment portfolio of marketable securities. Our exposure
to foreign currency risks relates to our operations in Canada,
which have not been significant. We do not hedge our exposure to
the Canadian dollar. We do not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. We invest
primarily in corporate securities, bank certificates,
U.S. Treasury and Agency Obligations, asset-backed
securities, repurchase agreements, auction rate debt instruments
and money market mutual funds and generally hold them to
maturity. Consequently, we do not expect any material loss with
respect to our investment portfolio.

We do not use derivative financial instruments in
our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk. We do,
however, limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by
establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and
guidelines for our fixed income portfolios. At the present time,
the maximum average duration of all portfolios is 90 days
or less. Our guidelines also establish credit quality standards,
limits on exposure to any one issue as well the type of
instruments. Due to the limited duration and credit risk
criteria in our guidelines, we do not expect that our exposure
to market and credit risk will be material.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Copart, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Copart, Inc. and subsidiaries (“the
Company”) as of July 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’
equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended July 31, 2004. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we have also audited the related financial statement
schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Copart, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of July 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended July 31, 2004, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and
    Practices

Description of Business

Copart, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“the
Company”) provide vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance
companies, with a full range of services to process and sell
salvage vehicles through auctions, principally to licensed
vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle
dealers and exporters.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries.
Significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues, which generally consist of salvage fees
charged to vehicle suppliers and buyers, are generally recorded
at the date the vehicles are sold at auction. No provision for
returns has been established, as all sales are final with no
right of return.

When the Company bills suppliers under fixed fee
contracts for various services which may include tow fees,
storage, title processing and various other salvage fees prior
to the vehicles sale at auction, we defer the revenue because we
are not entitled to those revenues until the vehicle is sold.

Yard and Fleet Expenses

Yard and fleet expenses consist primarily of
operating personnel (which includes yard management, clerical
and yard employees), rent, contract vehicle towing, insurance,
fuel, fleet maintenance and repair, and the cost of vehicles
acquired and sold by the Company under purchase contracts.

General and Administrative
    Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of executive, accounting and data processing, sales
personnel, professional fees, software and product development
and marketing expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with original maturities of three months
or less to be cash equivalents.

Vehicle Pooling Costs

Vehicle pooling costs consist of labor, towing,
certain facility costs, outside services and other costs
directly attributable to the gathering and processing of
vehicles prior to their sale. Vehicle pooling costs are
recognized as



COPART, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expenses in the period the vehicle is sold at
auction. The Company continually evaluates and adjusts the
components of vehicle pooling costs as necessary.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Leasehold
improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of the lease terms or the useful lives of the respective
assets.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of: 3 to 7 years for
transportation and other equipment; 5 to 10 years for
office furniture and equipment; and 15 to 40 years or life
of lease, whichever is shorter, for buildings and leasehold
improvements.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist of covenants not to
compete. Amortization is provided on the straight-line basis
over the life of the covenant, which ranges from 5 to
7 years.

Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments

The amounts recorded for financial instruments in
the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which
include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, accrued liabilities and capital lease obligations
approximate fair value as of July 31, 2004 and 2003.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset
and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the enactment date.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share amounts were computed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share amounts were
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding plus dilutive potential common
shares calculated for stock options outstanding using the
treasury stock method.



COPART, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for its stock-based employee
compensation plans using the intrinsic-value-based method
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”

(“APB 25”), and related interpretations, as
allowed under SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation”

(“SFAS 123”)
as amended by SFAS No. 148,

“Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosure”

(“ SFAS 148”). Accordingly,
compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair
value of the Company’s stock at the date of the grant over
the price the employee must pay to acquire the stock. Options
granted to consultants and other non-employees are accounted for
at fair value.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company
adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS 148, which
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary
change to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. The Statement also amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements
about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and
the effect of the methods used on reported results.

Pro forma information regarding net income and
net income per share is required by SFAS No. 123, and
has been determined as if the Company had accounted for options
granted under its plans using the fair value method. For these
purposes, the fair value of options issued under the Plans was
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following assumptions: no dividend yield,
volatility factor of the expected market price of the
Company’s stock of 0.41, a forfeiture rate of 0.08, a
weighted-average expected life of the options of five years and
a risk-free interest rate of 3.3%, 2.9% and 4.3% for 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. The weighted average fair value of
options granted were $3.66, $2.97 and $5.12, for 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the
estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over
the options vesting period. The effects of applying
SFAS No. 123 in this pro forma disclosure are not
indicative of future results.



COPART, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For purposes of pro forma disclosures under
SFAS 123 and SFAS 148, the estimated compensation
expense related to option grants to employees that would have
been recognized in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 is deducted from
net income. The Company’s pro forma information related to
option grants to employees as calculated in accordance with
SFAS 123 and SFAS 148 is as follows:

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes income adjusted for
certain revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are excluded
from net income under generally accepted accounting principles.
Examples include foreign currency translation adjustments and
unrealized gains and losses on certain derivatives. The Company
has no items of other comprehensive income in 2003 and 2002.
Therefore, net income as presented in the consolidated
statements of income equals comprehensive income for those years.

Segment Reporting

The Company’s two operating segments,
salvage auction and public auction, are aggregated into one
reportable segment given the similarities of economic
characteristics between the operations represented by the
facilities and the common nature of the products, customers and
methods of revenue generation.

Use of Estimates

Management of the Company has made a number of
estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.



COPART, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Business Combinations and
    Goodwill

The Company accounts for business combinations
and goodwill according to Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 141, “Business Combinations,” and
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase
method of accounting be used for all business combinations and
that certain acquired intangible assets be recognized as assets
apart from goodwill. The adoption of SFAS No. 141 had
no impact on the Company’s results of operations or
financial position. SFAS No. 142 provides that
goodwill should not be amortized but instead be tested for
impairment annually at the operating segment level. In prior
years the Company evaluated impairment of goodwill at the
facility level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit
to its carrying value. During fiscal 2004, when the Company
centralized the auction process with the implementation of
VB


, the Company determined the appropriate level for
testing for impairment was at the salvage and public auction
levels. The Company’s annual impairment test was performed
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The results of this test
indicated that goodwill was not impaired.

The change in carrying amount of goodwill is as
follows:

Impairment of Long-Lived
    Assets

The Company evaluates long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the property and
equipment exceeds its fair market value.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
years’ financial statements to conform to the
classifications used in 2004.

The Company reclassified $4,677,200 in land
purchase options from current to long-term assets in its fiscal
2003 consolidated balance sheet, to reflect the non-current
nature of those assets. This change in presentation has no
material effect on any operating or financial metrics.

Acquisitions

Fiscal 2004 Transactions

During fiscal 2004 the Company made the following
four acquisitions: Brasher’s Northwest Auto Auction, Inc.
of Eugene, Oregon; Spooner Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a Insured
Salvage Pool, of Reno, Nevada; Joe Horisk Salvage Pool Systems
of Ohio, Cleveland, Ohio and Alaska Towing and Wrecking of
Anchorage, Alaska. The consideration paid for these acquisitions
consisted of $4,733,000 in cash. The acquired net assets
consisted of accounts and advances receivable, vehicle pooling
costs, fixed assets, land, buildings, goodwill, and covenants
not to compete. The acquisitions were accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting, and the operating results
subsequent to the acquisition dates are included in the
Company’s consolidated statements of income. These new
facilities contributed $1.4 million of revenues during
fiscal 2004. The excess of the purchase price over the fair
market value of the net identifiable assets acquired of
$3,634,500 has been recorded as goodwill. The Company estimates
the entire goodwill balance relating to these acquisitions will
be deductible for tax purposes. In addition, the Company paid
$190,000 for covenants not to compete relating to these
acquisitions, which are being amortized over five years, based
upon the agreements. In conjunction with the Eugene, Oregon;
Reno, Nevada and Anchorage, Alaska acquisitions, the Company
entered into leases for the use of these facilities at fair
value.

Fiscal 2003 Transactions

During fiscal 2003 the Company made the following
three acquisitions: Greater Pittsburgh Auto Auction, Inc. of
West Mifflin, Pennsylvania; E.W.E. Salvage Pool & Auto
Auction, Inc. of Reno, Nevada and Richmond Auto Auction of
Virginia, Inc. of Richmond, Virginia. The consideration paid for
these acquisitions consisted of $6,604,000 in cash. The acquired
net assets consisted of accounts and advances receivable,
vehicle pooling costs, fixed assets, land, buildings, goodwill,
and covenants not to compete. The acquisitions were accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting, and the operating
results subsequent to the acquisition dates are included in the
Company’s consolidated statements of income. These new
facilities contributed $5.1 million of revenues during
fiscal 2003. The excess of the purchase price over the fair
market value of the net identifiable assets acquired of
$5,784,300 has been recorded as goodwill. The Company estimates
the entire goodwill balance relating to these acquisitions will
be deductible for tax purposes. In addition, the Company paid
$426,700 for covenants not to compete relating to these
acquisitions, which are being amortized over five to seven
years, based upon the agreements. In conjunction with the West
Mifflin, Pennsylvania; Reno, Nevada and Richmond, Virginia
acquisitions, the Company entered into leases for the use of
these facilities at fair value.

Fiscal 2002 Transactions

During fiscal 2002 the Company made the following
six acquisitions: Delaware Public Auto Auction, of New Castle,
Delaware; Sadisco, of Savannah, Georgia; Sadisco of Tifton,
Georgia; Capital Auto Salvage, of Charleston, West Virginia;
North Texas Insurance Auto Auction, L.P., of Haslet, Texas and
Mason-Dixon Auto Auction, of Greencastle, PA. The consideration
paid for these acquisitions consisted of $8,561,100 in cash and
1,550,987 shares of common stock valued at approximately
$25,691,900. The acquired net assets consisted of accounts and
advances receivable, vehicle pooling costs, inventory, fixed
assets, land, buildings, goodwill, and covenants not to compete.
The acquisitions were



COPART, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting, and the operating results subsequent to the
acquisition dates are included in the Company’s
consolidated statements of income. These new facilities
contributed $11.6 million of revenues during fiscal 2002.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of
the net identifiable assets acquired of $20,166,700 has been
recorded as goodwill. The Company estimates $16,566,700 of the
total goodwill balance relating to these acquisitions will be
deductible for tax purposes. In addition, the Company paid
$2,100,000 for covenants not to compete relating to these
acquisitions, which are being amortized over five to seven
years, based upon the agreements. In conjunction with the New
Castle, Delaware; Savannah, Georgia; Tifton, Georgia;
Charleston, West Virginia and Haslet, Texas acquisitions, the
Company entered into leases for the use of these facilities at
fair value.

Pro forma financial information for the 2004 and
2003 acquisitions does not result in a significant change from
actual results.

(3)

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable consists of the following:

Advance charges receivable represents amounts
paid to third parties on behalf of insurance companies for which
the Company will be reimbursed when the vehicle is sold. Trade
accounts receivable includes fees and gross proceeds to be
collected from insurance companies and buyers.

(4)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment consists of the following:

Included in property and equipment as of
July 31, 2004 and 2003 are $31,200 and $1,025,700,

Accounts Payable and Accrued
    Liabilities

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities consists
of the following:

Accrued insurance liability represents an
estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the
balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted
and is established based upon analysis of historical data,
including the severity of or frequency of claims, actuarial
estimates and is reviewed periodically by management to ensure
that the liability is appropriate. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, the Company reduced its accrual for self insured
claims based upon new information and analyse regarding the
expected severity and frequency of claims, this resulted in a
$4.4 million reduction to yard and fleet expense. The
Company experienced a reduction in the severity and frequency of
claims, which reduced the ultimate cost of claims.

U.S. Bank National Association consists of an unsecured
revolving reducing line of credit in the amount of
$75 million that matures in 2006. As of July 31, 2004,
the Company had available $63.5 million under this
facility, after taking into account $11.5 million of

customary covenants, including the following financial
covenants: 1) ratio of funded debt to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA);
2) profitable operation; 3) leverage ratio and
4) interest coverage ratio. The Company is in compliance
with all covenants.

(8)

Shareholders’ Equity

In fiscal 2002, the Company completed a follow-on
public offering of 6.9 million shares of common stock at a
price to the public of $19.33 per share. The Company sold
all of the shares and the offering raised $126.1 million
after underwriting discounts and offering costs.

In December 2001, the Company adopted the Copart,
Inc. 2001 Stock Option Plan (“Plan”), presently
covering an aggregate of 4,500,000 shares of the
Company’s Common Stock. The Plan provides for the grant of
incentive stock options to employees and non-qualified stock
options to employees, officers, directors and consultants at
prices not less than 100% and 85% of the fair market value for
incentive and non-qualified stock options, respectively, as
determined by the Board of Directors at the grant date.
Incentive and non-qualified stock options may have terms of up
to ten years and vest over periods determined by the Board of
Directors. Options generally vest ratably over a five-year
period. The Plan replaces the Company’s 1992 Stock Option
Plan (“1992 Plan”), which expired in August 2002.



COPART, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

In March 1994, the Company adopted the Copart,
Inc. 1994 Director Option Plan under which an aggregate of
240,000 shares of the Company’s common stock are
presently reserved. In general, new non-employee directors will
automatically receive grants of non-qualified stock options to
purchase 18,000 shares and subsequent grants to
purchase 9,000 additional shares upon election and each
subsequent re-election to the Company’s board of directors,
respectively. In August 2003, the Company terminated the
1994 Director Option Plan.

The Company has authorized the issuance of
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value, none of
which are issued or outstanding at July 31, 2003.

The Copart, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(“ESPP”) provides for the purchase of up to an
aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock of the
Company by employees pursuant to the terms of the ESPP. The
number of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the ESPP
during each of fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 135,735, 204,753
and 117,033, respectively.

In February 2003, the Company’s Board of
Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to
9 million shares of its Common Stock. The repurchases may
be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions. No time
limit has been placed on the duration of the share repurchase
program. The repurchases will be made at such times and in such
amounts, as Copart deems appropriate and may be discontinued at
any time. As of July 31, 2004, the Company had repurchased
a total of 3,672,300 shares at a weighted average price of
$8.49. The Company repurchased a total of 977,100 shares at
a weighted average price of $10.974 during the fiscal year
ending July 31, 2004. For the year ended July 31,
2003, the Company had repurchased a total of
2,695,200 shares at a weighted average price of
$7.59 per share.

In March 2003, the Company’s Board of
Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan. Under the plan, the
Company will issue a dividend of one right for each share of its
common stock held by shareholders of record as of the close of
business on Friday, March 21, 2003.

deferred tax liabilities are presented below, as of July 31:

The above net deferred tax liability as of

sheets as follows:

The Company’s ability to realize deferred
tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate future
taxable income. Accordingly, the Company has established a
valuation allowance in one taxable jurisdiction as the
utilization of the tax asset is uncertain. Additional timing
differences, future earnings trends and/or tax strategies may
occur which could warrant a need for establishing an additional
valuation allowance.

The Company is under a routine income tax audit
in one state for the 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax years.
Management believes that adequate amounts have been provided for
any adjustments that may ultimately result from these
examinations.

In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company
recognized a tax benefit of $1,603,900, $377,700 and $2,817,300,
respectively, upon the exercise of certain stock options which
is reflected in shareholders’ equity.

The net change in the valuation allowance for the

calculating diluted net income per share. The table below
reconciles basic weighted shares outstanding to diluted weighted
average shares outstanding:

121,500 shares of common stock at an average price of
$17.91, $13.68 and $21.55 per share were outstanding during
the fiscal years ended July 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, but were not included in the computation of

price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Noncancelable future minimum lease payments under
capital and operating leases with initial or remaining lease
terms in excess of one year at July 31, 2004 are as follows:

Commitments

The Company had outstanding letters of credit of
$11.5 million at July 31, 2004. These letters of
credit secure certain insurance obligations.

Contingencies

The Company is involved in litigation and damage
claims arising in the ordinary course of business, such as
actions related to injuries, property damage or handling or
disposal of vehicles. Among this litigation is a lawsuit filed
in Massachusetts against the Company which purports to be a
class action on behalf of persons whose vehicles were disposed
of by the Company as abandoned vehicles, which the claimant
contends were disposed of without complying with state laws.

The Company is also involved in various
governmental and administrative proceedings primarily relating
to licensing and operation. The Company provides for costs
relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount
may be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these
matters on the Company’s future results of operations
cannot be predicted because any such effect depends on future
results of operations, the amount and timing of the resolution
of such matters. While it is not feasible to determine the
outcome of these matters, management believes that any ultimate
liability will not have a material effect on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
