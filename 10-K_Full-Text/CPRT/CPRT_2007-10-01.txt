PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Copart, Inc.
is a leading provider of vehicle remarketing services in the United States (US)
and the United Kingdom (UK).

We provide
vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance companies, with a full range of
remarketing services to process and sell salvage vehicles primarily over the
Internet through our Virtual Bidding Second Generation Internet auction-style
sales technology, which we refer to as VB


. We sell principally to licensed vehicle
dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle dealers and exporters.
Salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not
economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen
vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already
been made. We offer vehicle suppliers a full range of remarketing services that
expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize
administrative and processing costs. In the US we sell vehicles primarily as an
agent and derive revenue primarily from sales transaction fees paid by vehicle
suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as
towing and storage. In the UK we operate primarily on a principal basis,
purchasing the salvage vehicle outright from the insurance companies and
reselling the vehicle to buyers through a combination of live auctions and
Internet sales. We intend to implement VB


at our UK
facilities where appropriate during fiscal 2008.

We have grown
our salvage business through a combination of acquisitions, the development of
new facilities and also by increasing our buyer base and implementing
additional value-added services for both buyers and suppliers. For fiscal year
2007, which ended July 31, 2007, our revenues were approximately $560.7
million and our operating income was approximately $203.1 million. On June 14,
2007, we acquired Universal Salvage plc, or Universal. Universal, based in the
UK, operates seven salvage yards in the UK and is a leading provider of vehicle
remarketing services to the motor insurance and automotive industries.
Universal specializes in the disposal of accident-damaged, End-of-Life,
fee-based non-salvage vehicles. On August 1, 2007, we acquired Century
Salvage Sales Limited, or Century, in the UK. Century operates three salvage
yards in the UK. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2007, we opened
three new salvage vehicle storage facilities located in Baltimore, Maryland;
Woodburn, Oregon and Punta Gorda, Florida. During the year we also closed one
facility, located in Grand Island, Nebraska. As of July 31, 2007, we had
123 facilities in the US, 1 facility in Canada and 7 facilities in the UK.

During fiscal
2004, we converted all of our North American salvage vehicle storage facilities
to an Internet based auction-style model using VB


. This second generation
technology combines two bidding processes. An open Preliminary Bidding feature
allows a buyer to enter bids either at a bidding station at the storage
facility during the preview days or over the Internet. To improve the
effectiveness of bidding, the VB


system lets a buyer see the current high bid
on the vehicle they want to purchase. The preliminary bidding phase is an open
sales format. Buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a
vehicle and VB


’s
BID4U feature will


incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf. Preliminary bidding ends
one hour prior to the start of an Internet-only virtual sale. BID4U will
represent the high preliminary bidder at the Internet-only virtual sale. This
feature allows bidders the opportunity to bid against each other and the high
preliminary bidder. The bidders enter bids via the Internet in a real time
format. BID4U submits bids for the high preliminary bidder, up to their maximum
bid. When bidding stops, a countdown is initiated. If no bids are received
during the countdown, the vehicle sells to the highest bidder. VB


opens our sales process to registered buyers
anywhere in the world who have Internet access.

We believe the
implementation of VB


across our North
American salvage operations has increased the pool of available buyers for each
sale and the added competition has increased the amount buyers are willing to
pay for vehicles from us. We also believe that it has improved the efficiency of
our operations by eliminating the expense and capital requirements associated
with live auctions. For fiscal 2007, sales of North American vehicles, on a
unit basis, to buyers outside the state where the vehicle is located accounted
for 50.8% of total vehicles sold (25.1% of salvage vehicles were sold to out of
state buyers and 25.7% were sold to out of country buyers, based on
registration). As we integrate our recent UK acquisitions we intend to
implement VB


at our UK facilities where appropriate. We can
not predict whether the implementation of VB


in the UK will have the same favorable
impact on our buyer base and operating efficiencies that we experienced in the
US.

We believe that we offer the highest level of
service in the salvage vehicle sales and remarketing industry and have
established our leading market position by:

·

providing
coverage that facilitates supplier access to buyers around the world, reducing
towing and third-party storage expenses, offering a local presence for vehicle
inspection stations, and providing prompt response to catastrophes and natural
disasters by specially-trained teams;

·

providing
a comprehensive range of customer services that include merchandising services,
efficient title processing, timely pick-up and delivery of vehicles and
Internet sales;

·

establishing
and efficiently integrating new facilities and acquisitions;

·

increasing
the number of bidders that can participate at each sale through the ease and
convenience of Internet bidding;

·

applying
technology to enhance operating efficiency through Internet bidding, web-based
order processing, salvage value quotes, electronic communication with buyers
and sellers, vehicle imaging and an electronic used vehicle parts locator
service; and

·

providing
the venue for insurance customers through our Virtual Insured Exchange “VIX”
product to enter a vehicle into a live virtual sale to establish its true
value,  allowing the insurance customer
to avoid dealing with estimated values when negotiating with owners who wish to
retain their damaged vehicles.


We adopted a
formal plan in fiscal 2006 to discontinue the operations of Motors Auction
Group, or MAG, a wholly owned subsidiary, and dispose of the related assets or
convert them to our salvage business. We operated six public automobile sales
facilities located in Detroit, Michigan; Chesapeake, Virginia; New Castle,
Delaware; Greencastle, Pennsylvania; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Richmond,
Virginia. We sold the businesses located in Chesapeake, New Castle and
Greencastle prior to the end of fiscal 2006. We converted Detroit, Pittsburgh
and Richmond into salvage facilities. As of the end of fiscal 2006, no MAG
operations remained.

We were incorporated in California in 1982 and became a public company
in 1994. Our principal executive offices are located at 4665 Business Center
Drive, Fairfield, California 94534, and our telephone number at that address is
(707) 639-5000. We maintain a website,

http://www.copart.com

,
where we make available, free of charge, our code of ethics, other corporate
information, and our SEC filings, including our annual reports on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K,
and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we
electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission. We are providing the address to our website solely for the
information of investors. Information contained on our website is not
incorporated by reference herein and our web address is included as an inactive
textual reference only.

Industry Overview

The salvage
vehicle industry provides a venue for salvage vehicle suppliers to liquidate
total loss vehicles. In the United States and Canada, salvage vehicle sales
companies generally auction or sell salvage vehicles on consignment either for
a fixed fee or a percentage of the sales price. On occasion in the US and
Canada and on a primary basis in the UK, salvage sales companies will purchase
vehicles from vehicle suppliers at a formula-based price, based usually either
on a percentage of the vehicles’ estimated pre-loss actual cash value and/or
based on the extent of damage and sell the vehicles for their own account.
Salvage vehicle sales companies typically operate from one or more salvage
facilities where vehicles are processed, viewed, stored and sold. However, in
the United States and Canada, Copart, through the introduction of VB


, eliminated local live auctions,
and we now sell all of our salvage vehicles over the Internet. In the UK,
Copart sells vehicles though a combination of live auctions and Internet sales.

Although there
are other suppliers of salvage vehicles, such as financial institutions,
vehicle leasing companies, automobile rental companies, charities and
automobile dealers, the primary source of salvage vehicles is insurance
companies.

Automobile
manufacturers are incorporating new standard features, including unibody
construction, passenger safety cages with surrounding crumple zones to absorb
impacts, plastic components, airbags, xenon lights, computer systems, heated
seats and navigation systems. We believe that one effect of these additional
features is that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more costly to repair
and, accordingly, more likely to be deemed a total loss for insurance purposes.
This could result in an increasing supply of total loss salvage vehicles in the
future.


The primary
buyers of salvage vehicles are vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair
licensees, used vehicle dealers and exporters. Vehicle dismantlers, which we
believe are the largest group of salvage vehicle buyers, either dismantle a
vehicle and sell parts individually or sell the entire vehicle to rebuilders,
used vehicle dealers or the public. Vehicle rebuilders and vehicle repair
licensees generally purchase salvage vehicles to repair and resell. Used
vehicle dealers generally purchase recovered stolen or slightly damaged
vehicles for resale.

Following an
accident involving an insured vehicle, the damaged vehicle is generally towed
to a storage facility or a vehicle repair facility for temporary storage
pending insurance company examination. The vehicle is inspected by the
insurance company’s adjuster, who estimates the costs of repairing the vehicle
and gathers information regarding the damaged vehicle’s mileage, options and
condition in order to estimate its actual cash value (fair market value). The
adjuster determines whether to pay for repairs or to classify the vehicle as a
total loss based upon the adjuster’s estimate of repair costs and the vehicle’s
salvage value, as well as customer service considerations. If the cost of
repair is greater than the actual cash value less the estimated salvage value,
the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss. The
insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a salvage vehicle sales
company, settle with the insured vehicle owner and receive title to the
vehicle.

We believe the primary factors that vehicle
suppliers consider when selecting a salvage vehicle sales company include:

·

the
anticipated percentage return on salvage (i.e., gross salvage proceeds, minus
vehicle handling and selling expenses, divided by the actual cash value);

·

the
services provided by the salvage vehicle sales company and the degree to which
such services reduce administrative costs and expenses;

·

the
price the salvage vehicle sales company charges for its services;

·

national
coverage and ability to respond on a national scale;

·

the
ability to generate custom seller reports; and

·

in
the UK, the percentage of the actual cash value paid for the vehicle.

In the UK,
insurance companies generally tender periodic contracts for the purchase of
salvaged vehicles. The salvage company that is willing to pay the highest price
for the vehicles will generally be awarded the contract.

Generally, upon
receipt of the pick up order (the assignment), the salvage vehicle sales
company arranges for the transport of a vehicle to a facility. In North
America, as a service to the vehicle supplier, the salvage vehicle sales
company will customarily pay advance charges (reimbursable charges paid on
behalf of vehicle suppliers) to obtain the subject vehicle’s release from a
towing company or vehicle repair facility. Typically, advance charges paid on
behalf of the vehicle supplier are recovered upon sale of the salvage vehicle.


The vehicle then remains in storage at our facility until ownership
documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the
vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory
agency, or DMV. Generally total loss vehicles may be sold in most states only
after obtaining a salvage title from the DMV. Upon receipt of the appropriate
documentation from the DMV, which is generally received within 45 to 60 days of
vehicle pick-up, the vehicle is sold either on behalf of the insurance company
of for our own account, depending on the terms of the contract. In the UK, upon
release of interest by the vehicle owner, the insurance company notifies us
that the vehicle is available for sale.

Operating and Growth Strategy

Our growth
strategy is to increase our revenues and profitability by, among other things (i) acquiring
and developing new salvage vehicle storage facilities in key markets including
foreign markets, (ii) pursuing national and regional vehicle supply
agreements, (iii) expanding our remarketing service offerings to suppliers
and buyers and (iv) expanding the application of VB


into new markets. In addition, to maximize
gross sales proceeds and cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities
we introduce our (i) pricing structure, (ii) selling processes, (iii) operational
procedures, (iv) management information systems and, when necessary, (v) redeploy
existing personnel.

As part of our overall expansion strategy, our objective is to increase
our revenues, operating profits and market share in the vehicle sales industry.
To implement our growth strategy, we intend to continue to do the following:

Acquire and Develop New Salvage Vehicle
Storage Facilities in Key Markets Including Foreign Markets

Our strategy is
to offer integrated services to vehicle suppliers on a national or regional
basis by acquiring or developing salvage facilities in new and existing
markets. When appropriate we integrate our new acquisitions into our global
network and capitalize on certain operating efficiencies resulting from, among
other things, the reduction of duplicative overhead and the implementation of
our operating procedures.

Pursue National
and Regional Vehicle Supply Agreements

Our broad national presence enhances our ability to enter into local,
regional or national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers. We actively seek
to establish national and regional supply agreements with insurance companies
by promoting our ability to achieve high net returns and broader access to
buyers through our national coverage and electronic commerce capabilities. By
utilizing our existing insurance company supplier relationships, we are able to
build new supplier relationships and pursue additional supply agreements in
existing and new markets.


Expand Our
Service Offerings to Suppliers and Buyers

Over the past several years, we have expanded our available service offerings
to vehicle suppliers and buyers. The primary focus of these new remarketing
service offerings is to maximize returns to our suppliers and maximize product
value to our buyers. Recent service enhancements include, for our suppliers,
real-time access to sales data over the Internet and, for our buyers, the
implementation of VB


real-time bidding
at all of our North American facilities, permitting buyers at any location
worldwide to participate in the sales at all of our yards in North America.
We plan to continue to refine and expand our remarketing services, including
offering software that can assist our suppliers in expediting claims and
salvage management tools that help suppliers integrate their systems with ours.

Our Competitive Advantages

We believe that the following attributes and the services that we offer
position us to take advantage of many opportunities in the salvage vehicle
remarketing service industry.

National
Coverage and Ability to Respond on a National Scale

Since our inception in 1982, we have expanded
from a single facility in Vallejo, California to an integrated network of 131
facilities located in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom as of July 31,
2007. We are able to offer integrated services to our vehicle suppliers, which
allows us to respond to the needs of our suppliers and buyers with maximum
efficiency. Our coverage provides our suppliers with key advantages, including:

·

a reduction in
administrative time and effort;

·

a reduction in overall
vehicle towing costs;

·

convenient local
facilities;

·

improved access to buyers
throughout the world;

·

a prompt response in the
event of a natural disaster or other catastrophe; and

·

consistency
in remarketing of salvage vehicles.

Value-Added
Services

We believe that we offer the most
comprehensive range of remarketing services in our industry, including:

·

Internet bidding, Internet
proxy bidding and virtual sales powered by VB


, which enhance the competitive bidding
process;

·

online payment
capabilities via our ePay product;

·

e-mail notifications to
potential buyers of salvage vehicles that match desired characteristics;


·

sophisticated vehicle
processing at storage sites, including ten-view digital imaging of each vehicle
and the scanning of each vehicle’s title and other significant documents such
as body shop invoices, all of which are available from us through the Internet;

·

CoPartfinder, our
Internet-based used vehicle parts locator that provides vehicle dismantlers
with greater resale opportunities for their salvage purchases;

·

Specialty sales, which
allow buyers the opportunity to focus on select types of vehicles: i.e.
motorcycles, heavy equipment, boats, recreational vehicles and rental cars; and

·

Interactive
Online Counter Bidding, which allows sellers who have placed a minimum bid or a
bid to be approved on a vehicle to directly counter bid the current high
bidder.

Proven Ability
to Acquire and Integrate Acquisitions

We have a proven track record of successfully
acquiring and integrating salvage vehicle storage facilities. Since becoming a
public company in 1994, we have completed the acquisition of 74 salvage vehicle
storage facilities both in North America and the UK. As part of our acquisition
and integration strategy, we seek to:

·

expand our global
presence;

·

strengthen our networks
and access new markets;

·

utilize our existing
corporate and technology infrastructure over a larger base of operations; and

·

introduce our
comprehensive services and operational expertise.

We strive to integrate all new facilities, when appropriate, into our
existing network without disruption of service to vehicle suppliers. We work
with new suppliers to implement our fee structures and new service programs. We
typically retain existing employees at acquired facilities in order to retain
knowledge about, and respond to, the local market. We also assign a special
integration team to help convert newly acquired facilities to our own
management information and proprietary software systems, enabling us to ensure
a smooth and consistent transition to our business operating and sales systems.

Technology to
Enhance and Expand Our Business

We have developed management information and proprietary software
systems that allow us to deliver a fully integrated service offering. Our
proprietary software programs provide vehicle suppliers with online access to
data and reports regarding their salvage vehicles being processed at any of our
facilities. This technology allows vehicle suppliers to monitor each stage of
our salvage vehicle sales process, from pick up to sale and settlement by the
buyer. Our full range of Internet services allows us to expedite each stage of
the salvage vehicle sales process and minimizes the administrative and
processing costs for us as well as our suppliers. We believe that our
integrated technology systems generate improved capacity and financial returns
for our clients, resulting in high client retention, and allow us to expand our
national supply contracts.


Our Service Offerings

We offer vehicle suppliers a full range of vehicle remarketing
services, which expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process,
maximizing proceeds and minimizing costs. Not all service offerings are
available in all markets.

Online Supplier
Access

Through Copart Access, our Internet-based service for vehicle
suppliers, we enable suppliers to assign vehicles for sale, check sales
calendars, view vehicle images and history, view and reprint body shop invoices
and towing receipts and view the historical performance of the vehicles sold at
our sales.

Salvage
Estimation Services

We offer Copart ProQuote, a proprietary service that assists suppliers
in the vehicle claims evaluation process by providing online salvage value
estimates, which helps suppliers determine whether to repair a particular
vehicle or deem it a total loss.

Estimating
Services

We offer vehicle suppliers in the UK estimating services for vehicles
taken to our sites. Estimating services provide our insurance company suppliers
repair estimates which allows the insurance company to determine if the vehicle
is a total loss vehicle. If the vehicle is determined to be a total loss, it is
assigned to inventory.

End-of-Life
Vehicle Processing

In the UK, Universal is an authorized treatment facility, or ATF, for
the disposal of End-of-Life vehicles, or ELVs.

Virtual Insured
Exchange (VIX)

We provide the venue for insurance customers to enter a vehicle into a
live virtual auction-style sale to establish its true value, thereby allowing
the insurance customer to avoid dealing with estimated values when negotiating
with owners who wish to retain their damaged vehicles.

Transportation
Services

We maintain contracts with third-party vehicle transport companies,
which enables us to pick up most of our suppliers’ vehicles within 24 hours.
Our national network and transportation capabilities provides cost and time
savings to our vehicle suppliers and ensures on-time vehicle pick up and prompt
response to catastrophes and natural disasters in North America. In the UK, we
perform transportation services primarily utilizing our employees and our fleet
of over 100 vehicles.


Vehicle
Inspection Stations

We offer certain of our major insurance company suppliers office and
yard space to house vehicle inspection stations on-site at our storage
facilities. We have over 30 vehicle inspection stations at our facilities. An
on-site vehicle inspection station provides our insurance company suppliers
with a central location to inspect potential total loss vehicles, which reduces
storage charges that otherwise may be incurred at the initial storage or repair
facility.

On-Demand
Reporting

We provide vehicle suppliers with on-demand reports online, via fax or
e-mail that summarize data on salvage vehicles that we process for the
particular supplier. These reports track our vehicle suppliers’ gross and net
returns on each vehicle, service charges, and other data that enable our
vehicle suppliers to more easily administer and monitor the salvage vehicle
disposition process. In addition, we have developed a database containing over
240 fields of real-time and historical information accessible by our insurance
customers allowing for their generation of custom ad hoc reports and customer
specific analysis.

DMV Processing

We have extensive expertise in DMV document and title processing for
salvage vehicles. We have developed a computer system which provides a direct
link to the DMV computer systems of several states. This allows us to expedite
the processing of vehicle title paperwork.

Flexible
Vehicle Processing Programs

At the election
of the vehicle supplier, we sell vehicles pursuant to our Percentage Incentive
Program (PIP), Consignment Program or Purchase Program.

Percentage Fee Consignment.

Our Percentage Incentive Program is an innovative
processing program designed to broadly serve the needs of vehicle suppliers.
Under PIP, we agree to sell all of the salvage vehicles of a vehicle supplier
in a specified market, usually for a predetermined percentage of the vehicle
sales price. Because our revenues under PIP are directly linked to the vehicle’s
sale price, we have an incentive to actively merchandise those vehicles to
maximize the net return on salvage vehicles. We provide the vehicle supplier,
at our expense, with transport of the vehicle to our nearest facility, storage
for up to 90 days and DMV document and title processing. In addition, we
provide merchandising services such as covering or taping openings to protect
vehicle interiors from weather, washing vehicle exteriors, vacuuming vehicle
interiors, cleaning and polishing dashboards and tires, making keys for
drivable vehicles and identifying drivable vehicles. We believe our
merchandising efforts increase the sales prices of salvage vehicles, thereby
increasing the return on salvage vehicles to both vehicle suppliers and us.


Consignment Program.

Under our consignment program, we sell vehicles for a
fixed consignment fee. Although sometimes included in the consignment fee, we
may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our
facility, storage of the vehicle, and other incidental costs.

Purchase Program.

Under

the purchase
program, we purchase vehicles from a vehicle supplier at a formula price, based
on a percentage of the vehicles’ estimated pre-accident value (PAV), or “actual
cash value” (ACV), and sell the vehicles for our own account.

Buyer Network

We maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage
vehicles in the vehicle dismantling, rebuilding, repair, resale and exporting
businesses. Our database includes each buyer’s vehicle preference and
purchasing history. This data enables us to notify via e-mail prospective
buyers throughout the world of salvage vehicles available for bidding that
match their vehicle preferences. Listings of salvage vehicles to be sold on a
particular day and location are also made available on the Internet.

Sales Process

We offer a flexible and unique sales process designed to maximize the
sale prices of the vehicles. We utilize VB


, an auction-style sales methodology that
we developed. This second generation technology combines two bidding processes.
An open Preliminary Bidding feature allows a buyer to enter bids either at a
bidding station at the storage facility during the three preview days or over
the Internet. To improve the effectiveness of bidding, the VB


system lets a buyer see the current high bid
on the vehicle they want to purchase. The preliminary bidding phase is an open
sales format. Buyers enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a
vehicle and our BID4U feature will incrementally bid the vehicle on their
behalf. Preliminary bidding ends one hour prior to the start of an
Internet-only virtual sale. BID4U will represent the high preliminary bidder at
the Internet-only virtual sale. This feature allows bidders the opportunity to
bid against each other and the high preliminary bidder. The bidders enter bids
via the Internet in a real time format. BID4U submits bids for the high
preliminary bidder, up to their maximum bid. When bidding stops, a countdown is
initiated. If no bids are received during the countdown, the vehicle sells to
the highest bidder. VB


opens our sales process to registered buyers
anywhere in the world who have Internet access.

CoPartfinder

CoPartfinder is our unique Internet “search engine” that enables users
to locate used vehicle parts quickly and efficiently. CoPartfinder is
accessible by the public through a Copart-sponsored website. CoPartfinder lists
vehicles recently sold through VB


and
identifies certain purchasers. This allows vehicle dismantlers and other
resellers to streamline their parts sale process and access a large pool of
potential buyers. Parts buyers can use CoPartfinder to search for specific
vehicle makes and models and view digital images of vehicles that meet their
requirements. Once a specific parts supplier is identified for a specific part
requirement, buyers have the option


to call, fax, or e-mail the
dismantler/supplier. We believe that CoPartfinder provides an incentive for
vehicle dismantlers to purchase their salvage vehicles through our sales
process.

Supply Arrangements and Supplier Marketing

We obtain
salvage vehicles from hundreds of different vehicle suppliers. State Farm
Insurance Company accounted for 11%, 14% and 12% of our revenues for fiscal
years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Of the total number of vehicles that
we processed in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we obtained approximately
83%, 83% and 79%, respectively, from insurance company suppliers. Our
arrangements with our suppliers are typically subject to cancellation by either
party upon 30 to 90 days notice.

We typically
contract with the regional or branch office of an insurance company or other
vehicle suppliers. The agreements are customized to each vehicle supplier’s
particular needs and often provide for the disposition of different types of
salvage vehicles by differing methods. Our arrangements generally provide that
we will sell total loss and recovered stolen vehicles generated by the vehicle
supplier in a designated geographic area.

We market our services to vehicle suppliers through an in-house sales
force that utilizes a variety of sales techniques, including targeted mailing
of our sales literature, telemarketing, follow-up personal sales calls, and
participation in trade shows and vehicle and insurance industry conventions.
Based upon our historical data on salvage vehicles and vehicle information
supplied by vehicle suppliers, our marketing personnel will provide vehicle
suppliers with detailed analysis of the net return on salvage vehicles and a
proposal setting forth ways in which we believe that we can improve net returns
on salvage vehicles and reduce administrative costs and expenses.

Buyers

We maintain a database of thousands of registered buyers of salvage
vehicles in the vehicle dismantling, rebuilding, repair, resale and export
businesses. We believe that we have established a broad international and
domestic buyer base by providing buyers of salvage vehicles with a variety of
programs and services. To gain admission to one of our sales and become a
registered buyer, prospective buyers must first pay an initial registration fee
and an annual fee, provide requested personal and business information and
have, in most states, a vehicle dismantler’s, dealer’s, resale, repair or
export license. In certain venues we may sell to the public. Registration
entitles a buyer to transact business at any of our sales subject to local
licensing and permitting requirements. A buyer may also bring guests to a
facility for a fee to preview vehicles for sale. Strict admission procedures
are intended to prevent frivolous bids that would invalidate the sale. We
market to buyers on the Internet and via e-mail notifications, sales notices,
telemarketing and participation in trade show events.


Competition

We face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and
for the buyers of those vehicles. We believe our principal competitors include
vehicle auction and sales companies and vehicle dismantlers. These national,
regional and local competitors may have established relationships with vehicle
suppliers and buyers and may have financial resources that are greater than
ours. The largest national or regional vehicle auctioneers in North America
include the ADESA Corporation; Auction Broadcasting Company; Insurance Auto
Auctions, Inc.; Manheim Auctions and SADISCO. The largest national
dismantlers include Greenleaf and LKQ Corporation. These national dismantlers,
in addition to trade groups of dismantlers such as the American Recycling Association
and the United Recyclers Group, may purchase salvage vehicles directly from
insurance companies, thereby bypassing vehicle sales companies entirely,
including us. In the UK, our principal competitors are privately held
independent salvage companies.

Management Information Systems

Our primary
management information system consists of an IBM AS/400 mainframe computer
system, integrated computer interfaces and proprietary business operating
software that we developed and which tracks salvage sales vehicles throughout
the sales process. We have implemented our proprietary business operating
software at all of our North American salvage storage facilities. In addition,
we have integrated our mainframe computer system with Internet and Intranet
systems in order to provide secure access to our data and images in a variety
of formats.

Our
auction-style service product, VB


, is served by an array of identical
high-density, high-performance servers. Each individual sale is configured to
run on an available server in the array and can be rapidly provisioned to any
other available server in the array as required. Our sale, Internet and imaging
services are load balanced across different geographical data centers.

We have
invested in a production data center that is designed to run the business in
the event of an emergency. The facility’s electrical and mechanical systems are
continually monitored. This facility is located in an area considered to be
free of weather-related disasters and earthquakes.

The management information systems employed in the UK are a combination
of proprietary and licensed software and are independent and separate from
those in North America.

Employees

As of July 31, 2007, we had 2,536 full-time employees, of whom
approximately 381 were engaged in general and administrative functions and
approximately 2,155 were engaged in yard operations. As of July 31, 2007,
we had 2,198 and 338 employees located in North America and the UK,
respectively. We are not currently subject to any collective bargaining
agreements and believe our relationships with our employees are good.


Environmental Matters

Our operations
inside and outside the US are subject to various laws and regulations regarding
the protection of the environment. In the salvage vehicle remarketing industry,
large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at facilities and, during that
time, spills of fuel, motor oils and other fluids may occur, resulting in soil,
surface water or groundwater contamination. Certain of our facilities store petroleum
products and other hazardous materials in above-ground containment tanks and
some of our facilities generate waste materials such as solvents or used oils
that must be disposed of as non-hazardous or hazardous waste, as appropriate.
We have implemented procedures to reduce the amount of soil contamination that
may occur at our facilities, and we have initiated safety programs and training
of personnel on the safe storage and handling of hazardous materials. We
believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with all
applicable environmental regulations and we do not anticipate any material
capital expenditures to remain in environmental compliance. If additional or
more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, we could incur additional
capital expenditures.

In connection
with the acquisition of our Dallas, Texas facility in 1994, we set aside $3.0
million to cover the costs of environmental remediation, stabilization and
related consulting expenses for a six-acre portion of the facility that
contained elevated levels of lead due to the activities of the former
operators. We began the stabilization process in 1996 and completed it in 1999.
We paid all remediation and related costs from the $3.0 million fund and,
in accordance with the acquisition agreement, distributed the remainder of the
fund to the seller of the Dallas facility, less $0.2 million which was held
back to cover the costs of obtaining the no-further-action letter.
In September 2002, our environmental engineering consultant issued a
report, which concludes that the soil stabilization has effectively stabilized
the lead-impacted soil, and that the concrete cap should prevent impact to
storm water and subsequent surface water impact. Our consultant thereafter
submitted an Operations and Maintenance Plan (“Plan”) to the Texas Commission
on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) providing for a two-year inspection and
maintenance plan for the concrete cap, and a two-year ground and surface water
monitoring plan. In January of 2003, the TCEQ approved the Plan, subject
to the additions of upstream (background) surface water samples from the
intermittent stream adjacent to the facility and documentation of any repairs
to the concrete cap during the post closure-monitoring period. The first
semi-annual water sampling was conducted in April 2003, which reflected
that the lead-impacted, stabilized soil is not impacting the ground and/or
surface water. The second round of semi-annual water samples collected in October and
November 2003 reported concentration of lead in one storm water and one
surface water sample in excess of the established upstream criteria for lead.
In correspondence, which we received in July 2004, the TCEQ approved with
comment our water monitoring report dated February 24, 2004. The TCEQ
instructed us to continue with post-closure monitoring and maintenance
activities and submit the next report in accordance with the approved
schedules. In February 2005, a report from our environmental engineering
consultant was transmitted to the TCEQ containing the results of annual
monitoring activities consisting of two (2) semi-annual sampling events
which occurred in April/June 2004 and October/November 2004.
Laboratory analytical results indicated no lead concentrations exceeding the
target concentration level set in the Corrective Measures Study


for the site, but some results were in excess of Texas surface water
quality standards. The Company’s environmental engineering consultant concluded
in the February 2005 report to the TECQ that it is unlikely that lead
concentrations detected in the storm water runoff samples are attributable to
the lead impacted soils. Based on the results of the 2004 samplings, we
requested that no further action be taken and that a closure letter be issued
by the TCEQ. In September 2007, the TCEQ notified us that they did not
concur with our consultant’s conclusions and recommendations. The TCEQ said it
would not provide a closure letter until additional sampling of surface water
is performed which reflects concentrations of lead below Texas surface water
quality standards. This sampling is anticipated to be performed in September or
October, 2007. We are not assured of receiving the no-further-action letter and
we may incur further liabilities if the stabilization process proves
ineffective, or if later testing of surface or ground water reflects
concentrations of lead which exceed Texas surface or ground water quality
standards. In addition, in 1994, we detected a small quantity of two hazardous
substances in a temporary groundwater monitoring well at the Dallas facility.
Our environmental consultants concluded that both substances arose from an
off-site source and no further action was recommended.

We do not believe that any of the above environmental matters will,
either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Governmental Regulations

Our operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing
under various federal, national, international, provincial, state and local
statutes, ordinances and regulations. The acquisition and sale of damaged and
recovered stolen vehicles is regulated by various state, provincial and
international motor vehicle departments. In addition to the regulation of sales
and acquisitions of vehicles, we are also subject to various local zoning
requirements with regard to the location of our storage facilities. These
zoning requirements vary from location to location. At various times, we may be
involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the
development and/or operation of our business facilities. We believe that we are
in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements.
We may be subject to similar types of regulations by federal, national,
international, provincial, state, and local governmental agencies in new
markets.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved
in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business,
such as actions related to injuries, property damage, and handling or disposal
of vehicles. This litigation includes the following matters:

On September 16,
2005, Richard M. Gray filed suit against Copart of Connecticut, Inc. and
A. Safrin, in the State Court for the County of Chatham, State of Georgia,
alleging a class action for unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by
us, and related claims. Relief sought includes class certification, damages,
fees, costs and expenses. Our motion for summary judgment was heard on January 31,
2007 and was denied. We believe the claim is without merit, and are defending
the lawsuit vigorously.


On July 28,
2006, Foreign Car Sales and Service LLC (“FCS”) filed suit against Copart in
the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana,
originally alleging antitrust violations and unfair trade practices. Relief
sought originally included class certification based on both unfair trade
practices and Sherman Act violations, damages, fees, costs and expenses. On January 5,
2007, the Magistrate required FCS to amend its complaint. A First Amended
Complaint was rejected, and a Second Amended Complaint was submitted February 16,
2007, in which FCS abandoned its unfair trade practices claims, and now relies
simply on breach of contract claims. FCS continues to seek certification
of a class based upon violations of the Sherman Act. Plaintiff is in

pro se

and is demanding a total award of 51%
of our issued stock, as well as approximately $97,000 in damages arising from
damages to vehicles. We filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of subject
matter jurisdiction, improper venue, and failure to state a claim. We believe
the claims are without merit, and are defending the lawsuit vigorously.

On August 7,
2006, Kimberly and Jason Green filed suit against Copart in the Superior Court
of the State of California, County of Sacramento, making allegations pursuant
to a California consumer protection statute similar to a class action for
unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by us, and related claims.
Relief sought includes class certification, damages, fees, costs and expenses.
We filed an answer on September 1, 2006 denying the claim. On July 2,
2007, the parties entered into a settlement agreement terminating the lawsuit.

We accrue for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable
and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these
matters on our future results of operations cannot be predicted because any
such effect depends on future results of operations, the amount and timing of
the resolution of such matters. We believe that any ultimate liability will not
have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. However, the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims, if
any, cannot be determined with certainty.

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights

In June 2003,
we filed a provisional US patent application on VB


in the United States. This provisional patent
application was followed by a US utility application filed in July 2003
and a concurrent international application that has since been nationalized and
is pending in Canada, Australia, China, the European Union, Mexico and Japan.
Generally, patents issued in the US are effective for 20 years from the
earliest asserted filing date of the patent application. The duration of
foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local
law. We are not dependent upon any single patent application and there can be
no assurance that any patents will be issued from pending applications or that
any patents that are issued will provide meaningful protection or other
commercial advantages to us.


We also rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark
laws, as well as contractual agreements to safeguard our proprietary rights in
technology and products. In seeking to limit access to sensitive information to
the greatest practical extent, we routinely enter into confidentiality and
assignment of invention agreements with each of our employees and consultants
and nondisclosure agreements with our key customers and vendors.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Investing in
our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully
the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment
decision. Our business could be harmed if any of these risks as well as other
risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial,
materialized. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to the
occurrence of any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your
investment. In assessing the risks described below, you should also refer to
the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our
consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedule, and other
filings with the SEC before deciding to purchase any shares of our common
stock.

We depend on a
limited number of major suppliers of salvage vehicles. The loss of one or more
of these major suppliers could adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition, and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply
could adversely affect our growth rates.

Historically, a limited number of vehicle suppliers have accounted for
a substantial portion of our revenues. In fiscal 2007, vehicles supplied by our
largest supplier accounted for approximately 11% of our revenues. Supplier
arrangements are either written or oral agreements typically subject to
cancellation by either party upon 30 to 90 days notice. Vehicle suppliers have
terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets, which has
affected the pricing for sales services in those markets. There can be no
assurance that our existing agreements will not be cancelled. Furthermore,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements
with vehicle suppliers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of
salvage vehicles. A reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle supplier
or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a substantial
vehicle supplier could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, a failure to increase our
sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue
growth rates.


Our United
Kingdom acquisition of Universal Salvage plc on June 14, 2007 and our
subsequent acquisition of Century Salvage Sales Limited on August 1, 2007
will expose us to risks arising from the acquisitions and risks associated with
operating in markets outside North America. We may acquire additional companies
in the United Kingdom or Europe or seek to establish new yards or facilities to
complement the acquired companies’ operations. We have no prior experience
operating outside North America, and any failure to integrate these recently
acquired companies or future UK or European acquisitions into our operations
successfully could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

During fiscal
2007, we announced the acquisition of Universal Salvage plc, or Universal, our
first acquisition in the UK. Subsequently, in August 2007, we announced
the acquisition of Century Salvage Sales Limited, or Century, also in the UK. We
may acquire additional companies or operations in the UK or Europe or may seek
to establish new yards or operations in the UK or Europe now that we have
established a presence in these markets. We have no experience operating our
business outside North America, which presents numerous strategic, operating,
and financial risks to us.

Our recent
acquisitions in the UK and continued expansion of our operations outside North
America pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse
effect on our future operating results. In particular, we may not be successful
in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions, or we may
experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations
into our existing business. We may also incur substantial expenses establishing
new yards or operations in the UK or Europe. Among other things, we intend to
eventually deploy our VB


vehicle remarketing technologies at
all of our operations in the UK, where appropriate, and we cannot predict
whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the
revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their
historic operating performance. Integration of our respective operations,
including information technology integration and integration of financial and
administrative functions, may not proceed as we currently anticipate and could
result in presently unanticipated costs or expenses (including unanticipated
capital expenditures) that could have an adverse effect on our future operating
results. We cannot provide any assurances that we will achieve our business and
financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic
decision to expand our operations internationally.

We have no
experience operating our business outside North America and lack familiarity
with local laws, regulations and business practices. We will need to develop
policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale.
Operationally, the businesses of Universal and Century have depended on key
customer and supplier relationships, and we will need to maintain those. If we
fail to maintain those relationships it would have an adverse effect on our
operating objectives for the UK and could have an adverse effect on our future operating
results.


In addition, we anticipate our international
operations will subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on
an international basis, including:

·

the difficulty of managing
and staffing foreign offices and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal
compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;

·

the need to localize our
product offerings, particularly with respect to VB


;

·

tariffs and trade barriers
and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to operate in
certain foreign markets; and

·

exposure to foreign
currency exchange rate risk, which we have not been previously subject to in
any material amounts.

As we continue
to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our
ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated
with our international operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks
successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect
on our operating results.

The period-to-period comparability of our operating results and
financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions during
such periods. In particular, the UK acquisition, because of its size and, also,
because the UK operates primarily on the principal model versus the agency
model employed in the US, will have a significant impact on the comparability
of revenues, margins and margin percentages in future periods. Further
operating on a principal basis will have a negative impact on our future
consolidated gross margins.

In the UK we
operate primarily on a principal basis, purchasing the salvage vehicle outright
from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicle to buyers. This exposes
us to inventory risks including:

·

loss from theft or damage;

·

loss from devaluation; and

·

loss
from obsolescence.

Our strategic shift from live salvage sales
to an entirely Internet-based sales model presents new risks, including
substantial technology risks.

In fiscal 2004, we converted all our North
American salvage sales from a live auction process to an entirely
Internet-based auction-style model based on technology developed internally by
us. The conversion represents a significant change in the way we conduct
business and presents numerous risks, including our increased reliance on the
availability and reliability of our network systems. In particular, we believe
the conversion presents the following risks, among others:

·

Our operating results in a
particular period could be adversely affected in the event our networks are not
operable for an extended period of time for any reason, as a result of Internet
viruses, or as a result of any other technological circumstance that makes us
unable to conduct our virtual sales.


·

Our business is
increasingly reliant on internally developed technology, and we have limited
historic experience developing technologies or systems for large-scale
implementation and use.

·

Our general and
administrative expenses have tended to increase as a percentage of revenue as
our information technology payroll has increased.

·

The change in our business
model may make it more difficult for management, investment analysts, and
investors to model or predict our future operating results until sufficient
historic data is available to evaluate the effect of the VB


implementation over a longer period of time
and in different economic environments.

·

Our
increasing reliance on proprietary technology subjects us to intellectual
property risks, including the risk of third party infringement claims or the
risk that we cannot establish or protect intellectual property rights in our
technologies. We have filed patent applications for VB


in
the United States, the Netherlands, and Europe, but we cannot provide any
assurances that the patents will actually be issued, or if issued that the
patents would not later be found to be unenforceable or invalid.

Our results of operations may not continue to
benefit from the implementation of VB


to
the extent we have experienced in recent periods.

We believe that the implementation of our proprietary VB


sales technologies across our North America
salvage operations has had a favorable impact on our results of operations by
increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base and increasing the
average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales. VB


was
implemented across all our salvage yards beginning in the third quarter of
fiscal 2004. We do not believe, however, that we will continue to experience
improvements in our results of operations at the same relative rates we have
experienced in the last few years. In addition, we cannot predict whether we
will experience the same initial benefits from the implementation of VB


in the UK market, or in future markets we may
enter, that we experienced in North America.

Failure to have sufficient capacity to accept
additional cars at one or more of our salvage yards could adversely affect our
relationships with insurance companies or other suppliers of salvage vehicles.

Capacity at our salvage yards varies from period to period and from
region to region. For example, following adverse weather conditions in a
particular area, our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to
accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories. As
discussed below, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had an adverse effect on our
operating results, in part because of yard capacity constraints in the Gulf
Coast area. We regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and, where
appropriate, seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional
land and yards. We may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent
salvage yards in markets where we have limited excess capacity, and zoning
restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to
expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land. Failure to have
sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our
relationships with insurance companies or other suppliers of salvage vehicles,
which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.


Factors such as mild weather conditions can
have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well as our
revenue and earnings growth rates by reducing the available supply of salvage
vehicles. Conversely, extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of
salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to
market demands.

Mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available
supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer
automobiles are damaged. Accordingly, mild weather can have an adverse effect
on our salvage vehicle inventories, which would be expected to have an adverse
effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates.
Conversely, our inventories will tend to increase in poor weather such as a
harsh winter or as a result of adverse weather-related conditions such as
flooding. During periods of mild weather conditions, our ability to increase
our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be
increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle suppliers
and to compete more effectively in the market, each of which is subject to the
other risks and uncertainties described in these sections. In addition, extreme
weather conditions, although they increase the available supply of salvage
cars, can have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, during
the year ended July 31, 2006, we recognized substantial additional costs
associated with the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in Gulf Coast states.
These additional costs, characterized as “abnormal” under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards 151, were recognized during the year ended
July 31, 2006, and included the additional subhauling, payroll, equipment
and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by
the hurricanes. In the event that we were to again experience extremely adverse
weather or other anomalous conditions that result in an abnormally high number
of salvage vehicles in one or more of our markets, those conditions could have
an adverse effect on our future operating results.

High fuel
prices may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results as well
as our earnings growth rates.

Significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in
miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates. A material reduction in
accident rates could have a material impact on revenue growth. In addition,
under our percentage incentive program contracts, or PIP, the cost of towing
the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the PIP fee. We may incur
increased fees, which we will not be able to pass on to our suppliers of
salvage vehicles. A material increase in tow rates could have a material impact
on our operating results.

The salvage vehicle sales industry is highly
competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully.

We face
significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and for the buyers
of those vehicles. We believe our principal competitors include other vehicle
remarketing companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from
insurance companies and other suppliers, and large vehicle dismantlers, who may
buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies, bypassing the salvage
sales process. Many of the insurance companies have established relationships
with competitive remarketing companies and large


dismantlers. Certain of our competitors may have greater financial
resources than us. Due to the limited number of vehicle suppliers, particularly
in the UK, the absence of long-term contractual commitments between us and our
suppliers and the increasingly competitive market environment, there can be no
assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense.

We may also encounter significant competition for local, regional and
national supply agreements with vehicle suppliers. There can be no assurance
that the existence of other local, regional or national contracts entered into
by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or
our expansion plans. Furthermore, we are likely to face competition from major
competitors in the acquisition of salvage vehicle remarketing facilities, which
could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby
materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations. These potential new competitors may include
consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses, organized salvage vehicle
buying groups, automobile manufacturers, automobile auctioneers and software
companies. While most vehicle suppliers have abandoned or reduced efforts to
sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us,
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue, which could adversely
affect our market share, results of operations and financial condition.
Additionally, existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have
greater financial and marketing resources than us; therefore, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.

Because the
growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and
development of new salvage vehicle facilities, the rate of growth of our
business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete
acquisitions and develop new facilities.

We seek to increase our sales and
profitability through the acquisition of other salvage vehicle facilities and
the development of new salvage vehicle facilities. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to:

·

continue to acquire
additional facilities on favorable terms;

·

expand existing facilities
in no-growth regulatory environments;

·

increase revenues and
profitability at acquired and new facilities;

·

maintain the historical
revenue and earnings growth rates we have been able to obtain through facility
openings and strategic acquisitions; or

·

create
new salvage vehicle storage facilities that meet our current revenue and
profitability requirements.


As we continue to expand our operations, our failure to manage growth
could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.

Our ability to manage growth is not only
dependent on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities, but also on
our ability to:

·

hire, train and manage
additional qualified personnel;

·

establish new relationships
or expand existing relationships with vehicle suppliers;

·

identify and acquire or
lease suitable premises on competitive terms;

·

secure adequate capital;
and

·

maintain the supply of
vehicles from vehicle suppliers.

Our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively
could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.

Our annual and quarterly performance may
fluctuate, causing the price of our stock to decline.

Our revenues and operating results have
fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the
future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors, many
of which are beyond our control. Factors that may affect our operating results
include, but are not limited to, the following:

·

fluctuations in the market
value of salvage and used vehicles;

·

as a result of our
recently acquired companies in the UK, the impact of foreign exchange gain and
loss;

·

our ability to
successfully integrate our newly acquired operations in the UK and any
additional international markets we may enter;

·

the availability of
salvage vehicles;

·

variations in vehicle
accident rates;

·

buyer participation in the
Internet bidding process;

·

delays or changes in state
title processing;

·

changes in international,
state or federal laws or regulations affecting salvage vehicles;

·

changes in local laws
affecting who may purchase salvage vehicles;

·

our ability to integrate
and manage our acquisitions successfully;

·

the timing and size of our
new facility openings;

·

the announcement of new
vehicle supply agreements by us or our competitors;

·

severity of weather and
seasonality of weather patterns;


·

the amount and timing of
operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and
expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;

·

the availability and cost
of general business insurance;

·

labor costs and collective
bargaining;

·

availability of subhaulers
at competitive rates;

·

acceptance of buyers and
sellers of our Internet-based model deploying VB


, a proprietary Internet auction-style
sales technology, including in the UK market where we still sell salvage
vehicles using live auctions;

·

changes in the current
levels of out of state and foreign demand for salvage vehicles;

·

the introduction of a
similar Internet product by a competitor; and

·

the ability to obtain
necessary permits to operate salvage storage facilities.

Due to the foregoing factors, our operating results in one or more
future periods can be expected to fluctuate. As a result, we believe that
period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily
meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future
performance. In the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance
being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the price
of our common stock could decline substantially.

Our strategic shift to an Internet-based
sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property
assets to our business, and any inability to protect those rights could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of
operations.

Implementation of VB


across our North American salvage operations
has increased the relative importance of intellectual property rights to our
business. Our intellectual property rights include pending patent applications
for VB


as
well as trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property
rights. We are in the process of prosecuting an initial patent application
relating to VB


and
cannot predict whether a patent will actually issue from that application. Even
if a patent is issued, the scope of the protection gained may be insufficient
or any issued patent could subsequently be deemed invalid or unenforceable. In
addition, we are increasingly entering into agreements with third parties
regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property in foreign
jurisdictions. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available
in every country in which our products and services are distributed, deployed,
or made available. We seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as
trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by third parties, or
intentionally or accidentally by our employees, which would cause us to lose
the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets. Any significant
impairment of our intellectual property rights, or any inability to protect our
intellectual property rights, could have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


We have in the past been and may in the
future be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to
defend, could require us to pay damages, and could limit our ability to use
certain technologies in the future.

Litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of
intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on
intellectual property rights. Our reliance on intellectual property rights has
increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our VB


auction-style
sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions in
our North American operations. As we face increasing competition, the
possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. Litigation
and any other intellectual property claims, whether with or without merit, can
be time-consuming, expensive to litigate and settle, and can divert management
resources and attention from our core business. An adverse determination in
current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and
services in the manner currently conducted. We may also have to pay damages or
seek a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable
terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses, if it is
available for us to license at all. We could also be required to develop
alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort
and expense.

New accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing
standards could require us to make changes or adjustments in our accounting
policies and procedures that could adversely affect our financial statements.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, or other
accounting organizations or governmental entities issue new pronouncements or
new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to
change our accounting policies and procedures. To date, we do not believe any
new pronouncements or interpretations have had an adverse effect on our
financial condition or results of operations, but future pronouncements or
interpretations could require us to change our policies or procedures.
Moreover, we continually review our critical accounting policies in light of
the accounting literature and changes in our operations.

Government regulation of the salvage vehicle
sales industry may impair our operations, increase our costs of doing business
and create potential liability.

Participants in the salvage vehicle sales industry are subject to, and
may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of
governmental, regulatory and administrative rules, regulations, land use
ordinances, licensure requirements and procedures, including those governing
vehicle registration, the environment, zoning and land use. Failure to comply
with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing
regulations may result in impairment of our operations and the imposition of
penalties and other liabilities. At various times, we may be involved in
disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development and/or
operation of our business facilities. We believe that we are in compliance in
all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements. We may be
subject to similar types


of regulations by federal, national,
international, provincial, state, and local governmental agencies in new
markets. In addition, new regulatory requirements or changes in existing
requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities, may
limit our base of salvage vehicle buyers and may decrease demand for our
vehicles.

The operation of our storage facilities poses
certain environmental risks, which could adversely affect our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Our operations are subject to federal, state,

national

, provincial and local laws and regulations regarding
the protection of the environment in the countries which we have storage
facilities. In the salvage vehicle remarketing industry, large numbers of
wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities and, during that time, spills
of fuel, motor oil and other fluids may occur, resulting in soil, surface water
or groundwater contamination. In addition, certain of our facilities generate
and/or store petroleum products and other hazardous materials, including waste
solvents and used oil. In the UK, we provide vehicle de-pollution and crushing
services for End-of-Life program vehicles. We could incur substantial
expenditures for preventative, investigative or remedial action and could be
exposed to liability arising from our operations, contamination by previous
users of certain of our acquired facilities, or the disposal of our waste at
off-site locations. Environmental laws and regulations could become more
stringent over time and there can be no assurance that we or our operations
will not be subject to significant costs in the future. Although we have
obtained indemnification for pre-existing environmental liabilities from many
of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities, there can be
no assurance that such indemnifications will be adequate. Any such expenditures
or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.

If we experience problems with our providers
of fleet operations, our business could be harmed.

We rely solely upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver
vehicles to and from our North American storage facilities. Our failure to
pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our
reputation and brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business. Further, an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices
charged by our independent subhaulers, which may significantly increase our
cost. We may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers.

If we experience problems with our UK
trucking fleet operations, our business could be harmed.

We use a fleet of company owned trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles
to and from our UK storage facilities. We are subject to the risks associated
with providing trucking services, including inclement weather, disruptions in
transportation infrastructure, availability and price of fuel, any of which
could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net
income.


We are partially self-insured for certain losses.

We are partially self-insured for certain losses related to medical
insurance, general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability. Our liability
represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the
balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is
established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates.
While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information
currently available, if actual trends, including the severity of claims and
medical cost inflation, differ from our estimates, our results of operations
could be impacted. Further, we rely on independent actuaries to assist us in
establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated
with these self-insured exposures.

Our executive officers, directors and their
affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ
from other shareholders.

Our executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially
own, in the aggregate, approximately 20% of our common stock as of July 31,
2007. If they were to act together, these shareholders would have significant
influence over most matters requiring approval by shareholders, including the
election of directors, any amendments to our articles of incorporation and
certain significant corporate transactions, including potential merger or
acquisition transactions. In addition, without the consent of these
shareholders, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions
that could be beneficial to us or our other investors. These shareholders may
take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors.

We have a shareholder rights plan, or poison
pill, which could affect the price of our common stock and make it more
difficult for a potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our
securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest, or to acquire us.

In March 2003, our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights
plan, commonly known as a poison pill. The poison pill may discourage, delay,
or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities,
initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, or acquiring us through an
acquisition, merger, or similar transaction. Such an acquirer could be
prevented from consummating one of these transactions even if our shareholders
might receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices.

If we lose key management or are unable to
attract and retain the talent required for our business, we may not be able to
successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives.

Our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance
of our executive management team, all of whom are employed on an at-will basis
and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete. If we lose the
service of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, in
particular Willis J. Johnson, our Chief Executive Officer, and A. Jayson Adair,
our President, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or
otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able to
successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives.

Item 2.

Properties

Our corporate headquarters are located in Fairfield, California. This
facility consists of approximately 100,000 square feet of office space owned by
Copart. We also own or lease an additional 131 operating facilities. In the US,
we have facilities in every state except Delaware, New Hampshire, North Dakota,
Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming. In Canada we are only in the
province of Ontario. In the UK, as of July 31, 2007, we owned or leased 7
operating facilities. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to
meet current requirements and that suitable additional or substitute space will
be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations and
additional offices.


Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved
in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of business,
such as actions related to injuries, property damage, and handling or disposal
of vehicles. This litigation includes the following matters:

On September 16,
2005, Richard M. Gray filed suit against Copart of Connecticut, Inc. and
A. Safrin, in the State Court of the County of Chatham, State of Georgia,
alleging a class action for unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by
us, and related claims. Relief sought includes class certification, damages,
fees, costs and expenses. Our motion for summary judgment was heard on January 31,
2007 and was denied. We believe the claim is without merit, and are defending
the lawsuit vigorously.

On July 28,
2006, Foreign Car Sales and Service LLC (“FCS”) filed suit against Copart in
the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana,
originally alleging antitrust violations and unfair trade practices. Relief
sought originally included class certification based on both unfair trade
practices and Sherman Act violations, damages, fees, costs and expenses. On January 5,
2007, the Magistrate required FCS to amend its complaint. A First Amended
Complaint was rejected, and a Second Amended Complaint was submitted February 16,
2007, in which FCS abandoned its unfair trade practices claims, and now relies
simply on breach of contract claims. FCS continues to seek certification
of a class based upon violations of the Sherman Act. Plaintiff is

pro se

and is demanding a total award of 51% of our issued
stock, as well as $97,000 in damages arising form damages to vehicles. We filed
a motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, improper
venue, and failure to state a claim. We believe the claims are without merit,
and are defending the lawsuit vigorously.

On August 7,
2006, Kimberly and Jason Green filed suit against Copart in the Superior Court
of the State of California, County of Sacramento, making allegations pursuant
to a California consumer protection statute similar to a class action for
unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by us, and related claims.
Relief sought included class certification, damages, fees, costs and expenses.
We filed an answer on September 1, 2006 denying the claim. On July 2,
2007, the parties entered into a settlement agreement terminating the lawsuit.

We accrue for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable
and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these
matters on our future results of operations cannot be predicted because any
such effect depends on future results of operations, the amount and timing of
the resolution of such matters. We believe that any ultimate liability will not
have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. However, the amount of the liabilities associated with these claims, if
any, cannot be determined with certainty.

Dividend
Policies

We have not
paid a cash dividend since becoming a public company in 1994. We currently
intend to retain any earnings for use in our business.

We expect to continue to use cash flows from operations to finance our
working capital needs and to develop and grow our business. In addition to our
stock repurchase, we are considering a variety of alternative potential uses
for our remaining cash balances and our cash flow from operations. These alternative
potential uses include additional stock repurchases, the payment of dividends
and acquisitions.

Stock Repurchase

In February 2003,
our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 9.0 million shares of
our common stock. The repurchases may be effected through solicited or
unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions. No time limit has been placed on the duration of the share
repurchase program. The repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts
as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time. For the year ended July 31,
2007, we repurchased 2,995,405 shares at a weighted average price of $29.91.
For the year ended July 31, 2006, we repurchased 366,000 shares at a
weighted average price of $24.24. For the year ended July 31, 2005, we did
not repurchase any shares. The total


number of shares repurchased under the program as of July 31, 2007
is 7,033,705 million, leaving 1,966,295 million available under the repurchase
program.

purchased in each fiscal year are set forth in the table below:

Overview

We provide
vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance companies, with a full range of
remarketing services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the Internet
through our Virtual Bidding Second Generation, or VB


, Internet auction-style sales
technology. In the United Kingdom, or UK, we sell salvage vehicles through a
combination of live auctions and Internet bidding. We sell principally to
licensed vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle
dealers and exporters. Salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total
loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered
stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has
already been made. We offer vehicle suppliers a full range of remarketing
services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and
minimize administrative and processing costs. In the United States, or US, we
sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid
by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services
such as towing and storage. In the United Kingdom, we operate primarily on a
principal basis,


purchasing the salvage vehicle outright from the insurance companies
and reselling the vehicle for our own account to buyers through a combination
of live auctions and Internet sales.

Our revenues
consist of salvage fees charged to vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers,
transportation revenue and purchased vehicle revenues. Consignment revenues
from suppliers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis
where we collect a fixed amount for selling the vehicles regardless of the
selling price of the vehicle or, under our Percentage Incentive Program, or PIP
program, our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the
vehicle sales price. Under the fixed fee program, we generally charge an
additional fee for title processing and special preparation. Although sometimes
included in the consignment fee, we may also charge additional fees for the
cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility, storage of the vehicle, and
other incidental costs. Under the consignment programs, only the fees
associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue, not the actual
sales price (gross proceeds). Salvage fees also include fees charged to vehicle
buyers for purchasing vehicles, storage and annual registration. Transportation
revenue includes charges to suppliers for towing vehicles under certain
contracts. Transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to
buyers for delivering vehicles. Purchased vehicle revenue, includes the gross
sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered
to own and primarily generated in the UK.

Operating costs
consist primarily of operating personnel (which includes yard management,
clerical and yard employees), rent, contract vehicle towing, insurance, fuel,
equipment maintenance and repair, and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase
contracts. Because we operate as a principal in the UK, purchasing and
reselling salvaged vehicles for our own account, we expect operating costs to
increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods. Costs associated with
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management,
accounting, data processing, sales personnel, human resources, professional
fees, research and development and marketing expenses.

During fiscal
2004, we converted all of our North American vehicle remarketing facilities to
an Internet-based auction-style model using our VB


Internet sales technology. This process
employs a two-step bidding process. The first step, called the preliminary bid,
allows buyers to submit bids up to one hour before a real time virtual action
begins. The second step allows buyers to bid against each other, and the high
bidder from the preliminary bidding process, in a real-time process over the
Internet.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we adopted a formal plan to
discontinue the operations of our public auction business Motors Auction Group,
or MAG, and dispose of or convert the related assets. The MAG yards converted
into salvage facilities will continue to be included in the results of
continuing operations on the income statements.


Acquisitions
and New Operations

We have
experienced significant growth as we have acquired sixteen vehicle storage
facilities and established fourteen new facilities since the beginning of
fiscal 2005. All of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting.

As part of our
overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle
suppliers, we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions, as
well as the regions currently served by our facilities. As part of this
strategy, in fiscal 2007 we acquired seven new facilities in the UK located in
Sandy; Sandtoft, Sandwich, Westbury, Chester, Denny; and Wootton and in North
America we opened new facilities in Baltimore, Maryland, Woodburn, Oregon and
Punta Gorda, Florida. In fiscal 2006 we acquired new facilities in or near
Greenwood, Nebraska; Grand Island, Nebraska; York Haven, Pennsylvania;
Chambersburg, Pennsylvania; Altoona, Pennsylvania; Fruitland, Maryland;
Billings, Montana and opened new facilities in or near Honolulu, Hawaii;
Lansing, Michigan; Dover, Florida and Jacksonville, Florida. In fiscal 2005 we
acquired new facilities in or near Lexington, Kentucky and Columbia, Missouri
and opened new facilities in Strongsville, Ohio; Ocala, Florida; Knoxville,
Tennessee; Loganville, Georgia; Spokane, Washington; Tallahassee, Florida and
Hialeah, Florida. We believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen
our coverage as we have 131 facilities located in North America and the United
Kingdom and are able to provide national coverage for our suppliers.

On June 14,
2007, we acquired all the issued share capital of Universal Salvage plc, or
Universal, for £2.00 per share (approximately $3.94 based on currency exchange
rates on June 14, 2007). Universal, based in the UK and operating
exclusively within the UK, is a service provider to the motor insurance and
automotive industries. The aggregate acquisition consideration paid by us
totaled approximately £60.7 million (approximately $120.0 million based on
currency exchange rates on June 14, 2007) and was funded from our
available cash resources. We also assumed outstanding indebtedness of Universal
totaling approximately £2.3 million ($4.5 million as of June 14, 2007).
The acquisition marks our first acquisition outside North America and includes
the seven facilities discussed above.

The
period-to-period comparability of our operating results and financial condition
is substantially affected by business acquisitions, new openings, weather and
product introductions during such periods. In particular, the UK acquisition,
because of its size and, also, because the UK operates primarily on the
principal model versus the agency model employed in the United States, will
have a significant impact on the comparability of revenues and gross margin
percentages in future periods.

In addition to growth through acquisitions, we seek to increase
revenues and profitability by, among other things, (i) acquiring and
developing new salvage vehicle storage facilities in key markets, (ii) pursuing
national and regional vehicle supply agreements, (iii) expanding our
service offerings to suppliers and buyers, and (iv) expanding the
application of VB


into new markets. In addition, we implement
our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost
efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational
procedures, integrating our management information systems and redeploying
personnel, when necessary.


Results of Operations

The following table sets forth for the periods indicated below, certain
information derived from our consolidated statements of income presented in
absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. There can be no assurance
that any trend in operating results will continue in the future.

Revenues from
continuing operations were approximately $560,680 million during fiscal 2007,
an increase of approximately $32.1 million, or 6% over fiscal 2006. Revenue
growth from same store sales in North America, those opened before August 1,
2006, was approximately $15.1 million. Revenue growth from new facilities,
those opened after August 1, 2006, including facilities in or near
Baltimore, Maryland; Woodburn, Oregon; and Punta Gorda, Florida was
approximately $2.2 million. Of the increase in revenues in fiscal 2007 as
compared to fiscal 2006, $14.8 million was attributable to revenues generated
in the UK from June 14, 2007, the date of acquisition.

Yard Operation
Expenses.

Yard operation expenses from
continuing operations were approximately $293.9 million during fiscal 2007, a
decrease of approximately $4.1 million, or 1.4%, over fiscal 2006. Included in
yard expenses is depreciation expense of $30.7 million, an increase of $3.8
million over fiscal 2006. Yard operation expenses decreased to 52.4% of
revenues during fiscal 2007, as compared to 56.4% of revenues during fiscal
2006. The decreases in yard expenses, excluding depreciation, were primarily
attributable to the decrease in incremental abnormal costs incurred as a result
of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita during fiscal 2006. These additional
inventory-type costs were approximately $14.1 million during fiscal 2006 as
compared to $0.5 million during the fiscal 2007, and were charged to yard
operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 151. These costs include the additional subhauling, payroll,
equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions
created by the hurricanes. These costs do not include normal expenses
associated with the increased unit volume created by the hurricanes, which are
deferred until the sale of the units and are recognized as vehicle pooling
costs on the balance sheet. As of July 31, 2007, all of the incremental
salvage vehicles received as a result of the hurricanes Katrina and Rita have


been sold. In addition, yard operation expenses include costs
attributable to the UK of $10.4 million. The UK operates primarily on a
principal basis and, accordingly has a lower gross margin percentage.

General and Administrative.

General
and administrative expenses from continuing operations were approximately $63.6
million for fiscal 2007, an increase of approximately $4.7 million, or 7.9%,
over fiscal 2006. Included in general and administrative expenses is
depreciation of $5.7 million an increase of $1.2 million over fiscal 2006. Also
included are $2.2 million in general and administrative costs, other than
depreciation attributable to the UK operations. Finally the remaining increase
was due to increased payroll costs, professional services, and general
corporate expansion. These increases were offset by decreased operating lease
costs on computer equipment leases, which were bought out during the year and a
reduction in legal costs. General and administrative expenses increased
slightly to 11.3% of revenues during fiscal 2007, as compared to 11.2% of
revenues during fiscal 2006. Of the increase in general and administrative
expense, $3.0 million was attributable to general and administrative expenses
incurred in the UK. General and administrative expenses in the UK include
amortization expense relating to the Universal acquisition.

Other Income.

Total other income was approximately
$14.3 million during fiscal 2007, an increase of approximately $11.3 million
from fiscal 2006. The increase is due primarily to a $5.5 million increase in
interest income due to higher interest rates and a higher average cash and
investments balance and a decrease of $4.6 million in losses from an equity
investment in Lanelogic Corporation (“Lanelogic”). Other income, which consists
primarily of rental income and gain on the sales of assets, increased
approximately $1.2 million.


Income Taxes.

Our
effective income tax rates for fiscal 2007 and 2006 were approximately 37.3%
and 35.4%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily
the result of fiscal 2006 including a non-recurring $1.8 million out-of-period
reduction, to deferred tax liabilities and income tax expense originating
primarily in 2001 and prior years.

Discontinued Operations.

Discontinued operations declined $15.7 million from
fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006 as we discontinued our MAG operations and disposed
of or converted all the related assets during fiscal 2006. There were no such
disposals in fiscal 2007.

Net Income.

Due to the foregoing factors, we realized net income of
approximately $136.3 million for fiscal 2007, compared to net income of
approximately $96.9 million for fiscal 2006.

Fiscal
2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005

Revenues.

Revenues from continuing operations
were approximately $528.6 million during fiscal 2006, an increase of
approximately $80.8 million, or 18.1%, over fiscal 2005. The increase was due
primarily to increased vehicle unit volume driven by the additional salvage
vehicles associated with hurricanes Katrina and Rita, growth in vehicles
processed at existing yards and vehicles processed from new yards opened or
acquired in fiscal 2006. Existing facilities contributed approximately $71.3
million of the revenue growth and new facilities in or near Honolulu, Hawaii;
Greenwood, Nebraska; Grand Island, Nebraska; York Haven, Pennsylvania;
Chambersburg, Pennsylvania; Altoona, Pennsylvania; Fruitland, Maryland;
Lansing, Michigan and Billings, Montana contributed approximately $9.5 million
of new revenue growth.

Yard Operation Expenses.

Yard operation expenses from
continuing operations were approximately $298.0 million during fiscal 2006, an
increase of approximately $52.4 million, or 21.3%, over fiscal 2005. Included
in yard expenses is depreciation expense of $26.9 million, an increase of $0.3
million over fiscal 2005. Yard operation expenses increased to 56.4% of
revenues during fiscal 2006, as compared to 54.9% of revenues during fiscal
2005. The increases in yard expenses were primarily attributable to the cost of
handling increased volume, a general increase in subhauling costs and the
incremental abnormal costs incurred as a result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
These additional inventory-type costs were approximately $14.1 million in
fiscal 2006 and were charged to yard operations in accordance with SFAS 151.
These costs include the additional subhauling, payroll, equipment and facilities
expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the
hurricanes. These costs do not include normal expenses associated with the
increased unit volume created by the hurricanes, which are deferred until the
sale of the units and are recognized as vehicle pooling costs on the balance
sheet. At the end of fiscal 2006, approximately 28% of the incremental salvage
vehicles received as a result of the hurricanes remained unsold and in
inventory and were subsequently disposed of in fiscal 2007. The processing of
the hurricane vehicles has had and may continue to have a negative impact
on gross and operating margin percentages.

General and Administrative.

General and administrative expenses from continuing
operations were approximately $59.0 million during fiscal 2006, an increase of
approximately $13.4 million, or 29.3%, over


fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to increases in
telecommunication costs, information technology payroll costs, costs relating
to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, SFAS 123(R) stock compensation costs and
outside legal expense associated with a patent litigation matter that was
settled during fiscal 2006 and other pending litigation and general corporate
expansion. General and administrative expenses increased to 11.2% of revenues
during fiscal 2006, as compared to 10.2% of revenues during fiscal 2005. The
increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues
reflects in part changes in the nature of our business. In particular, the
introduction of VB


resulted in a
reduction in certain yard operation expenses relating to conducting live
auctions but increased our general and administrative expenses as we continued
to make technology infrastructure investments and hire additional personnel to
enhance and maintain VB


and other products for use in our auctions.

Other income.

Total
other income was approximately $3.0 million during fiscal 2006, a decrease of
approximately $5.2 million, from fiscal 2005. The decrease was due primarily to
a $6.8 million loss recognized from an equity investment in an unconsolidated
privately-held entity. This loss was offset by an increase in interest income
of approximately $3.3 million due to higher interest rates and a higher average
cash and investments balance. Other income, which consists primarily of rental
income and gain on the sales of non-fleet assets, decreased approximately $1.7
million, resulting from losses on disposals of fixed assets.

Income Taxes.

Our effective combined federal,
state and local income tax rates for fiscal 2006 and 2005 was approximately
35.4% and 38.1%, respectively. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily
the result of recording a non-recurring $1.8 million out-of-period reduction to
deferred tax liabilities and income tax expense originating primarily in 2001
and adjustments to our state tax reserves based on the favorable outcome of an
audit.

Discontinued Operations.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we adopted
a formal plan to discontinue the operations of our public auction business
Motors Auction Group, MAG, and dispose of or convert the related assets. The
MAG yards to be converted into salvage facilities will continue to be included
in the results of continuing operations on the income statements.

Under
SFAS No 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” goodwill is subject
to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value-based
test or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present. The
discontinuation of an operating segment is one of those indicators.
Accordingly, goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 142 as of the second quarter of 2006. We used
a combination of valuation techniques, which included consideration of
market-based approaches and an income approach, in determining the fair value
of our applicable reporting unit in the interim impairment test of goodwill.

In fiscal 2006,
the impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the MAG goodwill
exceeded its implied fair value. The corresponding write-down of goodwill of
$21.8 million to its fair value was reported as a component of discontinued
operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. We also
determined that the value of the remaining MAG covenants not to compete were
impaired and recorded an


impairment expense in the amount of $0.5 million. This write-down
of covenants not to compete is also reported as a component of discontinued
operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

During the
second quarter of fiscal 2006, we sold the business and related assets of one
of the MAG locations for approximately $0.1 million. During the third quarter
of fiscal 2006, we sold the business and related assets including the real
estate of one of the MAG locations. We received a $12 million promissory note
from the buyer as purchase consideration. The promissory note bears interest at
7% per annum. Interest only payments on the note are due monthly until maturity
on May 28, 2011, at which time the balance of the note is due in full. The
note receivable is collateralized by the real estate and is personally
guaranteed by the buyer. The consideration was allocated to the real estate,
based on an appraisal, and to the business in proportion to their estimated
fair values. The portion of the consideration allocated to the real estate sale
totaled $7.1 million. We deferred a gain on the sale of the real estate of
approximately $2.5 million that will be recognized upon payment of the
principal balance of the note receivable. The remaining consideration of $4.9
million is allocated to the sale of the business. We recognized a gain on the
sale of the business of approximately $3.0 million, which is included in the
results of the discontinued operations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2006, we sold the business and related assets excluding the real estate of
another MAG location. We received a $1.2 million promissory note and $0.2
million in cash from the buyer as purchase consideration. We recognized a gain
on the sale of the business of approximately $1.3 million which is included in
the results of discontinued operations. As of July 31, 2006, no MAG
locations remained. Three of the original six MAG locations were sold and three
were converted into salvage facilities.

Net Income.

Due to the foregoing factors, we realized net income of
approximately $96.9 million for fiscal 2006, compared to net income of
approximately $102.1 million for fiscal 2005.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically,
we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations, public
offerings of common stock, the equity issued in conjunction with certain
acquisitions and debt financing. Cash and cash equivalents, combined with
short-term investments decreased by approximately $74.3 million from July 31,
2006 to July 31, 2007, primarily as a result of cash used for the
acquisition of Universal, purchases of property and equipment and repurchases
of common stock which was offset by cash generated from continuing operations.
During the winter months, most of our facilities process 10% to 30% more
vehicles than at other times of the year. This increased seasonal volume
requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs
of the additional business. Our primary source of cash generated by operations
is from the collection of sellers’ fees, buyers’ fees and reimbursable advances
from the proceeds of sold vehicles.

As of July 31,
2007, we had working capital of approximately $247.9 million, including cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $201.0 million.
During the course of the year, we invest substantially all of our cash balances
in AAA rated auction rate securities. Auction rate securities are principally
variable rate securities tied to short-term interest rates with maturities on
the face of the securities in excess of 90 days. Auction rate securities have
interest rate resets through a modified Dutch auction, at


predetermined short-term intervals, usually every 7, 28 or 35 days.
They trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the
option of the issuer. Interest paid during a given period is based upon the
interest rate determined during the prior auction. Although these instruments
are issued and rated as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as
short-term securities because of the liquidity provided through the interest
rate reset.

We believe that our currently available cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to
satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12
months. However, if we experience significant growth in the future, we
may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt
or additional equity.

Operating
Activities

Net cash
provided by operating activities increased by approximately $40.1 million to
$182.1 million during fiscal 2007 when compared to fiscal 2006, due to the
increase in net income which was offset in part to the timing of routine
changes in working capital items. The increase in net income is primarily the
result of increased revenue in fiscal 2007 and the loss on discontinued
operations in the amount of $17.9 million in fiscal 2006, which did not recur
in fiscal 2007.

Net cash provided
by operating activities increased by approximately $6.0 million to $141.9
million during fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006 we
consumed cash through the growth in accounts receivable and vehicle pooling
costs and we generated cash through the growth in deferred revenue. The
movements in these accounts are driven primarily by the significant growth in
vehicles held for sale which was impacted by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The
decrease in net income is primarily a result of the loss on discontinued
operations in the amount of $17.9 million, which was offset in part by
increased revenue.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately
$20.9 million to $136.0 million during fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal
2004, primarily due to the increase in net income, which was offset in part to
the timing of routine changes in working capital items.

Investing
Activities

During the
fiscal years ended July 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we purchased
approximately $921.8 million, $717.1 million and $755.4 million, respectively
of short-term investments, which were offset by the sale of $967.9 million,
$568.4 million, $928.0 million, respectively of short-term investments. We
typically invest our cash in auction rate notes with ratings of AAA.

Capital
expenditures related to continuing operations (excluding those associated with
property and equipment attributable to acquisitions) were approximately $76.8
million, $97.0 million and $66.2 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to opening and
improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment.


During the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2007, we used approximately $120.0 million in
cash for the acquisition of Universal which includes the following seven
locations in the UK: Sandy, Sandtoft, Sandwich, Westbury, Chester, Denny, and
Wootton. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2006, we used cash for the
acquisition of facilities in or near Billings, Montana; Fruitland, Maryland;
Altoona, Pennsylvania; Chambersburg, Pennsylvania; York Haven, Pennsylvania;
Greenwood, Nebraska and Grand Island, Nebraska, which had an aggregate cash
cost of approximately $23.0 million. During the fiscal year ended July 31,
2005, we used cash for the acquisition of operations in Lexington, Kentucky and
Columbia, Missouri, which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately $4.5
million.

During the year
ended July 31, 2006, we invested approximately $9.0 million for a 50%
equity interest in Lanelogic, a Delaware limited liability corporation (“Lanelogic”).
We have no further contractual funding commitment. Based on our evaluation of
Lanelogic and the related agreements, management believes that Lanelogic does
not constitute a Variable Interest Entity as defined in FIN No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

.
As a result, our investment has been accounted for under the equity method
prescribed by APB No. 18,

The Equity
Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

.

During the
second quarter of fiscal 2007, our Chairman and CEO, made a personal unsecured
loan to Lanelogic to prevent a restriction of working capital from disrupting
its business as Lanelogic sought additional equity financing. The loan was
repaid during the second quarter ended January 31, 2007. We have concluded
that the personal unsecured loan did not cause a change in the accounting of
Lanelogic as an equity method investment. During the second quarter ended January 31,
2007, Lanelogic received a strategic equity investment totaling approximately
$10 million from two new investment groups as well as Lanelogic’s founder. We
did not participate in this additional equity financing into Lanelogic. In
addition, Lanelogic converted from a limited liability company to a Delaware
Corporation, of which we are now a stockholder.

On August 15, 2007, subsequent to the end of our fiscal year, our
Chairman and CEO provided a personal guaranty in favor of Dealer Services
Corporation as a condition for providing a credit facility to Lanelogic, Inc.
a Corporation in which we have a less than controlling interest. The guaranty
was approved by our Audit Committee. We have concluded that the personal
guaranty does not cause a change in the accounting of Lanelogic as an equity
method investment.

Financing
Activities

In fiscal 2007,
2006 and 2005, we generated approximately $10.9 million, $5.4 million and $1.8
million, respectively, through the exercise of stock options.

In fiscal 2007,
2006 and 2005, we generated approximately $1.5 million, $1.6 million and $1.4
million, respectively, through the issuance of shares under the employee stock
purchase program.

In February 2003, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase
up to 9.0 million shares of our common stock. The repurchases may be
effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions. No time limit has been placed on the
duration of the share


repurchase program. The repurchases will be
made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be
discontinued at any time. For the year ended July 31, 2007, we repurchased
2,995,405 shares at a weighted average price of $29.91. For the year ended July 31,
2006, we repurchased 366,000 shares at a weighted average price of $24.24. No
shares were repurchased in fiscal 2005. We accounted for the repurchase of our
common stock in the years ended July 31, 2007 and 2006 by reducing common
stock by $89.6 million and $8.9 million, respectively. During the period from February 2003
through July 31, 2007, we repurchased a total of 7,033,705 shares at a
weighted average price of $18.41.

Commercial
commitments include primarily letters of credit provided for insurance programs
and certain business transactions.


Credit
Facilities

On February 23,
2001, we entered into a credit facility with our existing banking syndicate.
The facility provided by Wells Fargo Bank, Fleet National Bank and U.S. Bank
National Association consists of an unsecured revolving reducing line of credit
in the amount of approximately $10.6 million. On May 8, 2006, the line of
credit was reduced to zero and the line of credit was terminated in accordance
with its terms.

On November 13, 2006, Universal Salvage, our wholly owned
subsidiary purchased on June 14, 2007, entered into three credit
facilities with National Westminster Bank Plc. The first facility provides
approximately $8.0 million in overdraft protection and working capital. The
second and third facilities of approximately $6.0 and $10.0 million,
respectively, provide liquidity for acquisitions and investments. Each of these
facilities carries an interest rate of the bank’s index, which was 5.75% at July 31,
2007, plus .75% and is collateralize by real property. At July 31, 2007
there were no amounts borrowed under these facilities.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of July 31, 2007, we did not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements (as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K).

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation
of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On
an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to vehicle
pooling costs, allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, income taxes,
long-lived assets and self insured liabilities. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.

Management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies
and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit
Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies
and estimates in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our significant
accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial
statements for fiscal 2007. The following is a summary of the more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements:

Revenue Recognition

We provide a
portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and
delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer. These services include the ability
to use our Internet sales technology and vehicle delivery, loading, title
processing, preparation and storage. We evaluate multiple-element arrangements
relative to our buyer and seller agreements in accordance with Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 00-21,

Revenue


Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

(“EITF 00-21”), which addresses accounting for multiple-element
arrangements, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(“SAB 104”), which
addresses revenue recognition for units of accounting.

The services we
provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller’s
behalf and under most of our current North American contracts, collecting the
proceeds from the buyer. We are not entitled to any such seller fees until we
have collected the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller and,
accordingly, we recognize revenue for seller services after service delivery
and cash collection.

Vehicle sales,
where we purchase and remarket vehicles on our own behalf are recognized in
accordance with SAB 104 on the sale date, which is typically the point of high
bid acceptance. Upon high bid acceptance, a legal binding contract is formed
with the buyer, and we record the gross sales price as revenue.

In certain
cases, seller fees are not contingent upon collection of the seller proceeds
from the buyer. However, we determined that we are not able to separate the
services into separate units of accounting because we do not have fair value
for undelivered items. As a result, we do not recognize seller fees until the
final seller service has been delivered, which generally occurs upon collection
of the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller.

We provide a
number of services to the buyer of the vehicle, charging a separate fee for
each service. Each of these services has been assessed under the criteria of
EITF 00-21 to determine whether we have met the requirements to
separate them into units of accounting within a multi-element arrangement. We
have concluded that the sale and the post-sale services are separate units of
accounting. The fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the
sale, and the fees for the post-sale services are recognized upon successful
completion of those services using the residual method.

We also charge buyers an annual registration fee for the right to
participate in our vehicle sales program, which is recognized ratably over the
term of the arrangement, and relist and late-payment fees, which are recognized
upon receipt of payment by the buyer. No provision for returns has been
established, as all sales are final with no right of return, although we
provide for bad debt expense in the case of non-performance by our buyers and
sellers.

Vehicle Pooling Costs

We defer in
vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles
consigned to and received by us, but not sold as of the balance sheet date. We
quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of
vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period, the number
of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation
expenses of the period. The primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain
facility costs, labor, transportation, and vehicle processing. If our
allocation factors change, then yard operation expenses could increase or
decrease correspondingly in the future. These costs are expensed as vehicles
are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis.


We apply the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”), No. 151,

Inventory Costs

(“SFAS 151”) to our vehicle pooling costs. SFAS 151 requires that items
such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight and
rehandling costs be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether
they meet the criteria of “so abnormal” as provided in Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4,

Inventory
Pricing

. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that the allocation of
fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal
capacity of production facilities.

Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for
estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to suppliers or buyers and
the inability of our suppliers or buyers to make required payments. If billing
disputes exceed expectations and/or if the financial condition of our suppliers
or buyers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required.

Valuation of
Goodwill

We evaluate the impairment of goodwill of our salvage sales operating
segment, annually (or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present) by
comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value. Future
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating
segment could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the
investment, thereby requiring impairment charges in the future.

Income Taxes
and Deferred Tax Assets

We are required to estimate income tax provisions and amounts
ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions. Such estimates
involve significant interpretations of regulations and are inherently very
complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may
not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year.

We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing
basis. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require the assessment of
our performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a
valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets. Our ability to
realize deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company’s ability to generate
future taxable income. Accordingly, we have established a valuation allowance
when, in certain taxable jurisdictions, the utilization of the tax asset is
uncertain. Additional timing differences, future earning trends and/or tax
strategies may occur which could warrant a need for establishing an additional
valuation allowance or a reserve.

Long-lived
Asset Valuation, including Intangible Assets

We evaluate long-lived assets, including property and equipment and
certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by a comparing the carrying
amount of an asset to the


estimated undiscounted future cash flows
expected to be generated by the use of the asset. If the estimated undiscounted
cash flows change in the future, we may be required to reduce the carrying
amount of an asset.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees
using the fair value method as required by SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

. SFAS No. 123(R) requires
that the compensation cost related to share-based payment transactions,
measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued,
be recognized in the financial statements. Determining the fair value of
options using the Black-Scholes model, or other currently accepted option
valuation models, requires highly subjective assumptions, including future
stock price volatility and expected time until exercise, which greatly affect
the calculated fair value on the grant date. If actual results are not
consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key
assumptions, we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax
expense, which could have a material impact on financial position and results
of operations.

Retained Insurance Liabilities

We are partially self-insured for certain losses related to medical,
general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability. Our liability
represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the
balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is
established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates.
While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information
currently available, if actual trends, including the severity of claims and
medical cost inflation, differ from our estimates, our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows could be impacted.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

For a description of the new accounting standards that affect us, refer
to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk

Our principal
exposures to financial market risk are interest rate and foreign currency risk.
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to
our investment portfolio of marketable securities. As of July 31, 2007, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts,
which bear interest at a variable rate and AAA rated auction rate securities,
which also bear interest at a variable rate. Due to the average maturity and
nature of the Company’s investment portfolio, we believe a sudden change in
interest rates would not have a material effect on the value

of our

investment portfolio. As the
interest rates on a material portion of our cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments are variable, a change in interest rates earned on our
investment portfolio would impact interest

income along with cash flows, but would not
materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments.


Our exposure to foreign currency risks relates to our operations in
Canada and the UK. We do not hedge our exposure to the Canadian Dollar or the
British Pound. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
or trading purposes.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

We conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, or “Disclosure Controls,” as of the end of the period
covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. This evaluation, or “Controls
Evaluation” was performed under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and
Director (our “CEO”) and our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
(our “CFO”). Disclosure Controls are controls and procedures designed to
provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this annual report on Form 10-K,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the U.S. SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our CEO and CFO, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Disclosure Controls
include some, but not all, components of our internal control over financial
reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting was also separately
evaluated as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K
in connection with Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting which is set forth below.

Based upon the
Controls Evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the
period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, our Disclosure
Controls were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, and that such information is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the
SEC.


Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Our management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial
reporting (as such item is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f)) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Management
assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31,
2007, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). We have excluded
one acquisition, Universal Salvage, or Universal, which we made in June 2007
from the scope of management’s evaluation, as the late timing of this
acquisition made it impracticable to conduct a meaningful evaluation of the
acquired business’ internal control over financial reporting before the end of
the fiscal year. Universal constituted $162.0 million and $124.7 million of
total and net assets, respectively, as of July 31, 2007 and $14.8 million
and $1.0 million of revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then
ended. Notwithstanding the exclusion of Universal from our assessment, there
was no material change to our internal control over financial reporting due to
the acquisition pursuant to Rule 15d-15 of the Exchange Act. Our
assessment on internal control over financial reporting for fiscal year 2008
will include Universal. Management’s assessment included evaluation of such
elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting
controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control
environment. This assessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed
by our Finance department.

Based on our
assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of management’s
assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Our independent
registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, independently
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of July 31, 2007. Ernst & Young LLP has issued an attestation
report which appears on the following page of this annual report on Form 10-K.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of
Directors and Shareholders of Copart, Inc.

We have audited
Copart, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31,
2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). Copart, Inc.’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting”. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in
the accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting”, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls
of Universal Salvage, which is included in the July 31, 2007 consolidated
financial statements of Copart, Inc. and constituted $162.0 million and
$124.7 million of total and net assets, respectively, as of July 31, 2007
and $14.8 million and $1.0 million of revenues and net income, respectively,


for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting of Copart, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the
internal control over financial reporting of Universal Salvage.

In our opinion,
Copart, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2007 based on the COSO
criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance
sheets of Copart, Inc. as of July 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended July 31,
2007 of Copart, Inc. and our report dated September 25, 2007
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our
disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will
prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
any, within Copart, Inc. have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any
system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or
deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or
procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control
system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of
the Exchange Act), during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control
over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of
Directors and Shareholders of Copart, Inc.

We have audited
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Copart, Inc. as of July 31,
2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’
equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the two years in
the period ended July 31, 2007. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,
the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Copart, Inc. at July 31,
2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2007, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective August 1, 2005,
the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Copart, Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated September 25,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

July 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of
Presentation and Description of Business

Copart, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of
California in 1982. The consolidated financial statements of Copart, Inc.
(the “Company”) include the accounts of the parent company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, including its foreign wholly owned subsidiaries Copart Canada, Inc.
(“Copart Canada”) and Copart, UK (“Copart UK”). Significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Copart Canada
was incorporated in January 2003 and Copart UK was incorporated in June 2007.
Copart UK’s period end is July 28, 2007, which is the Saturday nearest July 31,
2007. Investments in companies in which the Company exercises significant
influence, but the Company does not control (generally 20% to 50% ownership
interest), are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company
provides vehicle suppliers, primarily insurance companies, with a full range of
services to process and sell salvage vehicles primarily over the Internet
through the Company’s Virtual Bidding Second Generation (“VB


”) Internet auction-style sales
technology. The Company sells principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers,
rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle dealers and exporters. Salvage
vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss for insurance or
business purposes or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance
settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made. The Company offers
vehicle remarketing services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle
sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs.

Use of
Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, vehicle pooling
costs, self-insured reserves, allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes,
revenue recognition, share-based compensation, long-lived asset impairment
calculations and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Foreign
Currency Translation

The Canadian
Dollar and the British Pound are the functional currencies of the Company’s
subsidiaries, Copart Canada, Inc. and Copart UK, respectively, as they are
the primary currencies within the economic environment in which each subsidiary
operates. Assets and liabilities of the respective subsidiary’s operations are
translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, and revenues and
expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates in effect
during each reporting period.

Policies

(Continued)

Adjustments resulting from the translation of each subsidiary’s
financial statements are reported in other comprehensive income.

Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

The amounts recorded for financial instruments in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements, which include cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities approximate their fair values as of July 31, 2007 and 2006 due
to the short-term nature of those instruments.

Revenue
Recognition

The Company
provides a portfolio of services to its sellers and buyers that facilitate the
sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer. These vehicle remarketing
services include the ability to use its Internet sales technology and vehicle
delivery, loading, title processing, preparation and storage. The Company
evaluates multiple-element arrangements relative to the Company’s buyer and
seller agreements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

(EITF 00-21), which addresses accounting for multiple-element
arrangements, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104

Revenue Recognition

(SAB104), which
addresses revenue recognition for units of accounting.

The vehicle
remarketing services the Company provides to the seller of a vehicle involve
disposing of a vehicle on the seller’s behalf and under most of the Company’s
current North American contracts, collecting the proceeds from the buyer. The
Company is not entitled to any seller fees until the Company has collected the
sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller and, accordingly, the Company
recognizes revenue for seller services after service delivery and cash
collection.

In certain
cases, seller fees are not contingent upon collection of the seller proceeds
from the buyer. However, the Company determined that it is not able to separate
the services into separate units of accounting because the Company does not
have fair value for undelivered items. As a result, the Company does not
recognize seller fees until the final seller service has been delivered, which
occurs upon collection of the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller.

Vehicle sales,
where the Company purchases and remarkets vehicles on its own behalf are
recognized in accordance with SAB 104 on the sale date, which is typically the
point of high bid acceptance. Upon high bid acceptance, a legal binding
contract is formed with the buyer, and the Company records the gross sales
price as revenue.


COPART, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

July 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies (Continued)

The Company
provides a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle, charging a separate
fee for each service. Each of these services has been assessed under the
criteria of EITF 00-21 to determine whether the Company has met the
requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multi-element
arrangement. The Company has concluded that the sale service and the post-sale
services are separate units of accounting. The fees for the auction service are
recognized upon completion of the sale, and the fees for the post-sale services
are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the residual
method.

The Company
also charges buyers an annual registration fee for the right to participate in
its vehicle sales program, which is recognized ratably over the term of the
arrangement, and relist and late-payment fees, which are recognized upon
receipt of payment by the buyer. No provision for returns has been established,
as all sales are final with no right of return, although the Company provides
for bad debt expense in the case of non-performance by its sellers.

Historically, the Company recorded revenue for most seller and buyer
fees upon completion of a sale. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the
Company recorded a correction of an error to account for its services in
accordance with the policy above; the effect of which was to reduce revenue,
net income and diluted earnings per share by $4.4 million,
$1.5 million and $0.01, respectively for the fourth quarter and fiscal
year ended July 31, 2005.

Yard Operations

Yard operations consist primarily of operating personnel (which
includes yard management, clerical and yard employees), rent, contract vehicle
towing, insurance, fuel and equipment maintenance and repair.

General and
Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive,
accounting and data processing, sales personnel, professional services, system
maintenance and enhancements and marketing expenses.

Advertising

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in
general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Advertising expenses were $0.7 million, $1.8 million and $2.8 million in fiscal
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Policies (Continued)

Other income

Other income consists primarily of interest income, gain and losses
from the disposal of fixed assets, rental income and losses in an
unconsolidated equity investment.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.

Net Income Per
Share

Basic net income per share amounts were computed by dividing
consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share amounts were
computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding plus dilutive potential common shares calculated for
stock options outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.

Cash, Cash
Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

The Company
considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of
three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and
cash equivalents include cash held in checking and money market accounts. Short-term
investments consist primarily of AAA rated auction rate securities with readily
determinable fair market values and with original maturities in excess of three
months. Auction rate securities are principally variable rate securities tied
to short-term interest rates. Auction rate securities have interest rate resets
through a modified Dutch auction, at predetermined short-term intervals,
usually every 7, 28 or 35 days. They trade at par and are callable at par on
any interest payment date at the option of the issuer. Interest paid during a
given period is based upon the interest rate determined during the prior
auction. Although these instruments are issued and rated as long-term
securities, they are priced and traded as short-term securities because of the
liquidity provided through the interest rate reset.


COPART, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

July 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies (Continued)

Restricted
investments consist of AAA rated enhanced cash funds with next day liquidity. Enhanced
cash funds typically invest in commercial paper, floating rate notes and fixed
rate bonds which have an original maturity in excess of three months. Although
the funds may invest in securities with maturities in excess of three months,
they are priced and traded as short-term securities as they have next day
liquidity.

The Company has classified its entire investment portfolio as
available-for-sale. The Company views its available-for-sale securities as
available for use in its current operations, excluding $9.1 million of enhanced
cash funds that were placed in escrow as part of the agreement to acquire
Century Salvage plc (refer to Note 22), which are classified as restricted.
These restricted investments are recorded as a non-current asset as of July 31,
2007. The Company has classified auction rate securities as short-term, even
though the stated maturity may be one year or more beyond the current balance
sheet date. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of Shareholders’ Equity and
Comprehensive Income. Unrealized losses are charged against income when a
decline in the fair market value of an individual security is determined to be
other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on investments are included in
interest income.

Inventory

Inventories of purchased vehicles are stated at the lower of cost or
estimated realizable value. Cost includes our cost of acquiring ownership of
the vehicle. The cost of vehicles sold are charged to yard operations as sold.

Vehicle Pooling
Costs

The Company
defers in vehicle pooling costs certain yard and fleet expenses associated with
vehicles consigned to and received by the Company but not sold as of the
balance sheet date. The Company quantifies the deferred costs using a
calculation that includes the number of vehicles at its facilities at the
beginning and end of the period, the number of vehicles sold during the period
and an allocation of certain yard operation costs of the period. The primary
expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs, labor,
transportation, and vehicle processing. If the allocation factors change, then
yard and fleet expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the
future. These costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods
on an average cost basis.

July 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The operating
results for the year ended July 31, 2006 were adversely affected by
incremental costs, characterized as “abnormal” in SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs

, incurred as a result of
hurricanes Katrina and Rita. These additional inventory-type costs,
characterized as “abnormal” and charged to yard operations costs, are
approximately $0.5 million and $14.1 million for the years ended July 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively. These costs include the additional subhauling,
payroll, equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating
conditions created by the hurricanes.

These costs do not include normal expenses associated with the
increased unit volume created by the hurricanes, which are deferred until the
sale of the units and are recognized as vehicle pooling costs on the balance
sheet. As of July 31, 2007, all of the incremental salvage vehicles
received as a result of the hurricanes had been sold.

Accounts
Receivable

Accounts receivable, which consist primarily of advance charges due
from insurance companies and the gross sales price of the vehicle due from
buyers, are recorded when billed, advanced or accrued and represent claims
against third parties that will be settled in cash.

Concentration
of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments, which subject the Company to potential credit risk, consist of its
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. The
Company adheres to its investment policy when placing investments. The
investment policy has established guidelines to limit the Company’s exposure to
credit expense by placing investments with high credit quality financial
institutions, diversifying its investment portfolio, limiting investments in
any one issuer or pooled fund and placing investments with maturities that
maintain safety and liquidity. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents
with high credit quality financial institutions. Deposits with these financial
institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided; however, these
deposits typically are redeemable upon demand and, therefore, the Company
believes that the financial risks associated with these financial instruments
are minimal.

The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, and generally does not
require collateral on its accounts receivable. The Company estimates its
allowances for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends, the age
of outstanding receivables and existing economic conditions. If events or
changes in circumstances indicate that specific receivable balances may be
impaired, further consideration is given to the collectibility of those
balances and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. Past-due account balances
are written off when the Company’s internal collection efforts have been
unsuccessful in collecting the

amount due. The Company does not have off-balance sheet credit exposure
related to its customers and to date, the Company has not experienced
significant credit related losses.

In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, State Farm Insurance accounted for 11%,
14% and 12%, respectively of the Company’s revenues. At July 31, 2007 and
2006, State Farm Insurance accounted for 11% and 12% of accounts receivable,
respectively. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our
revenues for any period presented and at July 31, 2007 and 2006, no other
single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s trade receivables.

Property
and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the
respective improvements, which is between 5 and 10 years. Significant
improvements, which substantially extend the useful lives of assets are
capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. Depreciation and amortization is computed on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of: 3 to 7 years for transportation and other
equipment; 3 to 10 years for office furniture and equipment; and 15 to 40 years
or the lease term, whichever is shorter, for buildings and improvements.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates long-lived assets, including property and
equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Standard (“SFAS”) No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets

, a long-lived asset is initially measured at the
lower of its carrying amount or fair value. An impairment loss is recognized
when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from
the use of the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset. The
impairment loss is then calculated by comparing the carrying amount with its
fair value, which is usually estimated using discounted cash flows expected to
be generated from the use of the asset.

Goodwill
and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets

, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
potential impairment, at a minimum on an annual basis, or when indications of
potential impairment exist. The Company performed its annual impairment test
for goodwill during the fourth quarter utilizing a market value approach. The
impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization
is also

performed annually or when impairment
indications exist, and consists of a comparison of the fair value of the
intangible asset with its carrying amount. Identifiable intangible assets that
are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process
similar to that used to evaluate other long-lived assets.

Retained
Insurance Liabilities

The Company is partially self-insured for certain losses related to
medical, general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability. The
Company’s liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims
incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not
discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and
actuarial estimates. While the Company believes these estimates are reasonable
based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the
severity of claims and medical cost inflation, differ from the Company’s
estimates, the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows could be impacted.

Share-Based
Compensation

Effective August 1,
2005, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

, (“SFAS No. 123(R)”),
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated
fair value. Prior to August 1, 2005, the Company accounted for these
share-based payments using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
Accounting Principals Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

,
and related Interpretations (“APB No. 25”), as permitted by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

and
SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure

, which provided
that compensation expense had only been recognized when the fair market of the
Company’s stock options granted to employees and directors was greater than the
exercise price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

The Company
adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified-prospective transition
method and therefore prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and
do not include, the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). Under this transition
method, share-based compensation cost recognized in the fiscal years ended July 31,
2007 and 2006 includes share-based compensation expense for all share-based
payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of August 1, 2005,
based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of SFAS No. 123

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation

, and share-based compensation expense
for all share-based payment awards granted subsequent to August 1, 2005,
based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to


COPART, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

July 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies (Continued)

estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of
grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that
is ultimately expected to vest is recognized in expense over the requisite
service periods. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates. In the Company’s pro forma information
required under SFAS No. 123 for the periods prior to fiscal 2006, the Company
accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. For options issued subsequent to August 1,
2005, the Company recognizes compensation expense for stock option awards on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. For options
issued prior to August 1, 2005, the Company recognizes compensation
expense for stock option awards on a graded vesting basis over the requisite
service period of the award.

The following table illustrates the effect on
net income after tax and net income per common share as if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to
share-based compensation using market-based option valuation models during the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2005 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including
the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect
their fair value estimate, it is the Company’s opinion that the existing models
do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the
employee stock options. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated
fair value of options is amortized to expense over the vesting period of equity
awards (generally five years), using the graded vesting method.

The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model utilizing the following assumptions:

awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on historical
experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of
the share-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee
behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its share-based awards.

Estimated
volatility factor—The Company uses the trading history and implied volatility
of its common stock in determining an estimated volatility factor when using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula to determine the fair value of options
granted.

Expected
dividend—The Company has not declared dividends. Therefore, the Company uses a
zero value for the expected dividend value factor when using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing formula to determine the fair value of options granted.

Risk-free
interest rate—The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the
Black-Scholes option-pricing formula on the implied yield currently available
on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with the same or substantially equivalent
remaining term.

Estimated
forfeitures—When estimating forfeitures, the Company considers voluntary and
involuntary termination behavior as well as analysis of actual option forfeitures.

Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were approximately
$10.9 million, $5.4 million and $1.8 million for the years ended July 31,
2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The Company realized an income tax benefit
of approximately $3.8 million, $2.3 million, and $1.1 million from stock option
exercises during the years ended July 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), the Company presents excess tax benefits
from disqualifying dispositions of the exercise of incentive stock options,
vested prior to August 1, 2005, if any, as financing cash flows rather
than operating cash flows.

Reclassifications

Certain previous year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.

Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

In July 2006,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48
(“FIN 48”),

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

,
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48
prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure,
present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that
the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return (including a decision
whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction). Under
FIN 48, the financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences
of such positions presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the
position and all relevant facts, but without considering time values. The
Company will assess all material open positions in all tax jurisdictions as of
the adoption date and determine the appropriate amount of tax benefits that are
recognizable under FIN 48. Any difference between the amounts previously
recognized and the benefit determined under the new guidance, including changes
in accrued interest and penalties will be recorded on the date of adoption. The
Company adopted FIN 48 on August 1, 2007

and is currently assessing the impact the adoption of FIN 48 will have
on its consolidated results of operations and financial position.

In September 2006,
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued SAB 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

(“SAB 108”)
to provide guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year
misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a
materiality assessment. Under SAB 108, companies should evaluate a
misstatement based on its impact on the current year income statement, as well
as the cumulative effect of correcting such misstatements that existed in prior
years existing in the current year’s ending balance sheet. The Company adopted
SAB 108 in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2007 and it did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and
financial position.

In September 2006,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157,

Fair
Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact
on its consolidated results of operations and financial position.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including
an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing
standards, which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value.
Under SFAS 159, a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and
loans receivable, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, equity
method investments, accounts payable, guarantees and issued debt. Other
eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that
otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non-cash warranty
obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the
warranty goods or services. If the use of fair value is elected, any upfront
costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be
deferred, e.g., debt issue costs. The fair value election is irrevocable and
generally made on an instrument-by-instrument basis, even if a company has similar
instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value. At the adoption
date, unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has
been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained
earnings. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 159, changes in fair value are
recognized in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007 and is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of
fiscal 2009. The Company is currently determining whether fair value accounting
is appropriate for any of its eligible items and cannot estimate the impact, if
any, which SFAS 159 will have on its consolidated results of operations and
financial position.

(2) Acquisitions

Fiscal 2007 Transactions

In June 2007,
the Company completed the acquisition of Universal Salvage plc (“Universal”)
(the “Acquisition”). Universal, based in the UK, operates seven salvage yards
in the UK and is a leading service provider to the motor insurance and automotive
industries. Universal specializes in the disposal of accident-damaged,
End-of-Life and fee-based non-salvage vehicles. This Acquisition was completed
because of its strategic fit with the North American business. The Acquisition
has been accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

, which has
resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements. This goodwill arises because the purchase price for Universal
reflects a number of factors including its future earnings and cash flow
potential; the multiple to earnings, cash flow and other factors at which
similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers, the competitive
nature of the process by which the Company acquired the business; and because
of the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies it brings to
existing operations.

In accordance
with SFAS No. 141, Universals’ net assets acquired and liabilities assumed
have been recorded at their fair value. The aggregate purchase price of £60.7
million ($120.0 million based on currency exchange rates on June 14, 2007)
was funded from the Company’s available cash resources. In addition, the
Company assumed liabilities of £18.7 million ($36.9 million), which included
outstanding indebtedness of Universal totaling approximately £2.3 million ($4.5
million).

The Company has

intangible assets include finite lived supply contracts, tradenames,software,
licenses and databases, which are being amortized over their estimated useful
lives, ranging from one to ten years. Goodwill of $47.9 million recognized in
the Acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The Company
has arranged to obtain additional information regarding certain asset
valuations. The Company believes the potential changes to its preliminary
purchase price allocation will not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations and financial position.

The Company has
included the operating results of Universal in its consolidated financial

Fiscal 2006
Transactions

During fiscal 2006, the Company made the following three acquisitions:
Auto Auction Associates of Montana, Inc., Heartland Insurance Pool, Inc.
and Central Penn Sales, LLC. These three companies consisted of seven separate
facilities. The consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of $23.0
million in cash. The acquired net assets consisted of accounts and advances
receivable, vehicle pooling costs, fixed assets, land, buildings, goodwill, and
covenants not to compete. The acquisitions were accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting, and the operating results subsequent to the
acquisition dates are included in the Company’s consolidated statements of
income. These new facilities contributed $6.9 million of revenues during fiscal
2006. The excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net
identifiable assets acquired of $19.0 million has been recorded as goodwill.
The Company estimates the entire goodwill balance relating to these
acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes. In addition, the Company paid
$1.3 million for covenants

not to compete relating to these
acquisitions, which are being amortized over five to seven years. In
conjunction with the Central Penn Sales acquisition, the Company entered into
leases for the use of these facilities at fair value.

Fiscal 2005 Transactions

During fiscal
2005, the Company made the following two acquisitions: Kentucky Auto Salvage
Pool, Inc. (“KASP”) of Lexington, Kentucky and Insurance Auctions of
Missouri, Inc. of Columbia, Missouri. The consideration paid for these
acquisitions consisted of $4.5 million in cash. The acquired net assets
consisted of accounts and advances receivable, vehicle pooling costs, fixed
assets, land, buildings, goodwill, and covenants not to compete. The
acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and
the operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates are included in the
Company’s consolidated statements of income. These new facilities contributed
$0.7 million of revenues during fiscal 2005. The excess of the purchase price
over the fair market value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $3.7
million has been recorded as goodwill. The Company estimates the entire
goodwill balance relating to these acquisitions will be deductible for tax
purposes. In addition, the Company paid $0.3 million for covenants not to
compete relating to these acquisitions, which are being amortized over five to
seven years. In conjunction with the Lexington, Kentucky and Columbia,
Missouri, acquisitions, the Company entered into leases for the use of these
facilities at fair value.

Pro forma financial information for the fiscal 2006 and 2005
acquisitions does not result in a significant change from actual results.

(3) Discontinued Operations and Goodwill Impairment

During fiscal
2006, the Company adopted a formal plan to discontinue the operations of Motors
Auction Group (“MAG”) and dispose of or convert the related assets. The MAG
yards to be converted into salvage facilities will continue to be included in
the results of continuing operations on the income statements.

Under
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is
subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair
value-based test or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present. The
discontinuation of an operating segment is one of those indicators.
Accordingly, goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 142 during the second quarter of 2006. The
Company used a combination of valuation techniques, which included
consideration of market-based approaches and an income approach, in determining
the fair value of the Company’s applicable reporting unit in the interim
impairment test of goodwill.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(3) Discontinued Operations and Goodwill
Impairment

(Continued)

The impairment
test indicated that the carrying value of the MAG goodwill exceeded its implied
fair value. The corresponding write-down of goodwill of $21.8 million to its
fair value was reported as a component of discontinued operations in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company also determined
that the value of the remaining MAG covenants not to compete was impaired and
recorded an impairment charge in the amount of $0.5 million. This write-down of
covenants not to compete is also reported as a component of discontinued
operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

During the
second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company sold the business and related assets
of one of the MAG locations for approximately $0.1 million. During the third
quarter, the Company sold the business and related assets including the real
estate of one of the MAG locations. The Company received a $12 million
promissory note from the buyer as purchase consideration. The promissory note
is reflected in land purchase options and other assets at its net present value
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at July 31, 2007 and 2006.
The promissory note bears interest at 7% per annum. Interest only payments on
the note are due monthly until maturity on May 28, 2011, at which time the
balance of the note is due in full. The note receivable is collateralized by
the real estate and is personally guaranteed by the buyer. The buyer is in
compliance with the terms of the promissory note and the Company believes the
note amount is fully recoverable. The consideration was allocated to the real
estate, based on an appraisal, and to the business in proportion to their
estimated fair values. The portion of the consideration allocated to the real
estate sale totaled $7.1 million. The Company deferred a gain on the sale of
the real estate of approximately $2.5 million that will be recognized upon
payment of the principal balance of the note receivable. The remaining
consideration of $4.9 million is allocated to the sale of the business. The
Company recognized a gain on the sale of the business of approximately $3.0
million, which is included in the results of the discontinued operations.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company sold the remainder of the
business and related assets excluding the real estate of another MAG location.
The Company received a $1.2 million promissory note and $0.2 million in cash
from the buyer as purchase consideration. The buyer is in compliance with the
terms of the promissory note and the Company believes the note amount is fully
recoverable. The promissory note is reflected in land purchase options and
other assets at its net present value in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet at July 31, 2007 and 2006. The Company recognized a gain on the sale
of the business of approximately $1.3 million, which is included in the results
of discontinued operations. As of July 31, 2006, no MAG locations
remained. Three of the original six MAG locations were sold and three were
converted into salvage facilities.

In accordance with the guidance in SFAS No. 142, goodwill is

frequently upon the occurrence of circumstances that indicate that goodwill may
be impaired. The Company’s annual impairment tests were performed in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2007 and 2006. The annual results of these tests indicated
that goodwill was not impaired. The assessment measured the amount by which the
carrying amount of goodwill exceeded the market value of the Company’s sole
reporting unit. Refer to Note 3, for additional discussion related to the
impairment of goodwill from discontinued operations recognized during fiscal
2006. As of July 31, 2007, the aggregate amount of goodwill impairment

(10) Long-Term Debt

On February 23,
2001, the Company entered into a credit facility with its existing banking
syndicate. The facility provided by Wells Fargo Bank, Fleet National Bank and
U.S. Bank National Association consisted of an unsecured revolving reducing
line of credit in the amount of approximately $10.6 million. On May 8,
2006, the line of credit was reduced to zero and the line of credit was
terminated in accordance with its terms.

On November 13, 2006, Universal, our wholly owned subsidiary
purchased on June 14, 2007, entered into three credit facilities with
National Westminster Bank Plc. The first facility provides approximately $8.0
million in overdraft protection and working capital. The second and third
facilities of approximately $6.0 and $10.0 million, respectively, provide
liquidity for acquisitions and investments. Each of these facilities carries an
interest rate of the bank’s index, which was 5.75% at July 31, 2007, plus
..75% and is collateralize by real property. At July 31, 2007, there were
no amounts borrowed under these facilities.

(11) Shareholders’ Equity

General

The Company has authorized the issuance of 180 million shares of common
stock, no par value, of which approximately 88,333,677 shares are issued and
outstanding at July 31, 2007. As of July 31, 2007 and 2006, the
Company has reserved 1,337,337 and 1,515,883 shares of common stock, respectively

Company to repurchase up to 9 million shares of its common stock. The
repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in
the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. No time limit has been
placed on the duration of the share repurchase program. The repurchases will be
made at such times and in such amounts as the Company deems appropriate and may
be discontinued at any time. For the year ended July 31, 2007, the Company


COPART, INC.

(Continued)

repurchased 2,995,405 shares at a weighted
average price of $29.91. For the year ended July 31, 2006, the Company
repurchased 366,000 shares at a weighted average price of $24.24. For the year
ended July 31, 2005, the Company did not repurchase any shares. The total
number of shares repurchased under the program as of July 31, 2007 was
7,033,705, leaving 1,966,295 million available under the repurchase program.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The ESPP provides for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 2.5 million
shares of common stock of the Company by employees pursuant to the terms of the
ESPP. The Company’s ESPP was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by
the shareholders in 1994. The ESPP was amended and restated in 2003 and again
approved by the shareholders. Under the ESPP, employees of the Company who
elect to participate have the right to purchase common stock at a
15 percent discount from the lower of the market value of the common stock
at the beginning or the end of each six month offering period. The ESPP permits
an enrolled employee to make contributions to purchase shares of common stock
by having withheld from their salary an amount up to 10 percent of their
compensation (which amount may be increased from time to time by the Company
but may not exceed 15% of compensation). No employee may purchase more than
$25,000 worth of common stock (calculated at the time the purchase right is
granted) in any calendar year. The Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors administers the ESPP. The number of shares of common stock issued
pursuant to the ESPP during each of fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 66,734,
83,765 and 68,633, respectively. As of July 31, 2007, 1,517,375 shares of
common stock have been issued pursuant to the ESPP and 982,626 shares remain
available for purchase under the ESPP.

Stock Options

In December 2001,
the Company adopted the Copart, Inc. 2001 Stock Option Plan (“Plan”),
presently covering an aggregate of 4.5 million shares of the Company’s common
stock. The Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees
and non-qualified stock options to employees, officers, directors and
consultants at prices not less than 100% and 85% of the fair market value for
incentive and non-qualified stock options, respectively, as determined by the
Board of Directors at the grant date. Incentive and non-qualified stock options
may have terms of up to ten years and vest over periods determined by the Board
of Directors. Options generally vest ratably over a five-year period. The Plan
replaced the Company’s 1992 Stock Option Plan (“1992 Plan”), which expired in August 2002.
At July 31, 2007, 1,337,337 shares were available for future grant under
the Plan.

As required by
SFAS 123(R), the Company made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is
recognizing compensation cost only for those equity awards expected to vest.

The aggregate
intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value
(i.e., the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last
trading day of the year ended July 31, 2007 and the exercise price, times
the number of shares) that would have been received by the option holders had
all option holders exercised their options on July 31, 2007. The aggregate
intrinsic value of options exercised was approximately $12.1 million, $4.9
million and $2.9 million in the fiscal years ended July 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively and represents the difference between the exercise price of
the option and the estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock on the
dates exercised. As of July 31, 2007, the total compensation cost related
to non-vested stock-based awards granted to employees under the Company’s stock
option plans but not yet recognized was $7.1 million, net of estimated
forfeitures. This cost will be amortized on straight-line basis over a weighted
average term of 2.55 years and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in
estimated forfeitures. The fair value of options vested in fiscal 2007, 2006
and 2005 is $4.4 million, $2.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively.

(11) Shareholders’ Equity (Continued)

In general, subject to certain limited exceptions, the Rights become
exercisable when a person or group acquires 15% or more of the Company’s common
stock or a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the Company’s
common stock is announced or commenced. After any such event, the Company’s
other stockholders may purchase an additional $120.48 worth of additional
shares of the Company’s common stock at 50% of the then-current market price.
The Rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts
to acquire us on terms not approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. The
Rights may be redeemed by the Company at $0.001 per Right at any time before
any person or group acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.

The Company’s
ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate
future taxable income. Accordingly, the Company has established a valuation
allowance in taxable jurisdictions where the utilization of the tax assets are
uncertain. Additional timing differences or future tax losses may occur which
could warrant a need for establishing additional valuation allowances against
certain deferred tax assets.

The Company is
under routine income tax audits in two states for tax years between 2001 and
2005. Management believes that adequate amounts have been provided for any
adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations.

In fiscal 2007,
2006 and 2005, the Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $3.8
million, $2.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, upon the exercise of
certain stock options which is reflected in shareholders’ equity.

The valuation
allowance for the years ended July 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately
$1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively, which is a net increase of $0.2
million.

The Company has
a Canadian net operating loss of approximately $1.0 million, most of which
expires between 2011 and 2014. In addition, the Company also has various state
net operating losses of $15.0 million, which expire between 2017 and 2027.

The Company has not provided US federal income and foreign withholding
taxes from undistributed earnings of its foreign operations, including
Universal, because it plans to permanently reinvest the earnings of its foreign
operations as of July 31, 2007. If these earnings were distributed, foreign tax
credits may become available under current law to reduce or eliminate the
resultant US income tax liability.

Leases

The Company
leases certain domestic and foreign facilities and certain equipment under
noncancelable operating leases. In addition to the minimum future lease
commitments presented below, the leases generally require the Company to pay
property taxes, insurance, maintenance and repair costs. Certain leases provide
the Company with either a right of first refusal to acquire or an option to
purchase a facility at fair value. Certain leases also contain escalation
clauses and renewal option clauses calling for increased rents. Where a lease
contains an escalation clause or a concession such as a rent holiday, rent
expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in
accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin 85-3

Accounting for Operating Leases with Scheduled Rent Increases.

Commitments

Letters of Credit

The Company had outstanding letters of credit of $11.8 million at July 31,

Purchase Commitments

The Company has obligations under certain UK seller contracts for the purchase
of vehicles at pre-determined prices, which typically are based upon a

Contingencies

Legal Matters

The Company is
involved in litigation and damage claims arising in the ordinary course of
business, such as actions related to injuries, property damage, and the
handling or disposal of vehicles. Legal fees and other costs associated with
such actions are expensed as incurred and were not material in any period
reported. In addition, the Company assesses, in conjunction with its legal
counsel, the need to record a liability for litigation and contingencies. The
Company reserves for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable
and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes that the
ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material effect on its
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the amount of
future reserves required associated with these claims, if any, cannot be
determined with certainty. This litigation includes the following matters:

On September 16,
2005, Richard M. Gray filed suit against Copart of Connecticut, Inc. and
A. Safrin, in the State Court for the County of Chatham, State of Georgia,
alleging a class action for unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by
the Company, and related claims. Relief sought includes class certification,

damages, fees, costs and expenses. The Company’s motion for summary
judgment was heard on January 31, 2007 and was denied. The Company
believes the claim is without merit, and is defending the lawsuit vigorously.

On July 28,
2006, Foreign Car Sales and Service LLC (“FCS”) filed suit against Copart in
the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana,
originally alleging antitrust violations and unfair trade practices. Relief
sought originally included class certification based on both unfair trade
practices and Sherman Act violations, damages, fees, costs and expenses. On January 5,
2007, the Magistrate required FCS to amend its complaint. A First Amended
Complaint was rejected, and a Second Amended Complaint was submitted February 16,
2007, in which FCS abandoned its unfair trade practices claims, and now relies
simply on breach of contract claims. FCS continues to seek certification
of a class based upon violations of the Sherman Act. Plaintiff is in

pro se

and is demanding a total award
of  51% of Copart’s issued stock, as well
as approximately $97,000 in damages arising from damages to vehicles. The
Company filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction,
improper venue, and failure to state a claim. The Company believes the claims
are without merit, and are defending the lawsuit vigorously.

On August 7,
2006, Kimberly and Jason Green filed suit against Copart in the Superior Court
of the State of California, County of Sacramento, making allegations pursuant
to a California consumer protection statute similar to a class action for
unreasonable amounts claimed for storage liens by the Company, and related claims.
Relief sought includes class certification, damages, fees, costs and expenses. The
Company filed an answer on September 1, 2006 denying the claim. On July 2,
2007, the parties entered into a settlement agreement terminating the lawsuit.

The Company accrues
for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount can
be reasonably estimated. The effect of the outcome of these matters on the
Company’s future results of operations cannot be predicted because any such
effect depends on future results of operations, the amount and timing of the
resolution of such matters. The Company believes that any ultimate liability
will not have a material effect on its financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. However, the amount of the liabilities associated
with these claims, if any, cannot be determined with certainty.

Environmental Matters

In connection
with the acquisition of the Dallas, Texas facility in 1994, the Company set
aside $3.0 million to cover the costs of environmental remediation,
stabilization and related consulting expenses for a six-acre portion of the
facility that contained elevated levels of lead due to the activities of the
former operators. The Company began the stabilization process in 1996 and
completed it in 1999. The Company paid all remediation and related costs from
the $3.0 million fund and, in accordance with the acquisition agreement,
distributed the remainder of the fund to the seller of the Dallas facility,
less $0.2 million which was held back to cover the costs of obtaining the
no-further-action letter. In September 2002, the Company’s environmental
engineering consultant issued a report, which concludes that the soil
stabilization has effectively stabilized the lead-impacted soil, and that the
concrete cap should prevent impact to storm water and subsequent surface water
impact. The Company’s consultant thereafter submitted an Operations and
Maintenance Plan (“Plan”) to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”)
providing for a two-year inspection and maintenance plan for the concrete cap,
and a two-year ground and surface water monitoring plan. In January of
2003, the TCEQ approved the Plan, subject to the additions of upstream
(background) surface water samples from the intermittent stream adjacent to the
facility and documentation of any repairs to the concrete cap during the post
closure-monitoring period. The first semi-annual water sampling was conducted
in April 2003, which reflected that the lead-impacted, stabilized soil is
not impacting the ground and/or surface water. The second round of semi-annual
water samples collected in October and November 2003 reported
concentration of lead in one storm water and one surface water sample in excess
of the established upstream criteria for lead. In correspondence, which the
Company received in July 2004, the TCEQ approved with comment our water
monitoring report dated February 24, 2004. The TCEQ instructed the Company
to continue with post-closure monitoring and maintenance activities and submit
the next report in accordance with the approved schedules. In February 2005,
a report from our environmental engineering consultant was transmitted to the
TCEQ containing the results of annual monitoring activities consisting of two (2) semi-annual
sampling events which occurred in April/June 2004 and October/November 2004.
Laboratory analytical results indicated no lead concentrations exceeding the
target concentration level set in the Corrective Measures Study for the site,
but some results were in excess of Texas surface water quality standards. The
Company’s environmental engineering consultant concluded in the February 2005
report to the TECQ that it is unlikely that lead concentrations detected in the
storm water runoff samples are attributable to the lead impacted soils. Based
on the results of the 2004 samplings, the Company requested that no further
action be taken and that a closure letter be issued by the TCEQ. In September 2007,
the TCEQ notified the Company that they did not concur with our consultant’s
conclusions and recommendations. The TCEQ said it would not provide a closure
letter until additional sampling of surface water is performed which reflects
concentrations of lead below Texas surface

(Continued)

water quality standards. This sampling is anticipated to be performed
in September or October, 2007. The Company is not assured of receiving the
no-further-action letter and may incur further liabilities if the stabilization
process proves ineffective, or if later testing of surface or ground water
reflects concentrations of lead which exceed Texas surface or ground water
quality standards. In addition, in 1994, the Company detected a small quantity
of two hazardous substances in a temporary groundwater monitoring well at the
Dallas facility. The Company’s environmental consultants concluded that both
substances arose from an off-site source and no further action was recommended.

The Company does not believe that any of the above environmental
matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

(16) Guarantees—Indemnifications to Officers and Directors

The Company has entered into indemnification agreements, a form of
which is incorporated by reference in the exhibits of this annual report on Form 10-K,
with the members of our board of directors to indemnify them to the extent
permitted by law against any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, amounts paid
in settlement and damages incurred by the directors as a result of any lawsuit,
or any judicial, administrative or investigative proceeding in which the
directors are sued as a result of their service as members of our board of
directors.

(17) Related Party Transactions

The Company
leases certain of its facilities from officers and/or directors of the Company
under various lease agreements. Rental payments under these leases aggregated
approximately $0.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2007 and
$0.5 million for the years ended July 31, 2006 and 2005, and expire on
various dates through 2012. The Company leases certain of its facilities from
other employees of the Company under various lease agreements. Rental payments
under these leases aggregated approximately $0.3 million, $0.3 million and
$0.4 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

On July 2,
2007, the Company repurchased in a private transaction 1,100,000 shares of its
common stock held jointly by James Grosfeld, one of the Company’s directors,
and his wife, and 73,000 shares of its common stock held by a charitable
foundation established by Mr. and Mrs. Grosfeld. The price paid for
the repurchased shares was $30.77 per share, the closing market price of the
Company’s common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market on July 2,
2007. The repurchase of these shares was pre-approved by the Audit Committee of
our Board of Directors, with Mr. Grosfeld abstaining.

There were no amounts due or from related parties at July 31, 2007
and 2006.

The Company
sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering its eligible
employees. The plan is available to all U.S. employees who meet minimum age and
service requirements and provides employees with tax deferred salary deductions
and alternative investment options. The Company matches 20% of employee
contributions up to 15% of employee salary deferral. The Company recognized an
expense of approximately $0.4 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million for
the fiscal years ended July 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively related
to this plan.

The Company also sponsors an additional defined contribution plan for
most of its UK employees, which is available to all UK employees who meet
minimum service requirements. The Company matches up to 5% of employee
contributions.

(19) Investment in Unconsolidated Entity

During the year
ended July 31, 2006, the Company invested approximately $9.0 million for a
50% equity interest in Lanelogic, a Delaware limited liability corporation (“Lanelogic”).
The Company has no further contractual funding commitment. Based on the Company’s
evaluation of Lanelogic and the related agreements, management believes that
Lanelogic does not constitute a Variable Interest Entity as defined in FIN No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

.
As a result, the Company’s investment has been accounted for under the equity
method prescribed by APB No. 18,

The
Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

.

During the
second quarter ended January 31, 2007, the Company’s Chairman and CEO,
made a personal unsecured loan to Lanelogic to prevent a restriction of working
capital from disrupting its business as Lanelogic sought additional equity
financing. The loan was repaid during the second quarter ended January 31,
2007. The Company has concluded that the personal unsecured loan did not cause
a change in the accounting of Lanelogic as an equity method investment. During
the second quarter ended January 31, 2007, Lanelogic received a strategic
equity investment totaling approximately $10 million from two new investment
groups as well as Lanelogic’s founder. The Company did not participate in this
additional equity financing into Lanelogic. In addition, Lanelogic converted
from a limited liability company to a Delaware Corporation, of which the
Company is now a stockholder.

On August 15,
2007, subsequent to the end of the Company’s fiscal year, the Company’s
Chairman and CEO provided a personal guaranty in favor of Dealer Services
Corporation as a condition for providing a credit facility to Lanelogic, Inc.
a corporation in which Copart has non-controlling interest. The guaranty was
approved by the Company’s Audit Committee. The Company has concluded that the
personal guaranty does not cause a change in the accounting of Lanelogic as an
equity method investment.

(22) Subsequent events

In August 2007,
the Company completed the acquisition of Century Salvage Sales Limited, a
vehicle salvage disposal company with three facilties located in the UK. The
total purchase price was approximately $9.1 million. This brings the total
number of facilities to ten in the UK as of September 27, 2007.

On August 21,
2007, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion pursuant to the terms
of the 2001 Stock Option Plan to accelerate, effective December 31, 2007,
the vesting of all unvested shares of the Company’s common stock subject to
options held by James E. Meeks. It is expected that on December 31, 2007, Mr. Meeks
will hold options to purchase approximately 68,750 unvested shares that will be
subject to this acceleration.

On September 14,
2007 James Grosfeld and Harold Blumenstein, who have served as members of our
board of directors since 1993 and 1994, respectively, resigned as members to
pursue other business and personal interests.

In connection
with their resignations, the board of directors exercised its discretion
pursuant to the terms of the 2001 Stock Option Plan to accelerate the vesting
of all unvested shares of the Company’s common stock subject to options held by
Mr. Grosfeld and Mr. Blumenstein. As of September 6, 2007, Mr. Grosfeld
and Mr. Blumenstein each held options to acquire 86,000 shares of common
stock, of which 30,316 were otherwise unvested. In addition, the board approved
amendments to outstanding option agreements with Mr. Grosfeld and Mr. Blumenstein
to extend the period in which they will be able to exercise their options
following their resignation until the earlier of September 14, 2012 or the
date the option would otherwise have terminated by its terms assuming they had
continued to serve as members of the board of directors.
