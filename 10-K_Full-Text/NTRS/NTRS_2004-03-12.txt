PART I

Item 1—Business

NORTHERN
TRUST CORPORATION

Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation)
was organized as a bank holding company in Delaware in 1971 to hold all of the outstanding capital stock, except directors’ qualifying shares, of The Northern Trust Company (Bank), an Illinois banking corporation headquartered in the Chicago
financial district and the Corporation’s principal subsidiary. The Corporation also owns national bank subsidiaries with offices in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida and Texas, a federal savings bank subsidiary with offices in Connecticut,
Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Washington and Wisconsin, trust companies in New York and Connecticut and various other nonbank subsidiaries, including an investment management company owned through the Bank, a
securities brokerage firm and an institutional investment management company. Effective as of November 20, 2003, the Corporation became a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). The Corporation expects that, although the
operations of other banking and non-banking subsidiaries will continue to be of increasing significance, the Bank will in the foreseeable future continue to be the major source of the Corporation’s assets, revenues and net income. Except where
the context otherwise requires, the term “Northern Trust” refers to Northern Trust Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Northern Trust has not utilized unconsolidated special purpose entities to provide financing,
improve liquidity, transfer assets or manage credit risk.

At
December 31, 2003, Northern Trust had consolidated total assets of approximately $41.5 billion and stockholders’ equity of approximately $3.1 billion. As of September 30, 2003, Northern Trust was the third largest bank holding company in
Illinois and the 30th largest in the United States based on consolidated total assets on that date.

THE NORTHERN TRUST COMPANY

The Bank was founded by Byron L. Smith in 1889 to provide banking and trust services to the public. Throughout its 115 years, the Bank’s growth has come primarily from internal sources rather than through merger
or acquisition. At December 31, 2003, the Bank had consolidated assets of approximately $33.4 billion and common equity capital of approximately $2.1 billion. At September 30, 2003, the Bank was the third largest bank in Illinois and the 35th
largest in the United States, based on consolidated total assets of approximately $33.0 billion on that date.

The Bank currently has 18 banking offices in the Chicago area and the following active wholly-owned subsidiaries. Northern Trust Investments, N.A., a
registered investment adviser (formerly known and conducting business as Northern Trust Investments, Inc.), provides investment management services and products to domestic and international institutional clients. Norlease, Inc. conducts leasing and
leasing-related lending activities. MFC Company, Inc. holds properties that are received from the Bank in connection with certain problem loans. NT Mortgage Holdings LLC, a real estate investment trust, holds a 100% participation in a significant
portion of the Bank’s residential mortgage portfolio, and its parent, NTG Services LLC, conducts market and other studies for the Bank’s global businesses. Nortrust Nominees Limited, located in London, is a United Kingdom (U.K.) trust
corporation organized to hold U. K. real estate and securities for trust and agency accounts. The Northern Trust Company U.K. Pension Plan Limited, located in London, was established in connection with the pension plan for London-based employees.
Northern Trust Holdings Limited is the holding company for Northern Trust Global Services Limited, a U.K. incorporated bank subsidiary established in the fourth quarter 2003 with authority to conduct a broad range of banking and other activities in
the U.K. and, directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries or affiliates, in member states of the European Economic Area. The Northern Trust Company, Canada, located in Toronto, offers institutional trust products and services to Canadian
entities.

Also a subsidiary of the Bank, The Northern Trust
International Banking Corporation, located in New York, is an Edge Act corporation organized for the purpose of conducting international business. Its business is conducted through the following subsidiaries. Northern Trust (Ireland) Limited,
through its three principal subsidiaries, provides trust, custody, fund administration, fund accounting and shareholder registration services to international fund sponsors offering off-shore investment funds. Northern Trust Fund Managers (Ireland)
Limited facilitates the offering of off-shore collective investment products to institutional clients. Northern Trust Global Investments (Europe) Limited, a registered investment adviser, provides investment management services to institutional
clients in the U. K. and continental Europe. The Northern Trust Company of Hong Kong Limited provides securities lending and relationship servicing for large asset custody clients in Asia and the Pacific Rim. Northern Trust Management Services
Limited provides management services to the Bank’s London Branch, Northern Trust Global Services Limited and other Northern Trust entities in the U. K. and continental Europe.



OTHER NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION SUBSIDIARIES

The Corporation’s Florida banking subsidiary, Northern Trust Bank of
Florida N.A., at December 31, 2003 had 26 offices located throughout Florida and consolidated total assets of approximately $5.0 billion. Northern Trust Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2003 had consolidated total assets of approximately $1.2 billion and
served clients from nine office locations in Arizona and one office location in Denver, Colorado. The Corporation’s Texas banking subsidiary, Northern Trust Bank of Texas N.A., had seven

office locations and consolidated total assets of
approximately $950 million at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2003, Northern Trust Bank of California N.A., the Corporation’s California banking subsidiary, had 11 office locations in California and consolidated total assets of approximately
$1.3 billion. The Corporation’s federal savings bank subsidiary, Northern Trust Bank, FSB currently has branch offices in Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Washington and Wisconsin. At December 31,
2003, Northern Trust Bank, FSB had consolidated total assets of approximately $500 million.

The Corporation has a number of nonbank subsidiaries. Northern Trust Securities, Inc. provides full brokerage services to clients of the Bank and the Corporation’s other banking and trust subsidiaries and
selectively underwrites general obligation tax-exempt securities. Northern Trust Global Advisors, Inc., in Stamford, Connecticut, is an institutional investment management company and is the parent of The Northern Trust Company of Connecticut.
Northern Investment Corporation holds certain investments, including a loan made to a developer of a property in which the Bank is the principal tenant. The Northern Trust Company of New York provides security clearance services for all
nondepository eligible securities held by trust, agency, and fiduciary accounts administered by the Corporation’s subsidiaries. Northern Trust Cayman International, Ltd. provides fiduciary services to certain clients residing outside of the
United States. Northern Trust Global Investments Japan, K.K. provides investment management services to clients in Japan.

INTERNAL ORGANIZATION

Northern Trust, under Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President William A. Osborn, organizes client services around its two
client-focused principal business units: Corporate and Institutional Services and Personal Financial Services. Two other business units provide services to the two principal business units: Northern Trust Global Investments, which provides
investment management, and Worldwide Operations and Technology, which provides operating and systems support. The presidents of all four business units as well as the heads of the Financial Management Group and the Risk Management Group report
directly to Mr. Osborn. For financial management reporting purposes, the operations of NTGI and WWOT are allocated to the two principal business units. Financial information regarding the Corporation’s business units is included in the
Corporation’s Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2003.

The following is a brief summary of each business unit’s activities and the activities of the Financial Management Group and the Risk Management Group.

Corporate and Institutional Services (C&IS)

Headed by Frederick H. Waddell, President—Corporate and Institutional
Services, C&IS is a leading worldwide provider of asset management, administration and related services to corporate and public entity retirement funds, foundations and endowments, fund managers, insurance companies and government funds. Asset
management and administration services encompass a full range of state-of-the-art capabilities including: worldwide master trust and master custody, settlement and reporting; cash management; and investment risk and analytical services. Trust and
custody relationships managed by C&IS often include asset management, securities lending, transition management and commission recapture services provided through the Northern Trust Global Investments business unit. At December 31, 2003, total
assets under administration, excluding personal trust assets, were $1.96 trillion, of which $374.3 billion were managed.

C&IS also offers a full range of commercial banking services through the Bank, placing special emphasis on developing and supporting institutional
relationships in two target markets: large domestic corporations and financial institutions (both domestic and international). Institutional relationships include insurance companies and trust services for domestic correspondent banks. Treasury
management services are provided to corporations and financial institutions and include a variety of other products and services to accelerate cash collections, control disbursement outflows and generate information to manage cash positions, as well
as receivables management or lockbox services supplied by RemitStream, the lockbox services entity owned by Fiserv, Inc. and Northern Trust.

In the second quarter of 2003, Northern Trust completed the sale to Hewitt Associates (Hewitt) of substantially all of the assets of Northern Trust
Retirement Consulting, L.L.C. (NTRC). NTRC provided nearly 200 companies and more than 1 million participants with defined benefit, defined contribution and retiree health and welfare administrative services, including recordkeeping and customer
service, and also provided retirement consulting and actuarial services, including plan design and communication. Hewitt and Northern Trust have agreed to work together as preferred providers in each firm’s core area of expertise – Human
Resource outsourcing and consulting services from Hewitt, and trustee, custody and pension payroll services from Northern Trust.



Personal Financial Services (PFS)

Headed by William L. Morrison, President—Personal Financial Services, PFS provides personal trust, custody and
investment management services; individual retirement accounts; guardianship and estate administration; banking (including private banking) and residential real estate mortgage lending. PFS services are delivered through the Bank in Illinois and
also through a network of national bank subsidiaries with offices in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida and Texas, and a federal savings bank subsidiary with offices in Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New York,
Washington and Wisconsin. Northern Trust currently has 82 PFS offices in 15 states. Northern Trust’s first New York office opened in July 2003, and its Stamford, Connecticut office opened in December 2003. PFS is one of the largest bank
managers of personal trust assets in the United States, with $195.0 billion in assets under administration and $104.3 billion in assets under management at December 31, 2003.

PFS focuses on high net worth individuals, executives, retirees and small to mid-size businesses in each banking
subsidiary’s target market. PFS also includes the Wealth Management Group, which provides customized products and services to meet the complex financial needs of families and individuals in the United States and throughout the world with assets
typically exceeding $75 million.

In the second quarter of
2003, Northern Trust acquired Legacy South, an Atlanta-based private wealth management firm that services high net worth individuals, families and private foundations. The purchase price, which is based on the total value of revenues represented by
managed assets transferred, is expected to approximate $13.2 million and will be made in multiple payments over a 16-month period. Through December 31, 2003, Northern Trust has paid $9.5 million of the estimated purchase price. Legacy South was
merged into Northern Trust Bank, FSB. Assets under management at December 31, 2003 associated with this acquisition totaled approximately $472 million. Also in 2003, Northern Trust sold or closed five PFS branch locations that were not aligned with
its strategic focus, recognizing a gain on sale on the Higgins Road location of $17.8 million.

Northern Trust Global Investments (NTGI)

Headed by Terence J. Toth, President—Northern Trust Global Investments, NTGI, through various subsidiaries of the Corporation, provides a broad range of investment management and related services and other
products to domestic and international clients of C&IS and PFS. Clients include institutional and individual separately managed accounts, bank common and collective funds, registered investment companies, non-U.S. collective investment funds and
unregistered private investment funds, including funds of funds. NTGI offers both active and passive equity and fixed income portfolio management, as well as traditional multi-manager products and services. NTGI’s activities also encompass
brokerage, securities lending and related services. NTGI’s international business operates through subsidiaries, joint ventures, alliances and distribution arrangements with entities in Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the U. K.
and the Cayman Islands. As a result of the Corporation’s recent election of financial holding company status under GLBA, NTGI has the ability to offer an increased array of alternative investment products going forward.

In 2003, Northern Trust substantially completed its acquisition of Deutsche
Bank AG’s global passive equity, enhanced equity and passive fixed income investment management businesses. The majority of the accounts were acquired and transitioned in January 2003 and the remainder of the accounts were transitioned over the
next four months. The purchase price totaled $123.8 million, which was primarily based on the value of revenues represented by managed assets transferred. At December 31, 2003, assets under management associated with this acquisition totaled
approximately $75 billion.

Also in 2003, NTGI completed
a change in entity structure of its U.K. unregulated collective investment fund to Irish unit trust and variable capital company funds, regulated by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. This migration enables broader distribution of
NTGI’s multi-manager capabilities throughout Europe. Northern Trust expanded its international presence by opening its first office in Japan. The Tokyo office of Northern Trust Global Investments Japan, K.K. offers fund management to Japanese
public pension, corporate pension and corporate clients. NTGI assets under management from mandates awarded by Japanese clients totaled approximately $13 billion at December 31, 2003.

Worldwide Operations and Technology (WWOT)

Headed by Timothy J. Theriault, President—Worldwide Operations and Technology, WWOT supports all of Northern Trust’s business activities,
including the processing and product management activities of C&IS, PFS and NTGI. These activities are conducted principally in the operations and technology centers in Chicago and London. The Northern Trust Company of New York is also part of
this unit.



Financial Management Group

Headed by Steven L. Fradkin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the Financial Management Group includes
the Treasury, Corporate Controller, Corporate Treasurer, Corporate Development, Investor Relations and Strategic Sourcing functions. The Group is responsible for Northern Trust’s accounting and financial infrastructure and for managing the
Corporation’s financial position.

Risk Management Group

Headed by Perry R. Pero, Vice Chairman and Head of
Corporate Risk Management, the Risk Management Group includes the Credit Policy and Corporate Risk Management functions. The Credit Policy function is described in the section of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2003
referenced on pages 46

–

47. The Corporate Risk Management function monitors, measures and manages non-credit risks across the businesses of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Corporate Risk Management also includes the Economic
Research function.

GOVERNMENT POLICIES

The earnings of Northern Trust are affected by numerous external influences.
Chief among these are general economic conditions, both domestic and international, and actions that the United States and foreign governments and their central banks take in managing their economies. These general conditions affect all of the
Northern Trust’s businesses, as well as the quality, value and profitability of their loan and investment portfolios.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is an important regulator of domestic economic conditions and has the general objective of promoting
orderly economic growth in the United States. Implementation of this objective is accomplished by its open market operations in United States Government securities, its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from Federal
Reserve Banks and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits. The policies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board may strongly influence interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their
savings and time deposits and other purchased funds. Fiscal policies in the United States and abroad also affect the composition and use of Northern Trust’s resources.

COMPETITION

The businesses in which Northern Trust operates are very competitive. Competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial services
organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and global markets in which Northern Trust conducts operations.

Northern Trust’s principal business strategy is to provide quality financial services to targeted markets in which it believes it has a competitive
advantage and favorable growth prospects. As part of this strategy, Northern Trust seeks to deliver a level of service to its clients that distinguishes it from its competitors. In addition, Northern Trust emphasizes the development and growth of
recurring sources of fee-based income and is one of a select group of major bank holding companies in the United States that generates more revenues from fee-based services than from net interest income. Northern Trust seeks to develop and expand
its recurring fee-based revenue by identifying selected markets with good growth characteristics and providing a high level of individualized service to its clients in those markets. Northern Trust also seeks to preserve its asset quality through
established credit review procedures and to maintain a conservative balance sheet. Finally, Northern Trust seeks to operate with a strong management team that includes senior officers having broad experience and long tenure.

Commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit
unions actively compete for deposits, and money market funds and investment banking firms offer deposit-like services. These institutions, as well as consumer and commercial finance companies, national retail chains, factors, insurance companies and
pension trusts, are important competitors for various types of loans. Issuers of commercial paper compete actively for funds and reduce demand for bank loans. For personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling services, trust
companies, investment banking firms, insurance companies, investment counseling firms, and others offer active competition. A wide variety of domestic and foreign companies compete for settlement and other services.



REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

Bank Holding Company Act

The Corporation is subject to the supervision, examination and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA). The BHCA
and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations
of laws and regulations. Under the BHCA, bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking, and bank holding companies may not directly or
indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company, including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Supervision and regulation of
bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries, the deposit insurance funds of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the banking system
as a whole, not for the protection of bank holding company stockholders or creditors.

Subsidiary Regulation

The Bank is a member of
the Federal Reserve System, its deposits are insured by the FDIC, and it is subject to regulation by both these entities, as well as by the Illinois Office of Banks and Real Estate. The Bank is also a member of and subject to the rules of the
Chicago Clearinghouse Association, and is registered as a government securities dealer in accordance with the Government Securities Act of 1986. As a government securities dealer, its activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the
Department of the Treasury. The Bank is registered as a transfer agent with the Federal Reserve and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve in this area. In addition, The Northern Trust Company is subject to
regulation by the Banking Department of the State of New York.

The Corporation’s national bank subsidiaries are members of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC and are subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Northern Trust Bank, FSB is a federal savings
bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision and the FDIC.

The Corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination by the Federal Reserve. In addition, The Northern Trust Company of New York is
subject to regulation by the Banking Department of the State of New York. Northern Trust Securities, Inc. is registered as a broker-dealer with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is a member of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., and, as such, is subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies. Northern Trust Global Advisors, Inc., Northern Trust Investments, N.A., and Northern Trust Bank, FSB are each registered with the SEC under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In addition, Northern Trust Investments, N.A. is subject to regulation by the OCC, and the Bank is registered as a transfer agent with the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), and is subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Northern Trust Company of Connecticut is subject to regulation by the Connecticut Department
of Banking. Two families of mutual funds for which the Bank acts as investment adviser are subject to regulation by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The London Branch of The Northern Trust Company, Northern Trust Global Investments
(Europe) Limited, and Northern Trust Global Advisors, Limited are each subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority in the U.K. Various other subsidiaries and branches conduct business in other states and foreign countries and are
subject to their regulations and restrictions.

Functional Regulation

Enacted in late 1999, the GLBA establishes a system of
federal and state regulation based on functional regulation, meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that
activity. Banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators, insurance by state insurance regulators and securities activities by the SEC and state securities regulators. A significant component of the functional regulation provided in
the GLBA relates to the application of federal securities laws and SEC oversight of some bank securities activities previously exempt from broker-dealer regulation. Among other things, the GLBA amends the definitions of “broker” and
“dealer” under the Exchange Act to remove the blanket exemption for banks. Although the SEC has extended the blanket exemption by order, when the extensions expire, banks will be able to conduct securities activities without broker-dealer
registration only if the activities fall within a set of activity-based exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities. Securities activities outside these
exemptions, as a practical matter, need to be conducted by a registered broker-dealer affiliate. The GLBA also amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that
acts as investment adviser for mutual funds.

The Corporation
has completed an evaluation of its securities activities, particularly the fiduciary aspects of these activities, in light of the amendments to the Exchange Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 discussed above, to determine what, if any,



additional registrations may be required and whether certain activities currently engaged in should instead be conducted
by one of its nonbanking affiliates. The Corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions in light of this evaluation. Additional SEC rulemaking relating to the GLBA’s broker-dealer exemptions discussed above could require
additional evaluation.

On October 30, 2003, the Corporation
filed the necessary declaration with the Federal Reserve Board to become a financial holding company as permitted by GLBA. The declaration was approved and became effective on November 20, 2003. Financial holding companies are permitted to engage in
those activities that the Federal Reserve Board, working with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a
substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. Activities defined to be financial in nature include providing financial or investment advice; securities underwriting and dealing; insurance
underwriting; and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies, subject to significant limitations. They also include activities previously determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or
managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.

Cross-Guarantees Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control, each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred, or expected to be
incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the default of any of the others. Each may also be liable for any assistance the FDIC provides to the other institutions. “Default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the
institution. Thus, any of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the FDIC if the FDIC were to suffer a loss in connection with any of the Corporation’s other banking subsidiaries. This cross-guarantee liability for a
loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities, secured obligations, any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors, other
than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution (with certain exceptions). Although neither the Corporation nor any of its nonbanking subsidiaries may be assessed for such loss under the FDIA, the Corporation has agreed to
indemnify each of its banking subsidiaries, other than the Bank, for any payments a banking subsidiary may be liable to pay to the FDIC pursuant to these provisions of the FDIA.

Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its
banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve Board at times when, absent this Federal Reserve policy, it would not otherwise be provided. The Corporation has source of strength
agreements in place with its existing subsidiaries evidencing its commitment to provide such support as needed. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository institution subsidiaries are subordinate in right of
payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks.

Payment
of Dividends

The Corporation is a legal entity separate
and distinct from its subsidiaries. The principal source of funds for the Corporation is dividends from the Bank. As a result, the Corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the Bank to
pay dividends to the Corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations. Dividend payments from the Bank are subject to Illinois law and to regulatory limitations, generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings,
imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability, financial condition or other cash flow
requirements.

The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy
statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies. The policy statement provides that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available
to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
Accordingly, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health, such as by borrowing.

Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends
the Bank can pay to the Corporation without regulatory approval. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System if the total of all dividends
declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus. In
addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its net profits. State member banks may also be subject to similar restrictions imposed by the laws of the states in which they are chartered.



The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become
undercapitalized. In addition, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The payment of dividends could, depending on the financial condition of
the Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

Capital
Adequacy Requirements

The Federal Reserve Board has
adopted risk-based and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies. The minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet items such as
standby letters of credit) is 8 percent. At least half of the total capital must be composed of common stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings), qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (and, for bank holding companies
only, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock), and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets, among other items
(“tier 1 Capital”). The remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt, other perpetual preferred stock, hybrid capital instruments, mandatory convertible debt securities that meet certain requirements, as well as a limited
amount of reserves for loan losses (“tier 2 Capital”). The Federal Reserve Board has also adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies, requiring tier 1 Capital of at least 3 percent of average quarterly total consolidated
assets.



The federal banking regulators have also established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines that
insured banks and thrifts are required to meet. These regulations are generally similar to those established by the Federal Reserve Board for bank holding companies. The risk-based and leverage capital ratios for the Corporation and its banking
subsidiaries are provided in the following chart.

The federal bank
regulatory agencies’ risk-based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria, assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating. Banking organizations
not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios
when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve Board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum
supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. In addition, the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that concentration of credit risk, interest rate risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities,
as well as an institution’s ability to manage these risks, are important factors to be taken into account by regulatory agencies in assessing an organization’s overall capital adequacy. The agencies have also adopted an adjustment to the
risk-based capital calculations to cover market risk in trading accounts of certain institutions. The risk-based capital regulations also require banking institutions to effectively measure and monitor their interest rate risk and to maintain
adequate capital for that risk.

The bank regulatory
authorities of several nations, individually and through the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Committee), have proposed for comment and are considering changes to the risk-based capital adequacy framework that could affect the capital
guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and banks. In October 2003, the Committee announced its intention to finalize the new Basel Capital Accord (BCA) by no later than mid-year 2004, with implementation of the BCA capital adequacy
framework by year-end 2006. The Corporation is monitoring the status and progress of the proposed rules and has over several years been engaged in preparing to qualify for the approaches to calculating minimum regulatory capital under the BCA that
U.S. regulators have proposed to adopt.

Improvement Act of 1991, the federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized depository institutions. Depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories: “well
capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized,” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital
category within which the institution falls. Under certain circumstances, a well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. A depository
institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions (including paying dividends) or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Adequately capitalized institutions cannot
accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the FDIC, and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew or roll over brokered
deposits.

The banking regulatory agencies are permitted or, in
certain cases, required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories. Depending on the level of an institution’s capital, the agency’s corrective powers include, among
other things:

•

prohibiting the payment of principal and interest on subordinated debt;

•

prohibiting the holding company from making distributions without prior regulatory approval;



•

placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities;

•

placing additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates;

•

restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits;

•

prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; and

•

in the most severe cases, appointing a conservator or receiver for the institution.

A banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan, and such a plan will not be
accepted unless, among other things, the banking institution’s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in
bankruptcy. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and restrictions on certain business activities.
As of December 31, 2003, the Corporation and all of its banking subsidiaries exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized.”

Enforcement Powers of the Federal Banking Agencies

The federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose
substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries, as well as
officers, directors and other institution-affiliated parties of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties. In addition to the grounds discussed under “Prompt Corrective Action,” the
appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the FDIC as conservator or receiver for a banking institution (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist, including, without
limitation, the fact that the banking institution:

•

is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized;

•

fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so;

•

fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan; or

•

materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan.

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders

The Bank is subject to restrictions under federal law, including Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Board, which limit certain transactions with the
Corporation, including loans, other extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases. Such transactions by a banking subsidiary with any one affiliate are limited in amount to 10 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus and, with all
affiliates together, to an aggregate of 20 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus. Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit, as well as certain other transactions, are required to be secured in specified amounts. These and certain
other transactions, including any payment of money to the Corporation, must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be, offered to nonaffiliated companies.

The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and their related interests (collectively
referred to herein as “insiders”) contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O apply to all federally insured institutions and their subsidiaries and holding companies. These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower
and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests. These loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus, and
the FDIC may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions. Regulation O institutions are not subject to the prohibitions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 on certain loans to insiders.



Anti-Terrorism Legislation

On October 26, 2001, the President signed into law the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which contains the International Money
Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001. That act contains anti-money laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions. The act requires U.S. financial
institutions to adopt policies and procedures to combat money laundering and grants the Secretary of the Treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions’ operations. The
Corporation has established policies and procedures to assure compliance with the act and the related regulations.

Deposit Insurance

Under the FDIC’s risk-based insurance assessment system, each insured bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. Each
insured bank is placed in one of nine risk categories based on its level of capital and other relevant information and its insurance assessment rate is then determined by the FDIC. There is currently a 27 basis point spread between the highest and
lowest assessment rates, so that banks classified as strongest by the FDIC are subject in 2004 to no insurance assessment, and banks classified as weakest by the FDIC are subject to an insurance assessment rate of .27%. In addition to its insurance
assessment, each insured bank is subject in 2004 to quarterly debt service assessments in connection with bonds issued by a government corporation that financed the federal savings and loans bailout. The first quarter 2004 debt service assessment is
..0154%.

Control Acquisitions

The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from
acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve Board, the acquisition of 10% or
more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, such as the Corporation, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of
control of the Corporation.

In addition, any company is
required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding common stock of the Corporation, or otherwise obtaining
control or a “controlling influence” over the Corporation or its banking subsidiaries.

Interstate Banking and Branching

The Riegle-Neal Act enacted in 1994 permits an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company, with Federal Reserve Board approval, to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the
bank holding company’s home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law. In addition, national banks and state banks with different home states are permitted to merge across state lines, with the approval of
the appropriate federal banking agency, unless the home state of a participating banking institution has passed legislation prior to that date that expressly prohibits interstate mergers. De novo interstate branching is permitted if the laws of the
host state so authorize. Thrift institutions (like Northern Trust Bank, FSB) may freely engage in de novo branching on an interstate basis. Moreover, national banks, like many of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries, may provide trust
services in any state to the same extent as a trust company chartered by that state.

Community Reinvestment Act

The
Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and
moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to
establish branches, merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 requires federal banking agencies to make public a
rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance record of its bank subsidiaries is reviewed by federal banking agencies in connection with the filing of an application to acquire
ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or thrift or to merge with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction. Each of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries, including
the Bank, received at least a satisfactory CRA rating from its regulator at its most recent CRA examination.



Privacy

The GLBA also establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by, among other provisions, requiring banks to adopt and disclose privacy
policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain rules with respect to the disclosure to third parties of consumer information. The Corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to the GLBA. In
addition, the GLBA requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups that relate to the CRA, and contains various other provisions designed to improve the delivery of financial services to consumers while maintaining an appropriate
level of safety in the financial services industry.

Consumer Laws and
Regulations

In addition to the laws and regulations
discussed herein, the Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in
Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act,
among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with
such customers. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties, operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution.

Future Legislation

Various legislation is from time to time introduced in Congress and state legislatures with respect to the regulation of financial institutions. Such
legislation may change the banking statutes and the operating environment of the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. The Corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential legislation, or
implementing regulations, if enacted, would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Corporation or its banking subsidiaries.

STAFF

Northern Trust employed 8,056 full-time equivalent officers and staff members as of December 31, 2003.
