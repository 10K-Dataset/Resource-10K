PART I

Item 1—Business

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION

Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) is a
financial holding company that is a leading provider of asset servicing, fund administration, investment management, banking and fiduciary solutions for corporations, institutions and affluent individuals worldwide. The Corporation conducts business
through various U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, including The Northern Trust Company (Bank). The Corporation was originally formed as a holding company for the Bank in 1971. The Corporation has 79 offices in 18 U.S. states and 16 international
locations outside the U.S. At December 31, 2009, the Corporation had consolidated total assets of $82.1 billion and stockholders’ equity of $6.3 billion.

The Bank is an Illinois banking corporation headquartered in the Chicago financial district and the Corporation’s principal subsidiary. Founded in 1889, the Bank conducts its business through its
U.S. operations and its various U.S. and non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009, the Bank had consolidated assets of $68.8 billion and common equity capital of $4.8 billion.

The Corporation expects that, although the operations of other banking and non-banking subsidiaries will continue to be of increasing
significance, the Bank will in the foreseeable future continue to be the major source of the Corporation’s consolidated assets, revenues, and net income. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term “Northern Trust” refers to
Northern Trust Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. A complete list of the Corporation’s direct and indirect subsidiaries is filed as Exhibit 21 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated into this Item by
reference.

BUSINESS UNITS

Under the leadership of Frederick H. Waddell, the Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, Northern Trust organizes its services globally around its two
client-focused principal business units: Corporate and Institutional Services (C&IS) and Personal Financial Services (PFS). Two other business units provide services to the two principal business units: Northern Trust Global Investments (NTGI),
which provides investment management, and Operations and Technology (O&T), which provides operating and systems support.

Financial information regarding the Corporation and its business units is included in the Corporation’s Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2009. In particular, for a discussion of significant
developments in the business of the Corporation, and the impact on the financial results of the Corporation and its business units for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, you are urged to review the section entitled “Consolidated
Results of Operations” on pages 24 through 32 of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Corporation’s Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2009, which
is incorporated herein by reference.

The following is a brief summary of each business unit’s activities and the
activities of the Corporate Financial Management Group and the Corporate Risk Management Group.

Corporate and Institutional Services

C&IS is a leading global provider of asset servicing, asset management, and related services to corporate and public
retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, and government funds. C&IS also offers a full range of commercial banking services, placing special emphasis on developing and supporting institutional relationships
in two target markets: large and mid-sized corporations and financial institutions. Asset servicing, asset management, and related services encompass a full range of state-of-the-art capabilities including: global master trust and custody, trade
settlement, and reporting; fund administration; cash management; investment risk and performance analytical services; and investment operations outsourcing. Client relationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the
Corporation’s subsidiaries, including support from international locations in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. Asset servicing relationships managed by C&IS often include investment management, securities
lending, transition management, and commission recapture services provided through NTGI. C&IS also provides related foreign exchange services in the U.S., U.K., and Singapore. At December 31, 2009, total C&IS assets under custody were
$3.3 trillion and assets under management were $482.0 billion.



Personal Financial Services

PFS provides personal trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services; financial consulting; guardianship and estate
administration; brokerage services; and private and business banking. PFS focuses on high net worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. PFS
also includes the Wealth Management Group, which provides customized products and services to meet the complex financial needs of individuals and family offices in the United States and throughout the world with assets typically exceeding $200
million.

PFS is one of the largest providers of personal trust services in the United States, with $331.1 billion in assets
under custody and $145.2 billion in assets under management at December 31, 2009. PFS services are delivered through a network of 79 offices in 18 U.S. states as well as offices in London and Guernsey.

Northern Trust Global Investments

NTGI, through various subsidiaries of the Corporation, provides a broad range of investment management and related services and other products to U.S. and non-U.S. clients, including clients of C&IS and PFS. Clients include
institutional and individual separately managed accounts, bank common and collective funds, registered investment companies, non-U.S. collective investment funds and unregistered private investment funds. NTGI offers both active and passive equity
and fixed income portfolio management, as well as alternative asset classes (such as private equity and hedge funds of funds) and multi-manager products and services. NTGI’s activities also include brokerage, securities lending, transition
management, and related services. NTGI’s business operates internationally through subsidiaries, joint ventures, alliances, and distribution arrangements.

Operations and Technology

O&T supports all of Northern Trust’s
business activities, including the processing and product management activities of C&IS, PFS, and NTGI. These activities are conducted principally in the operations and technology centers in Chicago, London, and Bangalore and fund administration
centers in Ireland.

Corporate Financial Management Group

The Corporate Financial Management Group includes the Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Treasurer, Corporate Development, Investor Relations, and Procurement functions. The Group is responsible for
Northern Trust’s accounting and financial infrastructure and for managing the Corporation’s financial position.

Corporate Risk
Management Group

The Corporate Risk Management Group includes the Credit Policy and other Corporate Risk Management
functions. The Credit Policy function is described in the “Loans and Other Extensions of Credit” section of the Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2009 on pages 52-59. The Corporate Risk Management Group
monitors, measures, and facilitates the management of risks across the businesses of the Corporation and its subsidiaries.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES

The earnings of Northern Trust are affected by numerous external
influences. Chief among these are general economic conditions, both domestic and international, and actions that governments and their central banks take in managing their economies. These general conditions affect all of Northern Trust’s
businesses, as well as the quality, value, and profitability of their loan and investment portfolios.

The Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) is an important regulator of U.S. economic conditions and has the general objective of promoting orderly economic growth in the United States. Implementation of this objective is accomplished by
the Federal Reserve Board’s open market operations in United States Government securities, its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from Federal Reserve Banks and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits.
The policies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board may strongly influence interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds. Fiscal policies in the
United States and abroad also affect the composition and use of Northern Trust’s resources.



COMPETITION

The businesses in which Northern Trust operates are very competitive. Competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial
services organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and global markets in which Northern Trust conducts operations.

Northern Trust’s principal business strategy is to provide quality financial services to targeted market segments in which it believes it has a competitive advantage and favorable growth prospects.
As part of this strategy, Northern Trust seeks to deliver a level of service to its clients that distinguishes it from its competitors. In addition, Northern Trust emphasizes the development and growth of recurring sources of fee-based income and is
one of a select group of major bank holding companies in the United States that generates more revenues from fee-based services than from net interest income. Northern Trust seeks to develop and expand its recurring fee-based revenue by identifying
selected markets with good growth characteristics and providing a high level of individualized service to its clients in those markets. Northern Trust also seeks to preserve its asset quality through established credit review procedures and to
maintain a conservative balance sheet. Finally, Northern Trust seeks to operate with a strong management team that includes senior officers having broad experience and long tenures.

Commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions actively compete for deposits, and money market funds and
investment banking firms offer deposit-like services. These institutions, as well as consumer and commercial finance companies, national retail chains, factors, insurance companies, and pension trusts, are important competitors for various types of
loans. Issuers of commercial paper compete actively for funds and reduce demand for bank loans. For personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling services, trust companies, investment banking firms, insurance companies, investment
counseling firms, and others offer active competition.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

Financial Holding Company Regulation

Under U.S. law, the Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) as amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
(GLBA). Consequently, the Corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision, examination, and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. The BHCA and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding
companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Supervision and
regulation of bank holding companies, financial holding companies, and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries, the deposit insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC), and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of stockholders or other creditors.

Under the
BHCA, bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking. As a financial holding company, the Corporation is permitted to engage in other
activities that the Federal Reserve Board, working with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a
substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities. Activities defined to be financial in nature include: providing financial or
investment advice; securities underwriting and dealing; insurance underwriting; and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies, subject to significant limitations. They also include activities previously determined by
the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The Corporation may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class
of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

In order to maintain the Corporation’s status as a financial holding company, each of the Corporation’s insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain “well capitalized” and
“well managed” under applicable regulations, and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements would
mean, depending on the requirements not met, that the Corporation could not undertake new activities, make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies, or continue certain activities.



Subsidiary Regulation

The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, its deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum authorized limit, and it is subject to regulation by both these entities, as well as by the
Division of Banking of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. The Bank is registered as a government securities dealer in accordance with the Government Securities Act of 1986. As a government securities dealer, its
activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of the Treasury. The Bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the Federal Reserve Board and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board
in this area. In addition, the Corporation, the Bank and the Corporation’s New York trust company subsidiary are subject to regulation by the Banking Department of the State of New York.

The Corporation’s national bank subsidiaries are members of the Federal Reserve System and are subject to regulation by the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), with deposits insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and FDIC regulations. Northern Trust Bank, FSB is a federal savings bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve
System and is subject to regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision and the FDIC. Its deposits are insured by the FDIC.

The Corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Its broker-dealer subsidiary is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is a member of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies. Several subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. Other subsidiaries are regulated by the Connecticut Department of Banking and the Office of the State Bank Commissioner in Delaware. Two families of mutual funds for which the Bank acts as investment adviser and
one registered closed-end hedge fund of funds for which another subsidiary serves as investment adviser are subject to regulation by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Functional Regulation

Enacted in late 1999, the GLBA established a system
of federal and state regulation based on functional regulation, meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that
activity. Banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators, insurance by state insurance regulators, and securities activities by the SEC and state securities regulators.

A significant component of the functional regulation provided in the GLBA relates to the application of federal securities laws and SEC
oversight of some bank securities activities previously exempt from broker-dealer regulation. Among other things, the GLBA amended the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the Exchange Act to remove the blanket exemption
for banks. Without this blanket exemption, banks may conduct securities activities without broker-dealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activity-based exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities
traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities. Securities activities outside these exemptions, as a practical matter, need to be conducted by a registered broker-dealer affiliate. The SEC and the Federal Reserve Board in
September 2007 adopted a regulation to implement the broker activities exemption of the GLBA that became effective for the Bank beginning January 1, 2009. The GLBA also amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require the registration of
any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds. The Corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of GLBA and the regulations adopted under
them.

Non-U.S. Regulation

The increasingly important activities of the Corporation’s subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by a number of non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Subsidiaries conducting
banking, fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the United Kingdom, for example, are authorized to do so pursuant to the UK Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 or are otherwise subject to regulation by the Financial Services
Authority (FSA). The FSA exercises broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations, suspend registered
employees, and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees. The non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Corporation and branches of the Bank outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities
of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Additionally, Northern Trust’s subsidiary banks located outside the U.S. are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of December 31, 2009, each
of Northern Trust’s non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements.



Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and Other Market-Support Measures

In response to the global credit and liquidity crisis impacting financial institutions both domestically and internationally, the United
States government, particularly the U.S. Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury), the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have taken a number of extraordinary measures designed to restore confidence in the financial markets and to strengthen
financial institutions, including capital injections, guarantees of bank liabilities, and the creation of special finance facilities. On October 3, 2008, the United States Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008
(EESA), under which the U.S. Treasury is granted broad authority to take a range of actions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets.

The Corporation’s participation in these various programs has been limited to the capital purchase program (CPP) under the Troubled
Assets Relief Program (TARP), participation by certain of its subsidiary depository institutions in the FDIC’s Transaction Account Guarantee Program, and by certain funds advised by a subsidiary of the Corporation in the Temporary Guaranty
Program for Money Market Funds, each of which is described below. However, the Corporation continues to monitor each of the programs announced to date and the other legislative and regulatory developments that continue to emerge in reaction to the
global financial crisis and evaluate the need for, and the relative advantages and disadvantages to, participation by the Corporation in those various programs.

Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) —

Under TARP, the U.S. Treasury has authorized a voluntary CPP to purchase up to $250 billion of senior preferred shares and warrants of qualifying
financial institutions that elect to participate. On November 14, 2008, as part of the CPP, the Corporation issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury (i) 1,576,000 shares of the Corporation’s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred
Stock, Series B, without par value and having a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, and (ii) a ten-year warrant to purchase up to 3,824,624 shares of the Corporation’s common stock, at an exercise price of $61.81 per share, for an
aggregate purchase price of $1.576 billion in cash. On June 17, 2009, the Corporation repurchased all of the preferred stock issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP. On August 26, 2009, the Corporation repurchased the warrant to
purchase shares of common stock that the Corporation issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP, completing the Corporation’s participation in the CPP.

Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Mutual Funds —

In late September 2008, the U.S. Treasury opened its Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Mutual Funds (Temporary Guarantee
Program). The U.S. Treasury will guarantee the share price of any publicly–offered eligible money market fund that applies for and pays a fee to participate in the Temporary Guarantee Program. The Temporary Guarantee Program was designed to
address temporary dislocations in credit markets. Initially, the program was going to run through April 30, 2009 but it was extended to September 18, 2009, at which point the program expired. Certain funds advised by a subsidiary of the
Corporation have participated in this program.

Cross-Guarantees Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control, each of those
depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred, or expected to be incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the default of any of the others. Each also may be liable for any assistance the FDIC provides to the other institutions.
“Default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution. Thus, any of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the FDIC if the FDIC were to suffer a loss in connection with any of the
Corporation’s other banking subsidiaries. This cross-guarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities, secured obligations, any other general or senior
liability, and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors, other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution (with certain exceptions). Although neither the Corporation nor any of its nonbanking
subsidiaries may be assessed for such loss under the FDIA, the Corporation has agreed to indemnify each of its banking subsidiaries, other than the Bank, for any payments a banking subsidiary may be required to make to the FDIC pursuant to these
provisions of the FDIA.

Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of
financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve Board at times when, absent this Federal Reserve Board policy, it would not otherwise be
provided. The Corporation has source of strength agreements in place with its existing subsidiaries evidencing its commitment to provide such support as needed. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository
institution subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks.



Payment of Dividends

The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The principal source of funds for the Corporation is dividends from the Bank. As a result, the Corporation’s ability to
pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations. Dividend payments from the Bank are subject to Illinois law and to regulatory
limitations, generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings, imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying
dividends would impair its profitability, financial condition or other cash flow requirements.

The Federal Reserve Board has
issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies. The policy statement provides that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net
income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial
condition. Accordingly, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health, such as by borrowing.

Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to the Corporation without regulatory
approval. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the
total of its retained net income (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided
profits, as defined, without regulatory and stockholder approval.

The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying
any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized. In addition, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The payment of dividends
could, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

Capital Adequacy
Requirements

The Federal Reserve Board has established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding
companies. The minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet items such as standby letters of credit) is eight percent. At least half of the total
capital must be composed of common stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings), qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (and, for bank holding companies only, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred
stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities), and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other disallowed intangibles, and disallowed deferred tax assets, among other items (Tier 1
Capital). The Federal Reserve Board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies, requiring Tier 1 Capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets.

The federal banking regulators have also established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines that insured banks and thrifts are required
to meet. These regulations are generally similar to those established by the Federal Reserve Board for bank holding companies. The risk-based and leverage capital ratios for the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries, together with the
regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “well-capitalized,” are provided in the following chart.



The Corporation also is subject to the framework for risk-based capital adequacy, sometimes
referred to as Basel II, which was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and has been endorsed by the central bank governors and heads of bank supervision of the G10 countries. In December 2007, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies
published final rules, effective April 1, 2008, with respect to implementation of the Basel II framework, the latest agreed-version of which was released by the Basel Committee in November 2005.

Under the final Basel II rules, the Corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations. As a result, the
Corporation and its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries will be required to use the advanced approaches under Basel II for calculating risk-based capital related to credit risk and operational risk, instead of the methodology reflected in the
regulations effective prior to adoption of Basel II. The new rules also require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles, and to publicly disclose certain
information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy.

In order to implement the new rules, a core banking organization
such as the Corporation was required to (and the Corporation did) adopt an implementation plan by October 1, 2008 and must satisfactorily complete a four-quarter parallel run, in which it calculates capital requirements under both the Basel II
rules and regulations effective prior to the adoption of Basel II. The organization must then progress through three transitional periods of at least four quarters each, commencing no later than April 1, 2011. During these transitional periods,
the maximum cumulative reduction in capital requirements from those under the regulations effective prior to adoption of Basel II may not exceed 5% for the first period, 10% for the second period and 15% for the third period. Supervisory approval is
required to move through these transitional periods and out of the final transitional period. The agencies also have said they will publish a study after the end of the second transitional year that will examine the new framework for any
deficiencies.

Non-core U.S. banking organizations that qualify may elect to use the most advanced approaches under Basel II.
The agencies in July 2008 also published a notice of proposed rule-making that would provide all non-core banking organizations with the option to adopt a standardized approach under Basel II, which reflects a simpler methodology than the advanced
approaches required of core banking organizations.

The Corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the
advanced approaches of the Basel II framework. The Corporation has established a Program Management Office to oversee the implementation of Basel II across the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries. The Corporation is also addressing issues related
to implementation timing differences between the U.S. and other jurisdictions, to ensure that the Corporation and the bank subsidiaries comply with regulatory requirements and expectations in all jurisdictions where they operate. The
Corporation’s U.K., Guernsey and Canadian entities subject to Basel II rules have already adopted or plan to adopt the standardized approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk in calculating minimum regulatory
capital requirements.

Preliminary analysis of the Basel II risk-based capital framework suggests that the use of the advanced
approaches of the Basel II framework will not result in the Corporation’s or the Bank’s Tier 1 Capital or total risk-based capital ratios falling below the levels required for categorization as “well capitalized.”

Prompt Corrective Action

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, the federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized U.S. depository institutions. U.S. depository institutions
are assigned one of five capital categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized,” and are subjected
to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls. Under certain circumstances, a well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in
the next lower capital category. A depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions (including paying dividends) or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized.
Adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the FDIC, and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions may
not accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits.



The federal banking regulatory agencies are permitted or, in certain cases, required to take
certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories. Depending on the level of an institution’s capital, the agency’s corrective powers include, among other things:

•

prohibiting the payment of principal and interest on subordinated debt;

•

prohibiting any distributions without prior regulatory approval;

•

placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities;

•

placing additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates;

•

restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits;

•

prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; and

•

in the most severe cases, appointing a conservator or receiver for the institution.

A banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan, and such a plan will not be accepted
unless, among other things, the banking institution’s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in
bankruptcy. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and restrictions on certain business activities.
As of December 31, 2009, the Corporation and all of its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized.”

In the release adopting final Basel II rules, the federal banking agencies said that these “prompt corrective action” rules will
not be affected by the Basel II process and that core banking organizations will be required, during the transitional period, to use the lowest capital calculation in each category that results from the application of both the new and the old rules.

Enforcement Powers of the Federal Banking Agencies

The federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to issue cease and desist orders, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, terminate deposit
insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory agreements could subject the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries, as well as officers, directors, and other
institution-affiliated parties of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties. In addition to the grounds discussed under “Prompt Corrective Action,” the appropriate federal banking
agency may appoint the FDIC as conservator or receiver for a banking institution (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist, including, without limitation, the fact that the
banking institution:

•

is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized;

•

fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so;

•

fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan; or

•

materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan.



Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders

The Corporation’s bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions under federal law, including Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Board,
which limit certain transactions with the Corporation and its non-banking subsidiaries, including loans, other extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases. Such transactions by a banking subsidiary with any one affiliate are limited in
amount to 10 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus and, with all affiliates together, to an aggregate of 20 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus. Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit, as well as certain other
transactions, are required to be secured in specified amounts. These and certain other transactions with the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, including any payment of money by a banking subsidiary, must be on terms and conditions that are, or
in good faith would be, offered to nonaffiliated companies.

The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers,
principal stockholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as “insiders”) contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O apply to all federally insured institutions. These restrictions include limits on
loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests. These loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired
capital and surplus, and the FDIC may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions. Regulation O institutions are not subject to the
prohibitions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 on certain loans to insiders.

Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Legislation

The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 includes the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001,
which contains anti-money laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions. These measures are in addition to requirements contained in the Bank Secrecy Act. The Money Laundering
Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act requires U.S. financial institutions to adopt policies and procedures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing and grants the Secretary of the Treasury and bank regulatory agencies broad authority
to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions’ operations as well as sanctions for failure to meet regulatory requirements. The Corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with
these laws and the related regulations.

Deposit Insurance

Under the FDIC’s risk-based insurance assessment system, as amended by the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act and implementing
regulations effective for 2009, each insured bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. Each insured bank is placed in one of four risk categories based on its level of capital, supervisory ratings and other risk
measures, including debt ratings for large institutions, and its insurance assessment rate is determined by its risk category.

On February 27, 2009, the FDIC issued a final rule that revises the way the FDIC calculates federal deposit insurance assessment rates beginning in the second quarter of 2009. Under the new rule, the FDIC first establishes an
institution’s initial base assessment rate. This initial base assessment rate will range, depending on the risk category of the institution, from 12 to 45 basis points. The FDIC will then adjust the initial base assessment (higher or lower) to
obtain the total base assessment rate. The adjustments to the initial base assessment rate will be based upon an institution’s levels of unsecured debt, secured liabilities, and brokered deposits. The total base assessment rate will range from
7 to 77.5 basis points of the institution’s deposits.

On May 22, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule levying a five
basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution’s assets minus its Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009. We recorded an expense of $20.2 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2009 to reflect the special
assessment.

On November 12, 2009, the FDIC issued a final rule pursuant to which all insured depository institutions
will be required to prepay their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012 on December 30, 2009. Under the rule, the assessment rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for 2010 will be based on
each institution’s total base assessment rate for the third quarter of 2009, modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009 had been in effect for the entire third quarter, and the assessment rate for 2011 and
2012 will be equal to the modified third quarter assessment rate plus an additional 3 basis points. In addition, each institution’s base assessment rate for each period will be calculated using its third quarter 2009 assessment base, adjusted
quarterly for an estimated 5% annual growth rate in the assessment base through the end of 2012. The amount of our prepayment on December 30, 2009 was $104.9 million. This amount is amortized over the three year assessment period and will be
adjusted for actual quarterly assessments for that period.



In addition to its insurance assessment, each insured bank is subject in 2010 to quarterly
debt service assessments in connection with bonds issued by a government corporation that financed the federal savings and loans bailout. The first quarter 2010 debt service assessment is 0.0106%.

FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program

The Bank, Northern Trust, N.A., and Northern Trust Bank, FSB participated in the FDIC’s Transaction Account Guarantee Program under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. The Transaction Account
Guarantee Program provides for a temporary full guarantee by the FDIC for funds held at depository institutions in non-interest bearing transaction accounts (generally demand deposit checking accounts and NOW accounts) above the existing $250,000
deposit insurance limit. This coverage became effective on October 14, 2008 and was scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2009. Depository institutions that elected to participate are subject to an annualized assessment of 10 cents per
$100 of deposits in such non-interest bearing transaction accounts (above the existing deposit insurance limit of $250,000) that began on November 13, 2008. This assessment is in addition to the deposit insurance assessments described above
under “Deposit Insurance.”

The FDIC issued a final rule on August 27, 2009 that extended the Transaction
Account Guarantee Program coverage until June 30, 2010 for depository institutions that did not opt-out prior to November 2, 2009. The final rule also provided for a modified increased fee structure effective after December 31, 2009
for banks that decide to continue to participate in such program during the six month extension period. The Bank, Northern Trust, N.A., and Northern Trust Bank, FSB, elected to continue in the program until June 30, 2010.

Control Acquisitions

The
Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption
established by the Federal Reserve Board, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, such as the Corporation, would, under the
circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of the Corporation. In addition, any company is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an
acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding common stock of the Corporation, or otherwise obtaining control or a “controlling influence” over the Corporation or its banking subsidiaries.

Interstate Banking and Branching

The Riegle-Neal Act enacted in 1994 permits an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company, with Federal Reserve Board approval, to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding
company’s home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law. In addition, national banks and state banks with different home states are permitted to merge across state lines, with the approval of the appropriate
federal banking agency, unless the home state of a participating banking institution passed legislation prior to June 1, 1997 that expressly prohibits interstate mergers. De novo interstate branching is permitted if the laws of the host state
so authorize. Thrift institutions (like Northern Trust Bank, FSB) may freely engage in de novo branching on an interstate basis. Moreover, national banks, such as Northern Trust, NA, may provide trust services in any state to the same extent as a
trust company chartered by that state.

Community Reinvestment Act

The Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The CRA and the regulations issued
thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. These regulations also provide for
regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. The
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 requires federal banking agencies to make public a rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance record of its bank
subsidiaries is reviewed by federal banking agencies in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or thrift or to merge with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory record
can substantially delay or block the transaction. Each of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries, including the Bank, received at least a satisfactory CRA rating from its regulator in its most recent CRA examination.



In addition, the GLBA requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups
that relate to the CRA, and contains various other provisions designed to improve the delivery of financial services to consumers while maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial services industry.

Privacy and Security

The
GLBA also establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by, among other provisions, requiring banks to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain rules with respect to the
disclosure to third parties of consumer information. The Corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to the GLBA. Regulations adopted under the GLBA set standards for protecting the security, confidentiality and integrity
of customer information, and require notice to regulators, and in some cases, to customers, in the event of security breaches. A number of states have adopted their own statutes requiring notification of security breaches.

Consumer Laws and Regulations

In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above, the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the
following list is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act,
the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the
manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers and monitor account activity when taking deposits, making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such customers. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations
could lead to substantial penalties, operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution.

Future Legislation

Various legislation is from time to time introduced in Congress and state legislatures with respect to the regulation of
financial institutions, and legislation designed to fundamentally restructure financial regulation has been introduced as one response to the recent global credit and liquidity crisis. For example, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed
legislation that would, among other things, create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency that would have broad powers to regulate consumer financial services and products, create a Financial Stability Oversight Council with regulatory authority
over certain financial companies and activities, and would give shareholders a “say on pay” regarding executive compensation. The Federal Reserve also issued proposed guidance on incentive compensation to ensure that banking
organizations’ incentive compensation policies do not undermine the safety and soundness or their organizations. Such legislation may change the banking statutes and the operating environment of the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries in
substantial and unpredictable ways. The Corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential legislation, or implementing regulations, if enacted, would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Corporation or its
banking subsidiaries.

Reserve for Credit Losses Relating to Non-U.S. Operations

The SEC requires the disclosure of the reserve for
credit losses that is applicable to international operations. The above table has been prepared in compliance with this disclosure requirement and is used in determining non-U.S. operating performance. The amounts shown in the table should not be
construed as being the only amounts that are available for non-U.S. loan charge-offs, since the entire reserve for credit losses assigned to loans and leases is available to absorb losses on both U.S. and non-U.S. loans. In addition, these amounts
are not intended to be indicative of future charge-off trends.

Supplemental Item—Executive Officers of the Registrant

The following table sets forth certain information with regard to each executive officer of the Corporation.

With the exception of Ms. Blake, all of the executive officers have been officers of the Corporation, or a subsidiary of the Corporation, for more than five years. The prior business experience of
Ms. Blake is set forth below:

Aileen B. Blake: November 2004-March 2005—Executive Vice President and
Controller-Designate; April 2003-November 2004—Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis at PepsiCo Beverages and Foods (formerly, The Quaker Oats Company); 1993-April 2003—various financial positions in auditing and financial
planning at The Quaker Oats Company and PepsiCo Beverages and Foods.

The positions of Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer and President are elected annually by the Board of Directors at the first meeting of the Board of Directors held after each annual meeting of stockholders. The other officers are appointed annually by the Board. Officers continue to hold
office until their successors are duly elected or until their death, resignation or removal by the Board.

Item 1A—Risk Factors

From an investor’s standpoint, public companies
in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks. However, each company’s unique combination of strategies, markets served, product and service offerings, processes and systems, and other internal and external
factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks. Following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in Northern Trust’s business.



We explain below that many of the risks we discuss can reduce our earnings, as a result of
recognizing losses or otherwise. You should understand that significant reductions in earnings can have further negative effects on us in addition to reducing the price of our common stock and other securities, such as: reducing our capital, which
can have regulatory and other consequences; affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us, with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses; and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to
rating agencies and potential purchasers and so affecting our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so.

This list is not necessarily complete because we may have failed to appreciate the potential impact on us of risks not described here. We identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans
and our risk management practices and controls.

If we fail to continue to successfully identify and manage significant risks, we could incur financial loss. We may also suffer damage to our reputation that would restrict our ability to grow or
conduct business profitably, or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that would limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive

.

Economic, Market, and Monetary Policy Risks

Northern Trust carries on a
global business. Changes in conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions both in the U.S. and internationally could adversely affect Northern Trust’s businesses. Factors such as the level and volatility of equity
and futures prices, the overall pace of capital markets activities, interest rates, currency exchange rates, investor sentiment and inflation or deflation can affect our results.

•

A downturn in economic conditions, such as the current severe global economic downturn, can negatively affect our earnings

.

-

Economic weakness can affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans, causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit,
a higher level of charge-offs, and higher provision for credit losses, all of which reduce our earnings.

-

Economic weakness can also reduce the fees we earn for managing and servicing our customers’ assets. For example, the current downturn in equity
markets and the decrease in the value of some debt-related investments as a result of market disruption or illiquidity reduce the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others. This reduces our earnings since a significant part of the
fees we earn is based on asset values.

-

Weak economic conditions also affect wealth creation, investment preferences, trading activities, and savings patterns, which impact demand for our
trust and investment products and services. Reduced transaction volumes would also negatively impact our earnings.

•

A slowing of the globalization of investment activity or pension reform could limit our revenue growth

. We believe we have profited from the
increasing globalization of investment activity and from pension reform in many nations that has generated new pools of assets that require management and servicing. Any slowing or reversal of this globalization of financial activity and markets or
other such trends would adversely affect factors that have been important in Northern Trust’s recent growth.

•

Instability, disruption or a lack of confidence in the political, economic, legal or regulatory systems of the emerging markets in which we operate
could expose us to liability or loss

. Northern Trust’s expanding business activities in emerging markets, including investments made for clients in those markets, present the risks inherent in conducting these activities in less mature and
often less regulated business and investment environments.

•

Changes in interest rates can negatively affect our earnings

. The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings.
Falling rates or rates that remain low can reduce our net interest margin, which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. Rates that remain low can also reduce fees
earned on certain of our products. For example, in 2009, we waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the low level of short-term interest rates. Lower net interest margins and fee waivers negatively impact our earnings.



•

Fluctuations and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can negatively affect our earnings

. We hold various non-U.S. dollar denominated
assets and liabilities and maintain investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. We also provide foreign exchange services to our clients, primarily in connection with our global custody business, and effect other transactions in non-U.S. dollar
currencies. Foreign currency volatility and fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets, investments, and cash flows and raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions,
where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other, or offset each other in different time periods. If the policies and procedures we have in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts
of foreign exchange volatility, including hedging-related strategies, are not followed or are not effective to mitigate such risks, our results and earnings may be negatively affected. In addition, periods of lower foreign currency volatility can
result in reduced foreign exchange trading income, as occurred in the second half of 2009. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Risk Management
– Market Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Foreign Exchange Risk Management” in the 2009 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 61 – 62).

•

Declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can negatively affect our earnings

. The value of securities available for
sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and adverse economic or financial market conditions. Generally, the fair value of those securities is determined based upon market values
available from third party sources. The current period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption has negatively affected the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and asset-backed securities in particular. To the extent that any
portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities results from declines in securities values that management determines to be other-than-temporary, the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated
recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned
“Risk Management – Asset Quality and Credit Risk Management – Securities Portfolio” in the 2009 Annual Report to Stockholders (page 52) and the section of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2009
Annual Report to Stockholders captioned “Note 3 – Securities” (pages 77—80) for additional information.

•

Changes in a number of particular market conditions can negatively affect our earnings

. In past periods, reductions in the volatility of
currency trading markets, the level of cross-border investing activity, or the demand for borrowed securities have negatively affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending. If these conditions occur in
the future, our earnings from these activities may be negatively affected. In a few of our businesses, such as securities lending, we are compensated through sharing in our client’s earnings, so that market and other factors that reduce our
clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues. The current extraordinary market conditions have produced losses in some securities lending programs, which has negatively affected our earnings. These market
conditions have led some clients to withdraw from these programs, and a persistence or worsening of these conditions could result in additional withdrawals and negatively affect earnings. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements – Variable Interests” in the 2009 Annual Report to Stockholders (page 46) and the section of the “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” in the 2009 Annual Report to Stockholders captioned “Note 26 – Variable Interest Entities” (pages 105 – 106) for additional information.

•

Changes in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the United States, non-U.S. governments and
international agencies can reduce our earnings and negatively affect our growth prospects

. For example, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, and its policies
determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing. Changes in interest rates and our cost of funds can negatively affect earnings. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board can reduce the value of
financial instruments we hold. Its policies also can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available. This can increase the risk that they may fail to repay their loans from us.

•

Failure to develop and implement contingency plans to address market disruptions could adversely affect us.

Our success in the area of highly
complex asset servicing relationships depends, in part, on our development and successful implementation of contingency plans to address significant market disruptions caused by bankruptcy, insolvency or illiquidity.



•

Governmental action to combat current economic weakness and financial market disruption may not succeed, with various adverse effects on us.

Since mid-2008, there have been unprecedented disruptions in global financial markets, including volatility in asset values and constraints on the availability of credit. In response to these developments, the U.S. and other governments have taken
steps designed to stabilize markets generally and strengthen financial institutions in particular. The current upheaval in global financial markets has accentuated each of the risks identified above and magnified their potential effect on Northern
Trust. To the extent that these governmental stabilization and mitigation activities are not successful or adversely change the competitive structure of the financial services industry, these developments could have an adverse impact on Northern
Trust’s revenues, costs, credit losses, access to capital, and liquidity. They also may impose additional limitations or costs on Northern Trust’s business.

Operational Risks

•

Errors, breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can
subject us to liability, result in losses or negatively affect our earnings in other ways

. In our asset servicing, investment management, and other business activities, Northern Trust effects or processes transactions for clients and for itself
that involve very large amounts of money. Failure to properly manage or mitigate operational risks can have substantial consequences, and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses.

•

Many types of operational risks can negatively affect our earnings

. Many factors can impact operations and expose us to risks that may vary in
size, scale and scope, including:

-

Human errors or omissions, including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures;

-

Theft, fraud or misappropriation of assets, whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties;

-

Defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems;

-

Breakdowns in processes, including manual processes, which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes, and over-reliance on manual
processes, breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the technology and facilities that support our operations;

-

Unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades;

-

Defects in product design or delivery;

-

Difficulty in accurately pricing assets, which can be aggravated by increased asset coverage, market volatility and illiquidity, and lack of reliable
pricing from vendors;

-

Negative developments in relationships with key counterparties, vendors, employees, or associates in our day-to-day operations; and

-

External events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as natural disasters, epidemics, computer viruses, geopolitical events, political
unrest or terrorist events.

•

Our dependence on automation exposes us to risks that can also result in losses

. Automated systems to record and process transactions, as well
as to monitor positions and price assets, can reduce the risk of human error, but our necessary dependence on such systems also increases the risk that system flaws, human tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses. The failure
to upgrade systems as necessary to support growth and changing business needs could also have a material adverse effect. Additionally, failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business changes prior to and during introduction
and deployment of key technological systems or failure to adequately align evolving client commitments and expectations with operational capabilities can have a negative impact on our operations.

•

We may fail to detect errors resulting in losses that continue until the problems are detected and fixed

. Given the high volume of transactions
we process, errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected.



•

Our business continuity plans may not work and thus fail to prevent losses from operational failures

. Our business continuity plans address many
of these risks, but may not operate successfully to mitigate them. If they do not, we could incur losses, liability to clients or others and reduced earnings. In recent years, we have expanded the operational support located in lower-cost areas,
where the electricity, communications and other systems necessary to support our activities may not be as strong as in the U.S. This increases the risk that problems with these systems may occur and disrupt our operations, resulting in losses.

These risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex, and as our increasingly international
business requires end-to-end management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many inter-related products and services.

Investment Performance, Fiduciary and Asset Servicing Risks

Revenues from our investment management,
fiduciary, and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings.

•

Failure to produce adequate and competitive returns can negatively affect our earnings and growth prospects

. If we do not generate competitive
risk-adjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes, we will have greater difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business, which would negatively affect our earnings and prospects.

•

If we fail to comply with legal standards, we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients, which would negatively affect our earnings

.
Managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important to client satisfaction, which in turn is important to the earnings and growth of our investment businesses.
Failure to comply with these standards, adequately manage these risks, or manage the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities could also result in liability.

•

We may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings

. We may find it necessary to take action or incur
expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings, liquidity or valuation issues or other developments, even though we are not
required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments. For example, we entered into credit support agreements with respect to certain investment funds and we incurred substantial charges to reflect that support in the third quarter of 2008.
These credit support agreements expired in 2009. We incurred other significant charges in that quarter to support securities lending clients and clients who had purchased certain illiquid auction rate securities. The risk that we will need to take
such action and incur the resulting losses is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted, as they have been in recent months.

Credit Risks

A number of Northern Trust’s product offerings involve credit risk, which is the risk that other parties will not fulfill their financial obligations to us. These product offerings include loans,
leases and other lending commitments.

•

Failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain adequate reserves for credit losses can result in
losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings

. We evaluate credit commitments before we make them and then reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent
in our loan portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. This process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments. Challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessment
and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors. Reserves that prove to be inadequate can directly and negatively affect earnings.



•

Weakened economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings

.
Credit risk levels and our earnings can also be affected by the strength of the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit and adverse changes in the
financial performance or condition of our borrowers which could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans. In 2009, our provision for credit losses increased significantly. The higher provision for credit losses reflects the
continued weak economic environment. For a fuller discussion of the reserve and provision for credit losses for 2009, 2008, and 2007, see the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” captioned “Asset Quality and Credit Risk Management” in the 2009 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 52 – 59).

•

The failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss

. The financial markets are characterized by
extensive interconnections among financial institutions, including banks, broker/dealers, collective investment funds and insurance companies. As a result of these interconnections, we and many of our customers have significant counterparty exposure
to other financial institutions. This counterparty exposure presents significant risks to us and to our customers because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties (or in some cases of our customers’ counterparties) has the
potential to expose us to risk of loss. The recent instability of the financial markets has resulted in many financial institutions becoming significantly less creditworthy, and as a result we are exposed to increased counterparty risks, both as
principal and in our capacity as agent for our customers. Changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly, is often based upon a variety of factors and is difficult to predict. In
addition, as U.S. and non-U.S. governments have addressed the financial crisis in an evolving manner, the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain. If a
significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us, we could incur financial losses that materially adversely affect our business, our financial condition and our results of operations. Given the limited number of strong
counterparties in the current market, we are not able to mitigate all of our and our customers’ counterparty credit risk. The current consolidation of financial service firms and the failures of other financial institutions have increased the
concentration of our counterparty risk.

Liquidity Risks

Northern Trust depends on access to capital markets to provide sufficient capital resources and other funds to meet our commitments and
business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients.

•

Many events or circumstances could adversely affect our capital costs, our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our ability to meet our
commitments

. Inadequate capital or the inability to meet our commitments could cause us to incur liability, restrict our ability to grow, or require us to take actions that would negatively affect our earnings. Among the developments that could
have this effect are:

-

A loss of confidence of debt purchasers, depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets generally or in transactions with Northern
Trust;

-

Disruption in the market for debt-related securities; and

-

A significant downgrade of our debt rating.

See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the 2009 Annual Report to
Stockholders (pages 46 – 51).

•

Our success with large, complex clients can put strains on our balance sheet and impose substantial liquidity requirements.

Our failure to
successfully manage these balance sheet and liquidity issues would have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow.



•

If the Bank or the other subsidiaries of the Corporation were unable to supply the Corporation with funds over time, the Corporation could be unable
to meet its various obligations

. The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. It relies primarily on dividends paid to it by these subsidiaries to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to
stockholders of the Corporation. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank and the other subsidiaries can supply funds to the Corporation by dividend or otherwise. See “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1
of this report.

Regulation Risks

Virtually every aspect of Northern Trust’s business around the world is regulated, generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions. In the
United States, the Corporation, the Bank, and many of the Corporation’s other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. These regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required
capital levels to prohibited activities. They are specifically directed at protecting depositors, the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. The Corporation and its nonbanking subsidiaries are also
heavily regulated by regulators, including securities regulators, domestically and internationally.

•

Failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our
business, or that reduce earnings as a result of higher costs

. Regulatory violations or failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties, require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting
business, result in limitations on our ability to conduct business, restrict our ability to expand, or adversely impact our reputation.

•

Changes in laws and regulation could result in reduced earnings

. Laws, regulations, and their interpretation by regulatory agencies may change
or generate enhanced scrutiny of particular activities. Those changes or enhanced emphasis can impose costs or otherwise affect our ability to compete successfully. The disruption in financial markets may produce regulatory changes in the U.S. and
elsewhere, the effects of which are difficult to predict. In addition, evolving regulations, such as the Basel II capital regime and liquidity related regulations, and regulations that generate increased scrutiny of particular activities, such as
anti-money laundering procedures, require significant time, effort, and resources on our part to ensure compliance in a rapidly changing environment. We often must meet significant milestones in complying with these regulatory requirements. Failure
to meet these requirements and milestones could significantly and negatively affect our business. New or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry,
including Northern Trust.

•

Compliance with evolving regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies may impact us in ways that are difficult to predict.

Although our repurchase of the preferred stock and warrant we issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP eliminated restrictions placed upon us under the agreements relating to our participation in that program, in light of current
economic conditions, banks and other financial services companies such as us will continue to be subject to enhanced regulatory and enforcement scrutiny and evolving legislation and regulations in the U.S. and other countries. The full scope and
impact of existing and new regulations and of new legislation and implementing regulations that may be issued in the future is uncertain and difficult to predict.

•

Many of our new activities and expansion plans require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them will restrict our growth

. Failure to
obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could adversely affect proposed acquisitions, other business opportunities and results of operations.

See “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1 of this report.



Litigation Risks

Our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us, claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty owed to them. Our trust, custody and
investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk. This risk may be heightened during periods when credit, equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile, or when clients or investors
are experiencing losses. In addition, as a publicly-held company, we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws, and the recent volatility in the stock prices of Northern Trust and other financial institutions has increased
this risk.

•

These claims can result in significant liability or damage to our reputation, which could result in a loss.

Even where we defend them
successfully, these matters are often expensive to defend. These claims may also cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients, or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties, rating agencies, and stockholders, and so
negatively affect our earnings.

•

We may fail to set aside adequate reserves or otherwise make a mistake in evaluating our liability, with a negative effect on our earnings

. We
estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims, and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to U.S. GAAP, by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory
interpretations. This process is subject to the risk that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts, and to the risk that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the
case. Earnings will be adversely affected to the extent that our reserves are not adequate.

Tax and Accounting Risks

In the course of its business, Northern Trust is sometimes subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities
regarding the amount of taxes due.

•

These challenges can result in reduced earnings in a number of ways

. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of
taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of which can require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise negatively affect earnings.

•

Our provision for structured lease transactions may prove to be inadequate, resulting in additional tax provisions or reduced earnings

. In
recent years, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has proposed to disallow tax deductions related to certain types of structured leasing transactions. If our reserves for tax liabilities prove to be inadequate, we would have to make an additional
adjustment that would negatively affect earnings.

•

Changes in tax laws and interpretations can negatively affect our earnings

. Both U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities from time to time issue new,
or modify existing, tax laws and regulations. These authorities may also issue new, or modify existing, interpretations of those laws and regulations. These new laws, regulations or interpretations, and the Corporation’s actions taken in
response to, or reliance upon, such changes in the tax laws may impact the Corporation’s tax position in a manner that results in lower earnings.

•

Changes in accounting principles can negatively affect our earnings and capital ratios

. The Financial Accounting Standards Board and other
accounting standards-setting organizations make pronouncements and adjustments to their existing accounting guidance that may impact the manner in which the Corporation accounts for certain of its transactions in a way that results in lower earnings
or adjustments to the Corporation’s balance sheet resulting in lower capital ratios.



Strategic and Competitive Risks

We have grown through a combination of internal expansion and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities, and we intend to
continue to do so. A variety of risks could interfere with these plans.

•

Intervention of the U.S. and other governments in the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face

. In response to the
continuing disruptions in global financial markets currently being experienced, the U.S government and other governments around the world have taken, and may take further, unprecedented actions designed to stabilize markets generally and strengthen
financial institutions in particular. For example, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed legislation that would, among other things, create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency that would have broad powers to regulate consumer financial
services and products, create a Financial Stability Oversight Council with regulatory authority over certain financial companies and activities, and would give shareholders a “say on pay” regarding executive compensation. Governments also
may take actions to significantly change the way financial institutions are regulated, either through new legislation, new regulations, new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods. These actions may involve
increased intervention by such governments and regulators in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry. Such intervention may impact the nature and level of competition in the
industry in unpredictable ways. The nature, pace and volume of this government intervention, and our ability to react in a timely manner to regulatory developments, may adversely impact our ability to compete successfully and, in turn, negatively
affect our earnings.

•

If we do not successfully execute expansion plans, we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be negatively impacted

.
Failure to integrate a substantial acquisition would have an adverse effect on our business, as would the failure to execute successfully a significant internal expansion. The challenges arising from the integration of an acquired business or
significant expansion of an existing business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees, clients, suppliers, and other business partners, as well as combining accounting, data processing and internal control systems.

•

Failure to execute our other strategies could also negatively affect our prospects

. Our growth also depends upon successful, consistent
execution of our business strategies in both PFS and C&IS. Recruiting and maintaining skilled personnel, and deploying such key talent in a manner that allows execution of these strategies is important, particularly in highly complex and rapidly
growing areas of our business. A failure to do so, or to otherwise successfully carry out our plans, could negatively impact growth.

•

We face a variety of competitive challenges that could negatively affect our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings

. We
provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets, in which pricing can be a key competitive factor. Merger activity in the financial services industry, including mergers resulting from government intervention
and the overall disruption in the financial services industry, continues to produce large, in some cases well-capitalized, and geographically-diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at
competitive prices. In certain businesses, such as foreign exchange trading, electronic networks present a competitive challenge. Additionally, technological advances and the growth of internet-based commerce have made it possible for non-depository
institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business. Many of these non-traditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures. These competitive
pressures can negatively affect earnings and our ability to grow.

•

Failure to attract and retain skilled people could negatively affect our prospects.

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to
attract and retain key talent. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire and retain key personnel, including as a result of any restrictions on our compensation practices that
may be adopted by governments or regulators. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and
the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.



•

We need to constantly invest in innovation, and the inability or failure to do so will negatively affect our businesses and earnings

. Our
success in this competitive environment requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation. This investment is directed at generating new products and services, and adapting existing products and services to the evolving
standards and demands of the marketplace. Among other things, this helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins. This investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our
products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients, and includes investment in technological innovation as well. Effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product
offerings, particularly in the area of securities lending, also is important. Falling behind our competition in any of these areas could adversely affect our business opportunities, our growth and our earnings.

•

Failure to understand or fully appreciate the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will negatively
affect our businesses and earnings

. Our success in capitalizing on innovation depends, in part, on successful implementation of new product and service initiatives. Not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new
offerings, but we must accurately price them (as well as existing products) on a risk-adjusted basis and effectively deliver them to clients. Our identification of risks arising from new products and services, both in their design and
implementation, and effective responses to those identified risks, including pricing, is key to our capitalizing on innovation and investment in new product and service offerings.

•

Failure to adequately control our costs could negatively affect our ability to compete and thus reduce our earnings

. Our success in controlling
the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results. Another goal of innovation, as a part of our business strategy, is to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses, including the
costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets.

•

Our success with large, complex clients requires understanding of the market and legal, regulatory and accounting standards in new jurisdictions.

Any failure to understand and deal with those appropriately could affect our growth prospects or negatively affect our reputation.

Reputation Risks

An important reason that clients bring their business to
Northern Trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics, performance, accuracy and compliance.

•

Damage to our reputation can have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete, grow and generate revenue

. Damage to our reputation
for delivery of a high level of service undermines the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and so negatively affects our earnings.

•

Maintaining our reputation is important in other key relationships that affect our businesses and our earnings

. Damage to our reputation also
could affect the confidence of the other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business, rating agencies, and stockholders in Northern Trust. Failure to maintain our reputation would ultimately have an adverse effect on
our ability to manage our balance sheet or effect transactions.

•

Reputation risk has many facets that could negatively affect our businesses and earnings

. The maintenance of our reputation depends not only on
our success in controlling or mitigating the various risks described above, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in a broad range of areas. Reputational risk is particularly significant in the
current environment resulting from the financial crisis. These include potential conflicts of interest and other ethical issues; anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing procedures; customer personal information and privacy issues;
effective evaluation of talent and deployment to adequately address complex and rapid growing areas of our businesses, data security; record-keeping; regulatory investigations of Northern Trust or within the banking industry; and any litigation that
arises from the failure or perceived failure of Northern Trust to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.



Many of the risks described above are discussed in more detail in the section of
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Risk Management” in the 2009 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 51 – 62), in the section of the “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2009 Annual Report to Stockholders captioned “Note 23 – Contingent Liabilities” (pages 99 – 100), and in the sections of “Item 1 – Business” of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K captioned “Government Monetary and Fiscal Policies,” “Competition” and “Regulation and Supervision” (pages 2 – 11).

Additionally, the risks described above may cause actual results to differ from the Corporation’s current expectations of future events or future results indicated in what are considered
“forward-looking statements” of the Corporation. Forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results are also discussed in the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” captioned “Factors Affecting Future Results” in the 2009 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 62 – 64).

Item 1B—Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2—Properties

The executive offices of the Corporation and the Bank are located at 50 South La Salle Street in Chicago. This Bank-owned building is occupied by various divisions of Northern Trust’s business units.
Adjacent to this building are two office buildings in which the Bank leases approximately 530,000 square feet of space principally for staff divisions of the business units. Financial services are provided by the Bank and other subsidiaries of the
Corporation through offices in 18 U.S. states. The majority of those offices are leased. The Bank’s primary U.S. operations are located in three facilities: a 555,000 square foot leased facility at 801 South Canal Street in Chicago; a
Bank-owned computer data center located in a 405,000 square foot facility at 840 South Canal Street in Chicago; and a Bank-owned supplementary operations/data center space of 65,000 square feet located in the western suburbs of Chicago. A majority
of the Bank’s London-based staff is located at Canary Wharf in London, where 188,000 square feet of office space is leased. Additional support and operations activity originates from Bangalore, where we lease approximately 200,000 square feet
in two facilities. The Bank and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries operate from various other facilities in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Middle East, most of which are leased. In addition to the above-referenced
properties, subsidiaries of the Corporation maintain a number of small operations classified as retirement home/limited access banking locations, back offices, or executive suites.

The Corporation believes that its owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for its business needs. For additional information
relating to properties and lease commitments, refer to Note 7 – Buildings and Equipment and Note 8 – Lease Commitments on pages 82—83 of the Corporation’s Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2009,
which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 3—Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and
threatened legal actions, including, but not limited to, actions brought on behalf of various claimants or classes of claimants, regulatory matters, employment matters, and challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. In
certain of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages or adjustments to recorded tax liabilities are asserted. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly matters that will
be decided by a jury and actions that seek very large damages based on novel and complex damage and liability legal theories or that involve a large number of parties, the Corporation cannot state with confidence the eventual outcome of these
matters or the timing of their ultimate resolution, or estimate the possible loss or range of loss associated with them; however, based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel, management does not believe that judgments or
settlements in excess of amounts already reserved, if any, arising from pending or threatened legal actions, regulatory matters, employment matters, or challenges from tax authorities, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation, although they could have a material adverse effect on operating results for a particular period.



As part of its audit of federal tax returns filed from 1997 – 2004, the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) challenged the Corporation’s tax position with respect to certain structured leasing transactions and proposed to disallow certain tax deductions and assess related interest and penalties. In September 2009, the
Corporation reached a settlement agreement with the IRS with respect to certain of these transactions, resulting in the acceleration of $88.6 million in tax payments to the IRS. The Corporation anticipates that the IRS will continue to disallow
deductions relating to the remaining challenged leases and possibly include other lease transactions with similar characteristics as part of its audit of tax returns filed after 2004. The Corporation believes that these transactions are valid leases
for U.S. tax purposes and that its tax treatment of these transactions is appropriate based on its interpretation of the tax regulations and legal precedents; a court or other judicial authority, however, could disagree. The Corporation believes it
has appropriate reserves to cover its tax liabilities, including liabilities related to structured leasing transactions, and related interest and penalties. The Corporation will continue to vigorously defend its position on the tax treatment of its
structured leasing transactions.

On January 16, 2009 an amended complaint was filed in the putative class action lawsuit
currently pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the Corporation and others. The defendants named in the amended complaint are the Corporation, the Bank, the Northern Trust Employee Benefits
Administrative Committee and its members, the Northern Trust Employee Benefits Investment Committee and its members, and certain other officers, including the present Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and the former Chief Executive Officer
of the Corporation, purportedly on behalf of participants in and beneficiaries of The Northern Trust Company Thrift-Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) whose individual accounts held shares of Corporation common stock at any time from
October 19, 2007 to January 14, 2009. The complaint purports to allege breaches of fiduciary duty in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) related to the Corporation’s stock being offered as an investment
alternative for participants in the Plan and seeks monetary damages. At this early stage of the suit, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of a material adverse outcome or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss.

A number of participants in our securities lending program, which is associated with the Corporation’s asset servicing
business, have commenced either individual lawsuits or putative class actions in which they claim, among other things, that we failed to exercise prudence in the investment management of the collateral received from the borrowers of the securities,
resulting in losses that they seek to recover. The cases assert various contractual, statutory and common law claims, including claims for breach of fiduciary duty under common law and under ERISA.
