FORM 10-K

Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d)

of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934



PART I

Item 1—Business

NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION

Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) is a financial holding company that was originally organized as a bank holding company in Delaware in 1971 to
hold all of the outstanding capital stock, except directors’ qualifying shares, of The Northern Trust Company (Bank). The Corporation conducts business in the United States and around the world through the Bank, four national bank subsidiaries,
a federal savings bank subsidiary, three trust companies and various other U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries. At December 31, 2005, Northern Trust had consolidated total assets of $53.4 billion and stockholders’ equity of $3.6 billion. As of
September 30, 2005, Northern Trust was the third largest bank holding company in Illinois and the 29th largest in the United States based on consolidated total assets on that date.

The Bank is an Illinois banking corporation headquartered in the Chicago financial district and the Corporation’s principal subsidiary. It was
founded by Byron L. Smith in 1889 to provide banking and trust services to the public. Throughout its 116 years, the Bank’s growth has come primarily from internal sources rather than through merger or acquisition. In recent years, the Bank,
like the Corporation generally, has experienced significant growth outside the United States, some of it through a 2005 acquisition. In addition to its U.S. operations, the Bank has a branch and substantial operations in London, a branch in
Singapore and various subsidiaries including an investment management company, a leasing company, a Canadian trust company, a New York Edge Act company, a United Kingdom (U.K.) incorporated bank subsidiary and a Dublin-based fund administration
company. In 2005 the Bank acquired a group of subsidiaries that provide institutional fund administration, custody, banking, trust, and related services. At December 31, 2005, the Bank had consolidated assets of $44.9 billion and common equity
capital of $2.7 billion. At September 30, 2005, the Bank was the second largest bank in Illinois and the 33rd largest in the United States, based on consolidated total assets of approximately $40 billion on that date.

The Corporation expects that, although the operations of other banking and non-banking subsidiaries will continue to be of increasing significance, the
Bank will in the foreseeable future continue to be the major source of the Corporation’s consolidated assets, revenues and net income. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term “Northern Trust” refers to Northern Trust
Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. A complete list of the Corporation’s direct and indirect subsidiaries is filed as Exhibit 21 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated into this Item by reference.

BUSINESS UNITS

Northern Trust,
under Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer William A. Osborn, organizes its services globally around its two client-focused principal business units: Corporate and Institutional Services (C&IS) and Personal Financial Services (PFS).
Two other business units provide services to the two principal business units: Northern Trust Global Investments (NTGI), which provides investment management, and Worldwide Operations and Technology (WWOT), which provides operating and systems
support. For financial management reporting purposes, the operations of NTGI and WWOT are allocated to the two principal business units. Financial information regarding the Corporation’s business units is included in the Corporation’s
Financial Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The following is a brief summary of each business
unit’s activities and the activities of the Corporate Financial Management Group and the Corporate Risk Management Group.

Corporate and
Institutional Services

Headed by Frederick H. Waddell, President—Corporate and Institutional Services, C&IS is a leading
worldwide provider of asset administration, asset management and related services to corporate and public entity retirement funds, foundation and endowment clients, fund managers, insurance companies and government funds. C&IS also offers a full
range of commercial banking services through the Bank, placing special emphasis on developing and supporting institutional relationships in two target markets: large U.S. corporations and financial institutions (both U.S. and non-U.S.). Asset
administration, asset management and related services encompass a full range of state-of-the-art capabilities including: worldwide master trust, asset servicing, fund administration, settlement and reporting; cash management; and investment risk and
performance analytical services. Such services with respect to securities traded in non-U.S. markets are provided primarily through the Bank’s London Branch. Non-U.S. client relationships are managed principally through the Bank’s London
and Singapore Branches and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s non-U.S. subsidiaries. C&IS added to its global sales and relationship management facilities a representative office in Beijing, China in 2005. Trust and



asset servicing relationships managed by C&IS often include investment management, securities lending, transition
management and commission recapture services provided through NTGI. C&IS also provides related foreign exchange services in Chicago, London, Singapore and Guernsey. At December 31, 2005, total C&IS assets under custody were $2.7
trillion and $501 billion were managed.

On March 31, 2005, Northern Trust completed its acquisition of the Financial Services Group
Limited (FSG) from Baring Asset Management Holdings Limited. The purchase of FSG brought to C&IS expanded capabilities in institutional fund administration, custody, trust and related services as well as new capabilities in hedge fund and
private equity administration. The acquisition of FSG also gave C&IS significant technical expertise and talent in administering these asset classes.

Personal Financial Services

Headed by Sherry S. Barrat and William L. Morrison, Presidents—Personal Financial
Services, PFS provides personal trust, custody and investment management services; individual retirement accounts; guardianship and estate administration; qualified retirement plans; banking (including private banking); personal lending; and
residential real estate mortgage lending. PFS focuses on high net worth individuals, business owners, executives, retirees and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. PFS also includes the Wealth Management Group, which provides
customized products and services to meet the complex financial needs of families and individuals in the United States and throughout the world with assets typically exceeding $75 million.

PFS is one of the largest providers of personal trust services in the United States, with $226 billion in assets under custody and $117 billion in assets
under management at December 31, 2005. PFS services are delivered through the Bank and four national bank subsidiaries, a federal savings bank subsidiary, and a limited purpose trust company in Delaware that opened in 2005. The PFS network
includes over 80 offices in 18 U.S. states as well as offices in the U.K. The Corporation expects to complete in 2006 a charter consolidation process that will result in its four national bank subsidiaries becoming a single national bank.

In 2005, PFS opened permanent offices in Boston, Massachusetts and Minneapolis, Minnesota. The FSG acquisition also brought to PFS
additional capabilities to service high net worth individuals and families centered in the U.K. and Europe.

Northern Trust Global Investments

Headed by Terence J. Toth, President—Northern Trust Global Investments, NTGI, through various subsidiaries of the Corporation,
provides a broad range of investment management and related services and other products to U.S. and non-U.S. clients of C&IS and PFS. Clients include institutional and individual separately managed accounts, bank common and collective funds,
registered investment companies, non-U.S. collective investment funds and unregistered private investment funds. NTGI offers both active and passive equity and fixed income portfolio management, as well as alternative asset classes (such as private
equity and hedge funds of funds) and traditional multi-manager products and services. NTGI’s activities also encompass brokerage, securities lending, transition management and related services. NTGI’s business operates internationally
through subsidiaries, joint ventures, alliances and distribution arrangements.

Worldwide Operations and Technology

Headed by Timothy J. Theriault, President—Worldwide Operations and Technology, WWOT supports all of Northern Trust’s business activities,
including the processing and product management activities of C&IS, PFS and NTGI. These activities are conducted principally in the operations and technology centers in Chicago and London. In 2005, Northern Trust began development of a leased
facility in Bangalore, India that will supplement its Chicago and London operations.

Corporate Financial Management Group

Headed by Steven L. Fradkin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the Corporate Financial Management Group includes the Treasury,
Corporate Controller, Corporate Treasurer, Corporate Development, Investor Relations and Strategic Sourcing functions. The Group is responsible for Northern Trust’s accounting and financial infrastructure and for managing the Corporation’s
financial position.

Corporate Risk Management Group

Headed by Jana R. Schreuder, Executive Vice President, the Corporate Risk Management Group includes the Credit Policy and Corporate Risk Management functions. The Credit Policy function is described in the section of
the Financial Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2005 referenced on pages 20-21. The Corporate Risk Management Group monitors, measures and facilitates the management of risks across the businesses of the Corporation
and its subsidiaries. Corporate Risk Management also includes the Economic Research function.



GOVERNMENT POLICIES

The earnings of Northern Trust are affected by numerous external influences. Chief among these are general economic conditions, both domestic and international, and actions that the United States and foreign
governments and their central banks take in managing their economies. These general conditions affect all of the Northern Trust’s businesses, as well as the quality, value and profitability of their loan and investment portfolios.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is an important regulator of U.S. economic conditions and has the general objective of promoting
orderly economic growth in the United States. Implementation of this objective is accomplished by its open market operations in United States Government securities, its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from Federal
Reserve Banks and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits. The policies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board may strongly influence interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their
savings and time deposits and other purchased funds. Fiscal policies in the United States and abroad also affect the composition and use of Northern Trust’s resources.

COMPETITION

The businesses in which Northern Trust operates are very
competitive. Competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial services organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and global markets in which Northern Trust conducts operations.

Northern Trust’s principal business strategy is to provide quality financial services to targeted market segments in which it believes it has a
competitive advantage and favorable growth prospects. As part of this strategy, Northern Trust seeks to deliver a level of service to its clients that distinguishes it from its competitors. In addition, Northern Trust emphasizes the development and
growth of recurring sources of fee-based income and is one of a select group of major bank holding companies in the United States that generates more revenues from fee-based services than from net interest income. Northern Trust seeks to develop and
expand its recurring fee-based revenue by identifying selected markets with good growth characteristics and providing a high level of individualized service to its clients in those markets. Northern Trust also seeks to preserve its asset quality
through established credit review procedures and to maintain a conservative balance sheet. Finally, Northern Trust seeks to operate with a strong management team that includes senior officers having broad experience and long tenure.

Commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions actively compete for deposits, and money market funds and investment
banking firms offer deposit-like services. These institutions, as well as consumer and commercial finance companies, national retail chains, factors, insurance companies and pension trusts, are important competitors for various types of loans.
Issuers of commercial paper compete actively for funds and reduce demand for bank loans. For personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling services, trust companies, investment banking firms, insurance companies, investment
counseling firms, and others offer active competition. A wide variety of U.S. and non-U.S. companies compete for settlement and other services.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

Financial Holding Company Regulation

Under U.S. law, the Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) as
amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). Consequently, the Corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision, examination and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. The BHCA and other federal laws
subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws
and regulations. Supervision and regulation of bank holding companies, financial holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries, the deposit insurance funds
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of stockholders or creditors.

Under the BHCA, bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking. As a financial holding company, the Corporation is permitted to
engage in other activities that the Federal Reserve Board, working with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do
not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities. Activities defined to be financial in nature include providing
financial or investment advice; securities underwriting and dealing; insurance underwriting; and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies, subject to significant limitations. They also include activities previously
determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to



banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The Corporation may not, however, directly
or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

In order to maintain the Corporation’s status as a financial holding company, each of the Corporation’s insured depository institution
subsidiaries must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable regulations, and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act.
Failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met, that the Corporation could not undertake new activities, make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies, or
continue certain activities.

Subsidiary Regulation

The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, its deposits are insured by the FDIC, and it is subject to regulation by both these entities, as well as by the Division of Banking of the Illinois Department of
Financial and Professional Regulation. The Bank is registered as a government securities dealer in accordance with the Government Securities Act of 1986. As a government securities dealer, its activities are subject to the rules and regulations of
the Department of the Treasury. The Bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the Federal Reserve and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve in this area. In addition, the Corporation, the Bank and the
Corporation’s New York trust company subsidiary are subject to regulation by the Banking Department of the State of New York.

The
Corporation’s national bank subsidiaries are members of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC and are subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Northern Trust Bank, FSB is a federal savings bank that is not
a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision and the FDIC.

The
Corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination by the Federal Reserve. Its broker-dealer subsidiary is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is a member of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies. Several subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Other subsidiaries are regulated by the Connecticut Department of Banking and the Office of the State Bank Commissioner in Delaware. Two families of mutual funds for which the Bank acts as investment adviser and one
registered closed-end hedge fund of funds for which another subsidiary serves as investment adviser are subject to regulation by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Functional Regulation

Enacted in late 1999, the GLBA established a system of federal and state
regulation based on functional regulation, meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity. Banking is
supervised by federal and state banking regulators, insurance by state insurance regulators and securities activities by the SEC and state securities regulators.

A significant component of the functional regulation provided in the GLBA relates to the application of federal securities laws and SEC oversight of some bank securities activities previously exempt from broker-dealer
regulation. Among other things, the GLBA amended the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the Exchange Act to remove the blanket exemption for banks. The SEC has several times extended the blanket exemption for broker
activities by order and requested comments on proposed implementing regulations. A prior extension of the blanket exemption for dealer activities has expired. Without these blanket exemptions, banks may conduct securities activities without
broker-dealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activity-based exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities. Securities activities
outside these exemptions, as a practical matter, need to be conducted by a registered broker-dealer affiliate. The GLBA also amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of
the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds. The Corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of GLBA and the regulations adopted under them to date. Additional SEC rulemaking relating
to the GLBA’s broker exemption discussed above could require further action.

Non-U.S. Regulation

The increasingly important activities of the Corporation’s subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by a number of non-U.S.
regulatory agencies. Subsidiaries conducting investment management, banking and asset-servicing businesses in the United Kingdom, for example, are authorized to do so pursuant to the UK Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 or are otherwise
subject to regulation under it by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The FSA exercises broad supervisory and



disciplinary powers that include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke authorization to conduct a regulated
business upon breach of the relevant regulations, the suspension of registered employees and censures and fines for both regulated businesses and their regulated employees. The non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Corporation and branches of the Bank
outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate.

Cross-Guarantees Under the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), when two or more insured depository institutions are
under common control, each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred, or expected to be incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the default of any of the others. Each also may be liable for any assistance the FDIC
provides to the other institutions. “Default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution. Thus, any of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the FDIC if the FDIC were to suffer a loss in
connection with any of the Corporation’s other banking subsidiaries. This cross-guarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities, secured obligations, any other
general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors, other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution (with certain exceptions). Although neither the Corporation nor any of
its nonbanking subsidiaries may be assessed for such loss under the FDIA, the Corporation has agreed to indemnify each of its banking subsidiaries, other than the Bank, for any payments a banking subsidiary may be liable to pay to the FDIC pursuant
to these provisions of the FDIA.

Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial
strength to its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve Board at times when, absent this Federal Reserve policy, it would not otherwise be provided. The Corporation has source
of strength agreements in place with its existing subsidiaries evidencing its commitment to provide such support as needed. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository institution subsidiaries are subordinate in
right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks.

Payment of Dividends

The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The principal source of funds for the Corporation is dividends from the
Bank. As a result, the Corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations. Dividend payments from the
Bank are subject to Illinois law and to regulatory limitations, generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings, imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is
also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability, financial condition or other cash flow requirements.

The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies. The policy statement provides that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company should not maintain a
rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs,
asset quality and overall financial condition. Accordingly, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health, such as by
borrowing.

Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to the Corporation without
regulatory approval. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would
exceed the total of its retained net income (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its
undivided profits, as defined, without regulatory and shareholder approval.

The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any
dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized. In addition, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The payment of dividends could,
depending on the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

Capital Adequacy Requirements

The Federal Reserve Board has established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies. The minimum ratio of total capital to
risk-weighted assets (which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain off-balance



sheet items such as standby letters of credit) is eight percent. At least half of the total capital must be composed of
common stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings), qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (and, for bank holding companies only, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock), and minority interests
in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets, among other items (“tier 1 Capital”). The remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt,
other perpetual preferred stock, hybrid capital instruments, mandatory convertible debt securities that meet certain requirements, as well as a limited amount of reserves for loan losses (“tier 2 Capital”). The Federal Reserve Board also
has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies, requiring tier 1 Capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets.

The federal banking regulators have also established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines that insured banks and thrifts are required to meet. These regulations are generally similar to those established by the
Federal Reserve Board for bank holding companies. The risk-based and leverage capital ratios for the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries, together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as
“well-capitalized,” are provided in the following chart.

The federal bank regulatory agencies’ risk-based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory
ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria, assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating. Banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well
above the minimum ratios. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve Board guidelines also provide that
banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. In addition, the
regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that concentration of credit risk, interest rate risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities, as well as an institution’s ability to manage these risks, are important factors to
be taken into account by regulatory agencies in assessing an organization’s overall capital adequacy. The agencies also have adopted an adjustment to the risk-based capital calculations to cover market risk in trading accounts of certain
institutions. The risk-based capital regulations also require banking institutions to effectively measure and monitor their interest rate risk and to maintain adequate capital for that risk.

In June 2004, the central bank governors and heads of bank supervision of the G10 countries endorsed a new framework for risk-based capital adequacy,
sometimes referred to as Basel II, which had been developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The Basel II framework forms the basis upon which the U.S. regulatory authorities are developing proposed revisions to existing capital
adequacy regulations and standards. In August 2003, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies published for notice and comment an advance notice of proposed rulemaking discussing possible revisions to risk-based capital adequacy regulations relating to an
earlier version of Basel II. The latest agreed-upon version of the framework was released by the Basel Committee in November 2005. The agencies anticipate that the Basel II framework will become fully effective in the United States in January 2009,
with transitional arrangements in place for at least the following three years.

The agencies expect that only a small number of large,
internationally active U.S. banking organizations will be required to use the Basel II framework, and that these institutions (“mandatory banking organizations”) will be permitted to use only the most



advanced approaches under Basel II for determining their risk-based capital requirements. Other U.S. banking
organizations that qualify may elect to use the most advanced approaches under Basel II. All other U.S. banking organizations will remain subject to the existing risk-based capital regulations. In October, 2005 the U.S. agencies issued an advance
notice of proposed rule-making with respect to possible changes in the existing risk-based capital regulations, for banking organizations that do not use Basel II approaches. The agencies have not proposed to change the leverage ratio requirement,
which is not risk-based, for banking organizations not using the Basel II approaches, and have indicated that it will continue to apply to organizations that are subject to Basel II.

The Corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the advanced approaches of the Basel II framework. The Corporation is monitoring the
status and progress of the revisions to the risk-based capital adequacy guidelines for U.S. banking organizations and evaluating the potential impact on its financial condition and results of operations.

Although the U.S. rules related to Basel II have not been finalized, under the current guidance Northern Trust would be a mandatory banking organization.
In addition, the Corporation is addressing issues related to timing differences between the U.S. implementation timeline and timelines in other jurisdictions, to ensure that the Corporation complies with regulatory requirements and expectations in
all countries in which it operates.

Based on the proposed rules, preliminary analysis of the impact of the Basel II risk-based capital
framework suggests that the use of the advanced approaches of the Basel II framework would have a positive impact on the Corporation’s Tier I and Total risk-based capital ratios. These results are based on preliminary data and could change
under the final rules. In addition, the implementation process has not reached the stage where it would be appropriate for the Corporation to seek confirmation from U.S. regulatory agencies that Northern Trust’s current approach for measurement
of regulatory risk-based capital would comply with either the current proposal or future regulatory rules related to the Basel II risk-based capital framework.

Prompt Corrective Action

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, the federal banking
agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized depository institutions. Depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,”
“undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized,” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls. Under
certain circumstances, a well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. A depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital
distributions (including paying dividends) or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a
waiver from the FDIC, and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits.

The banking regulatory agencies are permitted or, in certain cases, required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of
the three undercapitalized categories. Depending on the level of an institution’s capital, the agency’s corrective powers include, among other things:

•

prohibiting the payment of principal and interest on subordinated debt;

•

prohibiting the holding company from making distributions without prior regulatory approval;

•

placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities;

•

placing additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates;

•

restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits;

•

prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; and

•

in the most severe cases, appointing a conservator or receiver for the institution.

A banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan, and such a plan will not be accepted unless, among other things, the banking institution’s holding company
guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy. Failure to



meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies,
including termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and restrictions on certain business activities. As of December 31, 2005, the Corporation and all of its banking subsidiaries exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as
“well capitalized.”

Enforcement Powers of the Federal Banking Agencies

The federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to issue cease and desist orders, impose substantial fines and other civil
and criminal penalties, terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries, as well as
officers, directors and other institution-affiliated parties of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties. In addition to the grounds discussed under “Prompt Corrective Action,” the
appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the FDIC as conservator or receiver for a banking institution (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist, including, without
limitation, the fact that the banking institution:

•

is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized;

•

fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so;

•

fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan; or

•

materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan.

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders

The Corporation’s bank subsidiaries are subject to
restrictions under federal law, including Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Board, which limit certain transactions with the Corporation, including loans, other extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases. Such transactions by a banking
subsidiary with any one affiliate are limited in amount to 10 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus and, with all affiliates together, to an aggregate of 20 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus. Furthermore, such loans and
extensions of credit, as well as certain other transactions, are required to be secured in specified amounts. These and certain other transactions, including any payment of money to the Corporation, must be on terms and conditions that are, or in
good faith would be, offered to nonaffiliated companies.

The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal
stockholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as “insiders”) contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O apply to all federally insured institutions. These restrictions include limits on loans to one
borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests. These loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and
surplus, and the FDIC may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions. Regulation O institutions are not subject to the prohibitions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 on certain loans to insiders.

Anti-Terrorism Legislation

The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 includes the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, which contains anti-money
laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions. These are in addition to requirements contained in the Bank Secrecy Act. The Act requires U.S. financial institutions to adopt
policies and procedures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing and grants the Secretary of the Treasury and bank regulatory agencies broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial
institutions’ operations as well as sanctions for failure to meet regulatory requirements. The Corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with the Act and the related regulations.

Deposit Insurance

Under the FDIC’s risk-based
insurance assessment system, each insured bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. Each insured bank is placed in one of nine risk categories based on its level of capital and other relevant information and its
insurance assessment rate is then determined by the FDIC. There is currently a 27 basis point spread between the highest and lowest assessment rates, so that banks classified as strongest by the FDIC are subject in 2006 to no insurance assessment,
and banks classified as weakest by the FDIC are subject to an insurance assessment rate of .27%. In addition to its insurance assessment, each insured bank is subject in 2006 to quarterly debt service assessments in connection with bonds issued by a
government corporation that financed the federal savings and loans bailout. The first quarter 2006 debt service assessment is .0132%.



Control Acquisitions

The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been notified and has not objected to the
transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve Board, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange
Act, such as the Corporation, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of the Corporation.

In addition, any company is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding common stock of the
Corporation, or otherwise obtaining control or a “controlling influence” over the Corporation or its banking subsidiaries.

Interstate Banking
and Branching

The Riegle-Neal Act enacted in 1994 permits an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company, with
Federal Reserve Board approval, to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding company’s home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law. In addition, national banks and state
banks with different home states are permitted to merge across state lines, with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, unless the home state of a participating banking institution has passed legislation prior to that date that
expressly prohibits interstate mergers. De novo interstate branching is permitted if the laws of the host state so authorize. Thrift institutions (like Northern Trust Bank, FSB) may freely engage in de novo branching on an interstate basis.
Moreover, national banks, like many of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries, may provide trust services in any state to the same extent as a trust company chartered by that state.

Community Reinvestment Act

The Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to the Community
Reinvestment Act (CRA). The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound
operations of the banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications and applications to acquire
the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 requires federal banking agencies to make public a rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. In the case of a
bank holding company, the CRA performance record of its bank subsidiaries is reviewed by federal banking agencies in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or thrift or to merge
with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction. Each of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries, including the Bank, received at least a satisfactory CRA rating from its regulator
in its most recent CRA examination.

Privacy and Security

The GLBA also establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by, among other provisions, requiring banks to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth
certain rules with respect to the disclosure to third parties of consumer information. The Corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to the GLBA. Regulations adopted under the GLBA set standards for protecting the
security, confidentiality and integrity of customer information, and require notice to regulators, and in some cases, to customers, in the event of security breaches. A number of states have adopted their own statutes requiring notification of
security breaches. In addition, the GLBA requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups that relate to the CRA, and contains various other provisions designed to improve the delivery of financial services to consumers while
maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial services industry.

Consumer Laws and Regulations

In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above, the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to certain consumer laws and
regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer
Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure
requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such customers. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations
could lead to substantial penalties, operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution.



Future Legislation

Various legislation is from time to time introduced in Congress and state legislatures with respect to the regulation of financial institutions. Such legislation may change the banking statutes and the operating
environment of the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. The Corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential legislation, or implementing regulations, if enacted, would have upon the
financial condition or results of operations of the Corporation or its banking subsidiaries.

The following table sets forth certain information
with regard to each executive officer of the Corporation.

Item 1A—Risk Factors

From an investor’s standpoint, public companies in general and financial
institutions in particular share many of the same risks. However, each company’s unique combination of strategies, markets served, product and service offerings, processes and systems, and other internal and external factors cause it to have
its own set of principal risks. Following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in Northern Trust’s business. We manage these risks through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls.

Economic Risks

Northern Trust carries
on a global business. Changes in the world economy, or in the economies of the U.S. or other countries or regions, can affect our results. For example, a downturn in the U.S. economy can affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans, causing credit
quality to deteriorate. Falling equity markets generally affect Northern Trust earnings negatively, since a



significant part of the fees we earn is based on asset values. The direction and level of interest rates also are
important factors since falling rates or rates that remain very low can reduce or reduce growth in net interest income levels. Economic conditions also affect wealth creation, investment and savings patterns, all of which may impact Northern
Trust’s business. Conditions in particular markets, including matters such as currency volatility and the demand for borrowed securities, can affect Northern Trust’s earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities
lending. In addition, transaction volumes can impact Northern Trust’s earnings and may vary with economic conditions.

Operating Risks

In our asset servicing, investment management and other business activities, Northern Trust effects or processes transactions for
clients that involve very large amounts of money. Human errors or omissions, systems defects, systems interruptions and breakdowns in processes or internal controls can result in significant exposure. External events, including natural disasters,
epidemics, or terrorist events, can similarly impact operations, creating exposure.

Investment Performance and Fiduciary Risks

Revenues from our investment management and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings. Generating returns that satisfy clients in a
variety of asset classes is important to maintaining existing business and attracting new business. Administering or managing assets in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is also important to client satisfaction,
and failure to do so can generate liability.

Regulation Risks

Virtually every aspect of Northern Trust’s business around the world is regulated, generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions. Regulatory violations
could generate penalties, result in limitations on our ability to conduct business or restrict our ability to expand. Changes in regulation also can impose costs or otherwise affect our ability to compete successfully. Evolving regulations, such as
the new Basel II capital regime and anti-money laundering regulations, can require significant effort on our part to ensure compliance. New or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on
the financial institutions industry, including Northern Trust.

Litigation Risks

Our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us, claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise breached a duty
owed to them. Our trust and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk. Cases of this kind can involve substantial claims and be expensive to defend. We estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims
by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations. This process is subject to the risk that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the
facts, and to the risk that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case. Developments in a particular case may also impact services that we provide to others.

Strategic Risks

We have grown through a combination
of internal expansion and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities, and we intend to continue to do so. Failure to integrate a substantial acquisition would have an adverse effect on our business, as would the failure to execute
successfully any significant internal expansion. Growth also depends upon successful, consistent execution of our business strategies in both PFS and C&IS, and a failure to do so could negatively impact growth.

We do business in competitive markets that require consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation. This investment is either to
generate new products or more effective service delivery that will help us compete successfully for new clients or additional business from existing clients. Innovation, as a part of our business strategy, also produces efficiencies in operations
that will help us reduce and control costs, including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets. Falling behind our competition in any of these areas could adversely affect our
business opportunities and growth.

Reputation Risks

An important reason that clients bring their business to Northern Trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics, performance, accuracy, and compliance. Many of the risks described above
would, if our plans and processes for



controlling or mitigating them are not successful, damage our reputation for delivering the expected service, and
consequently undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them. Damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of counterparties, rating agencies, and stockholders in Northern Trust, and ultimately affect our
ability to manage our balance sheet or effect transactions.

Many of the risks described above are discussed in more detail in the sections
of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Risk Management,” “Market Risk Management” and “Operational Risk Management” in the 2005 Financial
Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 20 - 30), in the section of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2005 Financial Annual Report to Stockholders captioned “Note 25, Contingent Liabilities” (pages 62 –
63), and in the sections of “Item 1 – Business” of the 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K captioned “Government Policies,” “Competition” and “Regulation and Supervision” (pages 6 - 13).
