PART I

Item 1—Business

NORTHERN TRUST
CORPORATION

Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) is a financial holding company that is a leading provider of asset
servicing, fund administration, asset management, fiduciary and banking solutions for corporations, institutions, families and individuals worldwide. The Corporation conducts business through various U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, including The
Northern Trust Company (Bank). The Corporation was originally formed as a holding company for the Bank in 1971. The Corporation has 78 offices in 18 U.S. states and 16 international locations outside the U.S. At December 31, 2010, the
Corporation had consolidated total assets of $83.8 billion and stockholders’ equity of $6.8 billion.

The Bank is an
Illinois banking corporation headquartered in the Chicago financial district and the Corporation’s principal subsidiary. Founded in 1889, the Bank conducts its business through its U.S. operations and its various U.S. and non-U.S. branches and
subsidiaries. At December 31, 2010, the Bank had consolidated assets of $70.4 billion and common equity capital of $5.4 billion.

The Corporation expects that, although the operations of other banking and non-banking subsidiaries will continue to be of increasing significance, the Bank will in the foreseeable future continue to be
the major source of the Corporation’s consolidated assets, revenues, and net income. Except where the context otherwise requires, the term “Northern Trust” refers to Northern Trust Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis. A complete list of the Corporation’s direct and indirect subsidiaries is filed as Exhibit 21 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated into this Item by reference.

BUSINESS UNITS

Under the leadership of Frederick H. Waddell, the Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, Northern Trust organizes its services globally around its two
client-focused principal business units: Corporate and Institutional Services (C&IS) and Personal Financial Services (PFS). Two other business units provide services to the two principal business units: Northern Trust Global Investments (NTGI),
which provides investment management, and Operations and Technology (O&T), which provides operating and systems support.

Financial information regarding the Corporation and its business units is included in the Corporation’s Annual Report to
Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2010. In particular, for a discussion of significant developments in the business of the Corporation, and the impact on the financial results of the Corporation and its business units for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2010, you are urged to review the section entitled “Consolidated Results of Operations” on pages 24 through 32 of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of
the Corporation’s Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference.

The following is a brief summary of each business unit’s activities and the activities of the Corporate Financial Management Group and the Corporate Risk Management Group.

Corporate and Institutional Services

C&IS is a leading global provider of asset servicing, asset management, securities lending, brokerage, banking and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments,
fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth and government funds. Asset servicing, asset management, and related services encompass a full range of industry leading capabilities including but not limited to: global master trust and
custody, trade settlement, and reporting; fund administration; cash management; investment risk and performance analytical services; and investment operations outsourcing. Client relationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the
Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support from international locations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific region. Asset servicing relationships managed by C&IS often include investment management,
transition management, and commission recapture services provided through NTGI. C&IS also provides related foreign exchange services from offices located in the U.S., U.K., and Singapore. At December 31, 2010, total C&IS assets under
custody were $3.7 trillion and assets under management were $489.2 billion.



Personal Financial Services

PFS provides personal trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services; financial consulting; guardianship and estate administration; brokerage services; and private and business banking.
PFS focuses on high net worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. PFS also includes the Wealth Management Group, which provides customized
products and services to meet the complex financial needs of individuals and family offices in the United States and throughout the world with assets typically exceeding $200 million.

PFS is one of the largest providers of personal trust services in the United States, with $370.2 billion in assets under custody and
$154.4 billion in assets under management at December 31, 2010. PFS services are delivered through 78 offices in 18 U.S. states as well as offices in London and Guernsey.

Northern Trust Global Investments

NTGI, through various subsidiaries of
the Corporation, provides a broad range of investment management and related services and other products to U.S. and non-U.S. clients, including clients of C&IS and PFS. Clients include institutional and individual separately managed accounts,
bank common and collective funds, registered investment companies, non-U.S. collective investment funds and unregistered private investment funds. NTGI offers both active and passive equity and fixed income portfolio management, as well as
alternative asset classes (such as private equity and hedge funds of funds) and multi-manager products and advisory services. NTGI’s activities also include transition management, overlay services, and other risk management services.
NTGI’s business operates internationally through subsidiaries, joint ventures, alliances, and distribution arrangements.

Operations
and Technology

O&T supports all of Northern Trust’s business activities, including the processing and product
management activities of C&IS, PFS, and NTGI. These activities are conducted principally in the operations and technology centers in Chicago, London, and Bangalore.

Corporate Financial Management Group

The Corporate Financial Management
Group includes the Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Treasurer, and Investor Relations functions. The Group is responsible for Northern Trust’s accounting and financial infrastructure and for managing the Corporation’s financial
position.

Corporate Risk Management Group

The Corporate Risk Management Group includes the Credit Policy and other Corporate Risk Management functions. The Credit Policy function is described in the “Loans and Other Extensions of
Credit” section of the Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2010 on pages 53-58. The Corporate Risk Management Group monitors, measures, and facilitates the management of risks across the businesses of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES

The earnings of Northern Trust are affected by numerous external influences. Chief among these are general economic conditions, both
domestic and international, and actions that governments and their central banks take in managing their economies. These general conditions affect all of Northern Trust’s businesses, as well as the quality, value, and profitability of their
loan and investment portfolios.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) is an important
regulator of U.S. economic conditions and has the general objective of promoting orderly economic growth in the United States. Implementation of this objective is accomplished by the Federal Reserve Board’s open market operations in United
States Government securities, its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from Federal Reserve Banks and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits. The policies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board may strongly
influence interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds. Fiscal policies in the United States and abroad also affect the composition and use of
Northern Trust’s resources.



COMPETITION

The businesses in which Northern Trust operates are very competitive. Competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial services organizations, whose products and services span the
local, national, and global markets in which Northern Trust conducts operations.

Northern Trust’s principal business
strategy is to provide quality financial services to targeted market segments in which it believes it has a competitive advantage and favorable growth prospects. As part of this strategy, Northern Trust seeks to deliver a level of service to its
clients that distinguishes it from its competitors. In addition, Northern Trust emphasizes the development and growth of recurring sources of fee-based income and is one of a select group of major bank holding companies in the United States that
generates more revenues from fee-based services than from net interest income. Northern Trust seeks to develop and expand its recurring fee-based revenue by identifying selected markets with good growth characteristics and providing a high level of
individualized service to its clients in those markets. Northern Trust also seeks to preserve its asset quality through established credit review procedures and to maintain a conservative balance sheet. Finally, Northern Trust seeks to operate with
a strong management team that includes senior officers having broad experience and long tenures.

Commercial banks, savings
banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions actively compete for deposits, and money market funds and investment banking firms offer deposit-like services. These institutions, as well as consumer and commercial finance companies,
national retail chains, factors, insurance companies, and pension trusts, are important competitors for various types of loans. Issuers of commercial paper compete actively for funds and reduce demand for bank loans. For personal and corporate trust
services and investment counseling services, trust companies, investment banking firms, insurance companies, investment counseling firms, and others offer active competition.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

Financial Holding Company Regulation

Under U.S. law, the Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956 (BHCA), as amended. Consequently, the Corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision, examination, and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. The BHCA and other federal laws subject
bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and
regulations. Supervision and regulation of bank holding companies, financial holding companies, and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries, the deposit insurance fund of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of stockholders or other creditors.

Under the BHCA, bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking. As a financial holding
company, the Corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the Federal Reserve Board, working with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or
complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities. Activities defined
to be financial in nature include: providing financial or investment advice; securities underwriting and dealing; insurance underwriting; and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies, subject to significant
limitations. They also include activities previously determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The Corporation may not, however, directly or
indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

In order to maintain the Corporation’s status as a financial holding company, each of the Corporation’s insured depository
institution subsidiaries must remain “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable regulations, and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the Community
Reinvestment Act (CRA). Failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met, that the Corporation could not undertake new activities, make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank
holding companies, or continue certain activities.



Subsidiary Regulation

The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, its deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum authorized limit, and it is subject to regulation by both these entities, as well as by the
Division of Banking of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. The Bank is registered as a government securities dealer in accordance with the Government Securities Act of 1986. As a government securities dealer, its
activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of the Treasury. The Bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the Federal Reserve Board and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board
in this area. In addition, the Corporation, the Bank and the Corporation’s New York trust company subsidiary are subject to regulation by the Banking Department of the State of New York.

The Corporation’s national bank subsidiary is a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to regulation by the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), with deposits insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and FDIC regulations. Northern Trust Bank, FSB, a subsidiary of the Corporation, is a federal savings bank that is
not a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTC) and the FDIC, with its deposits insured by the FDIC. Recent changes in the law will, in the future, shift principal regulatory
jurisdiction over Northern Trust Bank, FSB, from the OTC to the OCC.

The Corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all
subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Its broker-dealer subsidiary is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, subject to the rules and regulations of
both of these bodies. Several subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Other subsidiaries are regulated by
the Connecticut Department of Banking and the Office of the State Bank Commissioner in Delaware. Two families of mutual funds for which the Bank acts as investment adviser and one registered closed-end hedge fund of funds for which another
subsidiary serves as investment adviser are subject to regulation by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Functional
Regulation

Federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on
functional regulation, meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity. Banking is supervised by federal
and state banking regulators, insurance by state insurance regulators, and securities activities by the SEC and state securities regulators.

A significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and SEC oversight of some bank securities activities. Generally, banks may conduct securities
activities without broker-dealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activity-based exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities.
Securities activities outside these exemptions, as a practical matter, need to be conducted by a registered broker-dealer affiliate. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the
bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds. The Corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of federal law.

Non-U.S. Regulation

The increasingly important activities of the
Corporation’s subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by a number of non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Subsidiaries conducting banking, fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the United Kingdom, for example,
are authorized to do so pursuant to the UK Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 or are otherwise subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The FSA exercises broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the
power to temporarily or permanently revoke authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations, suspend registered employees, and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees.
The non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Corporation and branches of the Bank outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Additionally, the Corporation’s subsidiary banks
located outside the U.S. are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of December 31, 2010, each of the Corporation’s non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified
minimum requirements.



The Dodd-Frank Act

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act will have a broad impact on the financial services industry
and will impose significant new regulatory and compliance requirements, including the designation of certain financial companies as systemically significant, the imposition of increased capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, and numerous
other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness within, the financial services sector. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk
oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council), the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC, and the FDIC.

The following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that are most relevant to the Corporation and
its banking subsidiaries.

•

Heightened Prudential Requirements

. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes heightened prudential requirements on U.S. bank holding companies with at
least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, including the Corporation, and on large financial companies and nonbank financial companies that the Council determines should be subject to Federal Reserve Board supervision. The heightened prudential
standards include more stringent risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and risk-management requirements than those applied to other bank holding companies or financial companies. In addition, covered companies, including the Corporation, must
prepare and file resolution plans (so-called “living wills”) and credit exposure reports and limit their aggregate credit exposures (broadly defined) to any unaffiliated company to 25 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the covered
company. The Federal Reserve Board and the Council will also have the discretion to require these companies to limit their short-term debt, to issue contingent capital instruments, and to provide enhanced public disclosures. These companies will
also be subject to periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy in adverse economic conditions. Heightened prudential standards may be applied on a graduated basis using the factors considered by the Council for systemic determinations. These
requirements, depending upon how they are implemented, could increase capital requirements and compliance costs, and could adversely affect certain activities, of covered companies, including the Corporation.

•

Mortgage Loan Origination and Risk Retention

. The Dodd-Frank Act contains additional regulatory requirements that may affect the
Corporation’s subsidiaries operations and result in increased compliance costs. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks and thrifts, in an effort to require steps to
verify a borrower’s ability to repay.

•

Proprietary Trading and Certain Relationships with Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds

. The Dodd-Frank Act adopts the so-called
“Volcker Rule” which, subject to a transition period and certain exceptions, prohibits a banking entity from engaging in “proprietary trading,” which is defined as engaging as principal for the “trading account” of the
banking entity in securities or other instruments as determined by federal regulators. Certain forms of proprietary trading may qualify as “permitted activities,” and thus not be subject to the ban on proprietary trading, such as
“market-making-related activities”, “risk-mitigating hedging activities”, and trading in U.S. government or agency obligations, certain other U.S., state or municipal obligations, and the obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or
Ginnie Mae. Additionally, subject to a transition period and certain exceptions, the rule restricts a banking entity from sponsoring or investing in a hedge fund or private equity fund. While a banking entity may “organize and offer” a
hedge fund or private equity fund if certain conditions are met, it may not acquire or retain an equity partnership or other ownership interest in a fund except for certain limited investments. A banking entity that sponsors or invests in a hedge
fund or private equity fund is also restricted from providing credit to the fund. After the transition period, the Volcker Rule prohibitions and restrictions will apply to banking entities, including the Corporation, the Bank and their affiliates,
unless an exception applies. The scope of the Volcker Rule will be more fully defined and implemented over a multiple year period through rulemakings by several federal agencies. As such, the Corporation cannot fully assess the impact of the Volcker
Rule on its business until final rules and regulations are adopted.

•

Swaps and Derivatives

. The Dodd-Frank Act requires new regulations for the over-the-counter derivatives market, including requirements
for clearing, exchange trading, capital, margin, and reporting. In addition, certain swaps and derivatives activities are required to be “pushed out” of insured depository institutions and conducted in non-bank affiliates. Rulemaking will
also require certain persons to register as a “major swap participant” or a “swap



dealer”, and will further clarify what swaps are required to be centrally cleared and settled. Rules will also be issued to enhance the oversight of payment, clearing and settlement
entities.

•

Expanded FDIC Resolution Authority

. While insured depository institutions have long been subject to the FDIC’s resolution process,
the Dodd-Frank Act creates a new mechanism for the FDIC to conduct the orderly liquidation of certain “covered financial companies,” including bank holding companies and systemically significant non-bank financial companies. Upon certain
findings being made, the FDIC may be appointed receiver for a covered financial company, and would be tasked to conduct an orderly liquidation of the entity. The FDIC liquidation process is modeled on the existing Federal Deposit Insurance Act
(FDIA) bank resolution regulations, and generally gives the FDIC more discretion than in the traditional non-bank bankruptcy context.

•

Consumer Financial Protection

. The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within the
Federal Reserve System. The CFPB is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPB
has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing financial products and services offered to consumers. For banking organizations with assets of $10 billion or more, the CFPB has exclusive rule making and examination, and primary
enforcement, authority under federal consumer financial laws. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB. This new federal and
state regulatory framework may result in significant new regulatory requirements applicable to the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries in respect of consumer financial products and services, with potentially significant increases in compliance
costs and litigation risks.

•

Limitation on Federal Preemption

. The Dodd-Frank Act reduces the ability of national banks and federal thrifts to rely upon federal
preemption of state consumer financial laws. Although the OCC will have the ability to make preemption determinations where certain conditions are met, the limitation on federal preemption has the potential to create a patchwork of federal and state
compliance obligations. This could, in turn, result in significant new regulatory requirements applicable to the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries, with potentially significant changes in their operations and increases in their compliance costs.
It could also result in uncertainty concerning compliance, with attendant regulatory and litigation risks.

Many of the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented pursuant to regulations over the course of several months or years.
Given the uncertainty associated with future regulatory actions, the full impact such requirements will have on the Corporation’s operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of the
Corporation’s banking subsidiaries, require changes to certain of the Corporation’s business practices, impose upon the Corporation more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements, and could adversely affect certain of the
Corporation’s business activities. These changes may also require the Corporation and its subsidiaries to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new requirements.

Holding Company Support and Cross-Guarantees under the FDIA

The Dodd-Frank Act amends the FDIA to obligate the Federal Reserve Board to require bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength for any
subsidiary depository institution. The appropriate federal banking agency for such a depository institution may require reports from companies that own the insured depository institution to assess their ability to serve as a source of strength and
to enforce compliance with the source-of-strength requirements. The term “source of financial strength” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event
of financial distress at such subsidiaries. By July 21, 2011, the appropriate federal banking agencies must jointly adopt implementing regulations. Under this requirement, the Corporation in the future could be required to provide financial
assistance to the Corporation’s subsidiary depository institutions should any of them experience financial distress.

Under the FDIA, when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control, each of those depository institutions may be
liable for any loss incurred, or expected to be incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the default of any of the others. Each also may be liable for any assistance the FDIC provides to the other institutions. “Default” means the
appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution. Thus, any of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the FDIC if the FDIC were to suffer a loss in connection with any of the Corporation’s other banking
subsidiaries.



This cross-guarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be
subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities, secured obligations, any other general or senior liability, and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors, other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the
depository institution (with certain exceptions).

Payment of Dividends

The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The principal source of funds for the Corporation is
dividends from the Bank. As a result, the Corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations. Dividend
payments from the Bank are subject to Illinois law and to regulatory limitations, generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings, imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the Bank. The ability of the Bank to
pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability, financial condition or other cash flow requirements.

The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies. The policy statement provides that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank
holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the
holding company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Accordingly, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding
company’s financial health, such as by borrowing.

Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of
dividends the Bank can pay to the Corporation without regulatory approval. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System if the total of all
dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member
bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits, as defined, without regulatory and stockholder approval.

The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized. In addition, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or
bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The payment of dividends could, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III
(as described below) impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends.

Capital Adequacy Requirements

The Federal Reserve Board has established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies, including
the Corporation. The current risk-based capital guidelines that apply to the Corporation and its U.S. subsidiary banks, commonly referred to as Basel I, are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the International Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (Basel Committee), a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, as implemented by the Federal Reserve Board. As discussed further below, the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted new risk-based capital guidelines for
“core banks,” including the Corporation, based upon the Revised Framework for the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (Basel II) issued by the Basel Committee in November 2005.

Under the existing Basel I-based guidelines, the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (which are primarily the credit
risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet items such as standby letters of credit, but also include a nominal market risk equivalent balance related to foreign exchange and debt/equity trading activities) is eight
percent. At least half of the total capital must be composed of tier 1 capital, which includes common stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings), qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (and, for bank holding companies only,
a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities), and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other disallowed intangibles, and
disallowed deferred tax assets, among other items. The Federal Reserve Board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies, requiring tier 1 capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets (as
defined for regulatory purposes), net of the loan loss reserve, goodwill and certain other intangible assets.

The federal
banking regulators have also established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines that insured banks and thrifts are required to meet. These regulations are generally similar to those established by the Federal Reserve Board for bank holding
companies. The risk-based and leverage capital ratios for the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries,



together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “well-capitalized,” are provided in the following chart.

As mentioned above,
the Corporation also is subject to the Basel II framework for risk-based capital adequacy. The U.S. bank regulatory agencies have issued final rules with respect to implementation of the Basel II framework. Under the final Basel II rules, the
Corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations. As a result, the Corporation and its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries will be required to use the advanced approaches under Basel II for calculating risk-based
capital related to credit risk and operational risk, instead of the methodology reflected in the regulations effective prior to adoption of Basel II. The rules also require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall
capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles, and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy.

In order to implement the rules, a core banking organization, such as the Corporation, is required to (and the Corporation did) adopt an implementation plan and must satisfactorily complete a parallel
run, in which it calculates capital requirements under both the Basel II rules and regulations effective prior to the adoption of Basel II. In the U.S., the Corporation entered the parallel run of calculations under both the old and new guidelines
in April 2010.

The Corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the advanced approaches of the Basel II
framework. The Corporation is also addressing issues related to implementation timing differences between the U.S. and other jurisdictions, to ensure that the Corporation and the bank subsidiaries comply with regulatory requirements and expectations
in all jurisdictions where they operate. The Corporation’s U.K., Guernsey and Canadian entities subject to Basel II rules have already adopted the standardized approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk in
calculating minimum regulatory capital requirements.

Current results from the parallel run of the Basel II risk-based capital
framework have demonstrated that the use of the advanced approaches of the Basel II framework have not resulted in the Corporation’s or the Bank’s tier 1 capital or total risk-based capital ratios falling below the levels required for
categorization as “well capitalized.”

On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision,
the oversight body of the Basel Committee, announced agreement on the calibration and phase-in arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as Basel III. Under these standards, when fully phased-in on January 1, 2019,
banking institutions will be required to satisfy three risk-based capital ratios:

•

A tier 1 common equity ratio of at least 7.0%, inclusive of 4.5% minimum tier 1 common equity ratio, net of regulatory deductions, and the new 2.5%
“capital conservation buffer” of common equity to risk-weighted assets;

•

A tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5%, inclusive of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer; and

•

A total capital ratio of at least 10.5%, inclusive of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer.

The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a tier 1 common
equity ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall. The Basel Committee also announced that a “countercyclical
buffer” of 0% to 2.5% of common equity or other loss-absorbing capital “will be implemented according to national circumstances” as an “extension” of the conservation buffer during periods of excess credit growth.



Basel III also introduces a non-risk adjusted tier 1 leverage ratio of 3%, based on a
measure of total exposure rather than total assets and new liquidity standards. The phase-in of the new rules is to commence on January 1, 2013, with the phase-in of the capital conservation buffer commencing January 1, 2015 and the rules
to be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019.

In November 2010, Basel III was endorsed by the Seoul G20 Leaders Summit and
will be subject to individual adoption by member nations, including the United States. On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued the text of the Basel III rules, which presents the details of global regulatory standards on bank capital
adequacy and liquidity agreed by the Basel Committee and endorsed by the Seoul G20 Leaders Summit. The federal banking agencies will likely implement changes to the current capital adequacy standards applicable to the Corporation and its bank
subsidiaries in light of Basel III. If adopted by federal banking agencies, Basel III could lead to significantly higher capital requirements and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios. The ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity
standards on the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries is currently being reviewed and will depend on a number of factors, including the rulemaking and implementation by the U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation cannot determine the ultimate
effect that potential legislation, or subsequent regulations, if enacted, would have upon the Corporation’s earnings or financial position. In addition, significant questions remain as to how the capital and liquidity mandates of the Dodd-Frank
Act will be integrated with the requirements of Basel III. However, as the Corporation currently understands Basel III, it believes its capital strength, balance sheet and business model leave it well positioned for Basel III.

Note that the Dodd-Frank Act also requires the establishment of more stringent prudential standards by requiring the federal banking
agencies to adopt capital and liquidity requirements which address the risks that the activities of an institution pose to the institution and the public and private stakeholders, including risks arising from certain enumerated activities. In
particular, the Dodd-Frank Act excludes trust preferred securities issued on or after May 19, 2010 from tier 1 capital. For depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of more than $15 billion at December 31,
2009, trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 will be phased-out of tier 1 capital over a three-year period.

Prompt
Corrective Action

Under the FDIA, the federal banking agencies must take “prompt corrective action” against
undercapitalized U.S. depository institutions. U.S. depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly
undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized,” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls. Under certain circumstances, a well capitalized, adequately
capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. A banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan. Failure to meet capital
guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including: termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, restrictions on certain business activities, and appointment of the FDIC as
conservator or receiver. As of December 31, 2010, the Corporation and all of its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized.”

Enforcement Powers of the Federal Banking Agencies

A principal objective of the U.S. bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banks. To that end, the banking regulators have broad regulatory,
examination, and enforcement powers, including the power to issue cease and desist orders, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with
applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory agreements could subject the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries, as well as officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and
potentially substantial civil money penalties. The appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the FDIC as conservator or receiver for a banking institution (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) if any one or more of a
number of circumstances exist, including, without limitation, the fact that the banking institution:

•

is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized;

•

fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so;

•

fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan;

•

materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan; or

•

fails to submit an acceptable resolution plan.

The FDIC may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe
or unsound practices or has violated any



applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency. Engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws,
regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the Bank, the Corporation, and other subsidiaries of the Corporation, or their officers, directors, and institution-affiliated parties to the remedies described above and other sanctions.

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders

The Corporation’s bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions under federal law, including Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Board (i.e., Section 23A and B of the Federal Reserve Act), which
limit certain transactions with the Corporation and its non-banking subsidiaries, including loans, other extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases. Such transactions by a banking subsidiary with any one affiliate are limited in amount to
10 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus and, with all affiliates together, to an aggregate of 20 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus. Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit, as well as certain other transactions, are
required to be secured in specified amounts. These and certain other transactions with the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, including any payment of money by a banking subsidiary, must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith
would be, offered to nonaffiliated companies.

The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with
affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending
arrangements, and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. The definition of “affiliate” was expanded to include any investment fund to which the
Corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser. The ability of the Federal Reserve Board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed, including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators.

The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and their related interests (collectively referred to
herein as “insiders”) contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O apply to all federally insured institutions. These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be
made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans (including credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements) to insiders and their related interests. These loans cannot exceed the
institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus, and the FDIC may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions. The Dodd
Frank Act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders.

Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Legislation, and Office of Foreign Assets Control

Under federal law, including the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act, financial institutions (including insured
depository institutions, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions) must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures, and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee
training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and
customer identification in their dealings with non-U.S. financial institutions and non-U.S. customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to
report any suspicious transactions, and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these
obligations and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions. The regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and
desist” orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations.

The
Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for requiring that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons,
organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If the Corporation or the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is
on an OFAC list, the Corporation or the Bank must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.

Many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the Corporation’s non-U.S. offices. The Corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and
the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions.



Deposit Insurance and Assessments

FDIC-insured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC. The amount of a particular
institution’s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution’s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution’s risk classification is assigned based on the level of supervisory concern the
institution poses to the regulators, and the institution’s capital levels and other risk measures. The FDIC recently raised assessment rates to increase funding for the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), which is currently under-funded.

The Dodd Frank Act makes permanent the general $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. In addition, federal deposit
insurance for the full net amount of deposits in noninterest bearing transaction accounts was extended to January 1, 2013 for all insured banks.

The Dodd-Frank Act changes the deposit insurance assessment framework, primarily by basing assessments on an institution’s total assets less tangible equity (subject to risk-based adjustments that
would further reduce the assessment base for custodial banks) rather than domestic deposits, which is expected to shift a greater portion of the aggregate assessments to large banks. The Dodd-Frank Act also increases the minimum designated reserve
ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits by September 30, 2020, eliminates the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC each year, and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay
dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.

On December 14, 2010, the FDIC
raised the minimum designated reserve ratio of DIF to 2%. The ratio is higher than the minimum reserve ratio of 1.35% as set by the Dodd-Frank Act.

On February 7, 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule on Assessments, Dividends, Assessment Base and Large Bank Pricing. The final rule, mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, changes the deposit insurance
assessment system from one that is based on domestic deposits to one that is based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. Because the new assessment base under the Dodd-Frank Act is larger than the current assessment
base, the final rule’s assessment rates are lower than the current rates, which achieves the FDIC’s goal of not significantly altering the total amount of revenue collected from the industry. In addition, the final rule adopts a
“scorecard” assessment scheme for larger banks and suspends dividend payments if the DIF reserve ratio exceeds 1.5% but provides for decreasing assessment rates when the DIF reserve ratio reaches certain thresholds. The final rule further
reduces the assessment base for custodial banks by the daily or weekly average of a certain amount of low-risk assets (i.e., assets with a Basel risk weighting of 0%, regardless of maturity, plus 50% of assets with a Basel risk weighting of 20%,
again regardless of maturity) subject to the limitation that the daily or weekly average value of these assets cannot exceed the daily or weekly average value of those deposits classified as transaction accounts and identified by the institution as
being directly linked to a fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping account. The final rule identifies custodial banks as insured depository institutions with previous calendar year-end trust assets (i.e., fiduciary and custody and safekeeping assets)
of at least $50 billion or those insured depository institutions that derived more than 50% of their revenue (interest income plus non-interest income) from trust activity over the previous calendar year. Based on current understanding of the final
rule, the Corporation’s depository institution subsidiaries will likely pay slightly lower assessments to the DIF than under the old system. The final rule will take effect for the quarter beginning April 1, 2011, and will be reflected in
the invoices for assessments due September 30, 2011.

Continued action by the FDIC to replenish the DIF as well as the
changes contained in the Dodd Frank Act are likely to result in higher assessment rates, which would reduce the profitability of the Corporation’s depository institution subsidiaries.

In addition to its insurance assessment, each insured bank is subject in 2011 to quarterly debt service assessments in connection with
bonds issued by a government corporation that financed the federal savings and loans bailout. The first quarter 2011 debt service assessment is .0102%.

Control Acquisitions

Banking laws impose notice, approval, and ongoing
regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution. Among other things, these laws require regulatory filings by a shareholder or other
party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution. The determination whether an investor “controls” a depository institution is based on all of the facts and circumstances
surrounding the investment. As a general matter, a party is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the party owns or controls 25% or more of any class of its voting stock. Subject to rebuttal, a party may be presumed to
control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 10% or more of any class of its voting stock. Ownership by affiliated parties, or parties acting in concert, is typically aggregated for these purposes. If a
party’s ownership of the Corporation were to exceed certain thresholds, the investor could be deemed to “control” the Corporation for regulatory purposes. This could subject the investor to regulatory filings or other regulatory
consequences.



Interstate Banking and Branching

Federal law permits an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company, with Federal Reserve Board approval, to acquire
banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding company’s home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law. In addition, national banks and state banks with different home states are
permitted to merge across state lines, with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, unless the home state of a participating banking institution passed legislation prior to June 1, 1997 that expressly prohibits interstate
mergers. The Dodd Frank Act permits a national bank or a state bank, with the approval of its regulator, to open a branch in any state if the law of the state in which the branch is to be located would permit the establishment of the branch if the
bank were a bank chartered in that state. Thrift institutions (like Northern Trust Bank, FSB) may freely engage in de novo branching on an interstate basis. National banks, such as Northern Trust, NA, may provide trust services in any state to the
same extent as a trust company chartered by that state.

Community Reinvestment Act

The Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to the CRA. The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to
encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a
bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications, and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. The federal banking agencies are
required to make public the rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance record of its bank subsidiaries is reviewed by federal banking agencies in connection with the filing of an
application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or thrift or to merge with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction. Each of the Corporation’s banking
subsidiaries, including the Bank, received at least a satisfactory CRA rating from its regulator in its most recent CRA examination.

In addition, federal law requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups that relate to the CRA, and contains various other provisions designed to improve the delivery of financial
services to consumers while maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial services industry.

Privacy and Security

Federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by, among other provisions, requiring banks to
adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain rules with respect to the disclosure to third parties of consumer information. The Corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies
pursuant to law. Regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security, confidentiality and integrity of customer information, and require notice to regulators, and in some cases, to customers, in the event of security
breaches. A number of states have adopted their own statutes concerning financial privacy and requiring notification of security breaches.

Consumer Laws and Regulations

In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above, the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in
transactions with banks. While the following list is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include:

•

Truth in Lending Act;

•

Truth in Savings Act;

•

Electronic Funds Transfer Act;

•

Expedited Funds Availability Act;

•

Equal Credit Opportunity Act;

•

Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act;

•

Fair Housing Act;



•

Fair Credit Reporting Act;

•

Fair Debt Collection Act;

•

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act;

•

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act;

•

Right to Financial Privacy Act;

•

Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act;

•

laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices; and

•

usury laws.

Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition, to those listed above. These laws and
regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers and monitor account activity when taking deposits, making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with
such customers. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties, operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution. The creation of the CFPB by the Dodd-Frank Act is likely to lead to
enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws.

Future Legislation

Federal, state and local legislators and regulators regularly introduce measures or take actions that would modify the regulatory
requirements applicable to banks, thrifts, their holding companies and their affiliates. Such legislation may change the banking statutes and the operating environment of the Corporation and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways.
The Corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that future legislation or implementing regulations might have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Corporation or its subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes substantial
changes to the regulatory framework applicable to the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The majority of these changes will be implemented over time by various regulatory agencies. The full effect that these changes will have on the Corporation and
its subsidiaries remains uncertain at this time and may have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Corporation or its subsidiaries.

Selected Average Assets and Liabilities Attributable to Non-U.S. Operations

The SEC requires the disclosure of the reserve for credit losses that is applicable to international
operations. The above table has been prepared in compliance with this disclosure requirement and is used in determining non-U.S. operating performance. The amounts shown in the table should not be construed as being the only amounts that are
available for non-U.S. loan charge-offs, since the entire reserve for credit losses assigned to loans and leases is available to absorb losses on both U.S. and non-U.S. loans. In addition, these amounts are not intended to be indicative of future
charge-off trends.

Supplemental Item—Executive Officers of the Registrant

The following table sets forth certain information with regard to each executive officer of the Corporation.

All of the executive officers have been officers of the Corporation, or a subsidiary of the Corporation, for more than five years.

The positions of Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President are elected annually by the Board of Directors at the first meeting of the Board of Directors held after each annual meeting
of stockholders. The other officers are appointed annually by the Board. Officers continue to hold office until their successors are duly elected or until their death, resignation or removal by the Board.

Item 1A—Risk Factors

From an investor’s standpoint, public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks. However, each company’s unique combination of strategies,
markets served, product and service offerings, processes and systems, and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks. Following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in Northern
Trust’s business.

We explain below that many of the risks we discuss can reduce our earnings, as a result of recognizing
losses or otherwise. You should understand that significant reductions in earnings can have further negative effects on us in addition to reducing the price of our common stock and other securities, such as: reducing our capital, which can have
regulatory and other consequences; affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us, with a resulting negative effect on our



ability to conduct and grow our businesses; and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers and so affecting our ability to raise capital and secure
other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so.

This list is not necessarily complete because we may have failed
to appreciate the potential impact on us of risks not described here. We identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls. If we fail to continue to successfully identify and manage
significant risks, we could incur financial loss. We may also suffer damage to our reputation that would restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably, or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that would limit some of
our activities or make them significantly more expensive.

Economic, Market, and Monetary Policy Risks

Northern Trust carries on a global business. Changes in conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions could
adversely affect Northern Trust’s businesses. Factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices, the overall pace of capital markets activities, interest rates, currency exchange rates, investor sentiment and inflation or
deflation can affect our results.

•

A downturn in economic conditions, such as the recent severe global economic downturn, can negatively affect our earnings.

•

Economic weakness can affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans, causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit,
a higher level of charge-offs, and higher provision for credit losses, all of which reduce our earnings.

•

Economic weakness can also reduce the fees we earn for managing and servicing our clients’ assets. For example, the recent downturn in equity
markets and the decrease in the value of some debt-related investments as a result of market disruption or illiquidity reduce the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others. This reduces our earnings since a significant part of the
fees we earn is based on asset values.

•

Weak economic conditions also affect wealth creation, investment preferences, trading activities, and savings patterns, which impact demand for our
trust and investment products and services. Reduced transaction volumes would also negatively impact our earnings.

•

A slowing of the globalization of investment activity or pension reform could limit our revenue growth

. We believe we have profited from the
increasing globalization of investment activity and from pension reform in many nations that has generated new pools of assets that require management and servicing. Any slowing or reversal of this globalization of financial activity and markets or
other such trends would adversely affect factors that have been important in Northern Trust’s recent growth.

•

Instability, disruption or a lack of confidence in the political, economic, legal or regulatory systems of the emerging markets in which we operate
could expose us to liability or loss

. Northern Trust’s expanding business activities in emerging markets, including investments made for clients in those markets, present risks inherent in conducting these activities in less mature and
often less regulated business and investment environments.

•

Changes in interest rates can negatively affect our earnings

. The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings.
Falling rates or rates that remain low may reduce our net interest margin, which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. A low interest rate environment can also
reduce fees earned on certain of our products. For example, in 2009 and 2010, we waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the low level of short-term interest rates. Lower net interest margins and fee waivers negatively
impact our earnings.

•

Volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our earnings

. Periods of lower foreign currency volatility can
result in reduced foreign exchange trading income. We hold various non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities and maintain investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. We also provide foreign exchange services to our clients, primarily in
connection with our global custody business, and effect other transactions in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Foreign currency volatility and fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets, investments, and
cash flows and raise the potential for losses



resulting from foreign currency trading positions, where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other, or offset each other in
different time periods. If the policies and procedures we have in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange volatility, including hedging-related strategies, are not followed or are not effective to mitigate such risks, our
results and earnings may be negatively affected. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Risk Management – Market Risk Management –
Asset/Liability Management – Foreign Exchange Risk Management” in the 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders (page 62).

•

Declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can negatively affect our earnings

. The value of securities available for
sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions. Generally, the fair value of those securities is determined based upon market values available from
third party sources. The recent period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption has negatively affected the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and asset-backed and auction rate securities in particular. To the extent that any
portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities results from declines in securities values that management determines to be other-than-temporary, the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated
recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned
“Risk Management – Asset Quality and Credit Risk Management – Securities Portfolio” in the 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 52-53) and the section of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2010
Annual Report to Stockholders captioned “Note 3 – Securities” (pages 78-81) for additional information.

•

Changes in a number of particular market conditions can negatively affect our earnings

. In past periods, reductions in the volatility of
currency trading markets, the level of cross-border investing activity, or the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have negatively affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and
securities lending. If these conditions occur in the future, our earnings from these activities may be negatively affected. In a few of our businesses, such as securities lending, our fee is calculated as a percentage of our client’s earnings,
so that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues. The recent extraordinary market conditions have produced losses in some securities lending programs. Such market
conditions also have reduced borrower demand and led some clients to withdraw from these programs. A persistence or worsening of these conditions could result in additional withdrawals and decreased activity. See the section of
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements – Variable Interests” in the 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 45-46) and the
section of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders captioned “Note 27 – Variable Interest Entities” (pages 111-113) for additional information.

•

Changes in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the United States, non-U.S. governments and
international agencies can reduce our earnings and negatively affect our growth prospects

. For example, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, and its policies
determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing. Changes in interest rates and our cost of funds can negatively affect earnings. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board can reduce the value of
financial instruments we hold. Its policies also can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available. This can increase the risk that they may fail to repay their loans from us.

•

Failure to develop and implement contingency plans to address market disruptions could adversely affect us

. Our success in the area of highly
complex asset servicing relationships depends, in part, on our development and successful implementation of contingency plans to address significant market disruptions caused by bankruptcy, insolvency or illiquidity. If we fail to develop or
successfully implement contingency plans for these market disruptions, our results and business may be negatively affected.

•

Governmental action to combat recent economic weakness and financial market disruption may not succeed, with various adverse effects on us

.
Since mid-2008, there have been unprecedented disruptions in global financial markets, including volatility in asset values and constraints on the availability of credit. In response to these developments, the U.S. and other governments have taken
steps designed to stabilize markets generally and strengthen financial institutions in particular. The recent upheaval in global financial markets has accentuated each of the risks identified above and magnified their potential effect on Northern
Trust. To the extent that these



governmental stabilization and mitigation activities are not successful or adversely change the competitive structure of the financial services industry, these developments could have an adverse
impact on Northern Trust’s revenues, costs, credit losses, access to capital, and liquidity. They also may impose additional limitations or costs on Northern Trust’s business.

Operational Risks

•

Errors, breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can
subject us to liability, result in losses or negatively affect our earnings in other ways

. In our asset servicing, investment management, fiduciary administration, and other business activities, Northern Trust effects or processes transactions
for clients and for itself that involve very large amounts of money. Failure to properly manage or mitigate operational risks can have adverse consequences, and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting
losses.

•

Many types of operational risks can negatively affect our earnings

. Many factors can impact operations and expose us to risks that may vary in
size, scale and scope, including:

•

Human errors or omissions, including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures;

•

Theft, fraud or misappropriation of assets, whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties;

•

Defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems;

•

Breakdowns in processes, including manual processes, which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes, and over-reliance on manual
processes, breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the technology and facilities that support our operations;

•

Unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades;

•

Defects in product design or delivery;

•

Difficulty in accurately pricing assets, which can be aggravated by increased asset coverage, market volatility and illiquidity, and lack of reliable
pricing from vendors;

•

Negative developments in relationships with key counterparties, vendors, employees, or associates in our day-to-day operations; and

•

External events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as natural disasters, epidemics, computer viruses, geopolitical events, political
unrest or terrorist events.

•

Our dependence on technology exposes us to risks that also can result in losses

. Automated systems to record and process transactions, as well
as to monitor positions and price assets, reduce the risk of human error, but our necessary dependence on such systems also increases the risk that system flaws or manipulation of those systems will result in losses. The failure to upgrade systems
as necessary to support growth and changing business needs also could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business changes prior to and during introduction
and deployment of key technological systems or failure to adequately align evolving client commitments and expectations with operational capabilities can have a negative impact on our operations.

•

We may fail to detect errors resulting in losses that continue until the problems are detected and fixed

. Given the high volume of transactions
we process, errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected.

•

Our business continuity plans may not work and thus fail to prevent losses from operational failures

. Our business continuity plans address many
of these risks, but may not operate successfully to mitigate them. If they do not, we could incur losses, liability to clients or others and reduced earnings. In recent years, we have expanded the



operational support located in certain jurisdictions where the electricity, communications and other systems necessary to support our activities may not be as strong as in the U.S. This increases
the risk that problems with these systems may occur and disrupt our operations, resulting in losses.

•

Failure of any of our third party vendors to perform can result in losses

. Third party vendors provide key components of our business operations
such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have established risk management processes and continuity plans, any disruptions in service
from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could negatively affect our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay
and expense.

These risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex, and as our increasingly
international business requires end-to-end management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many inter-related products and services.

Investment Performance, Fiduciary and Asset Servicing Risks

Revenues from
our investment management, fiduciary, and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings.

•

Failure to produce adequate and competitive returns can negatively affect our earnings and growth prospects

. If we do not generate competitive
risk-adjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes, we will have greater difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business, which would negatively affect our earnings and prospects.

•

If we fail to comply with legal standards, we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients, which could negatively affect our earnings

.
Managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important to client satisfaction, which in turn is important to the earnings and growth of our investment businesses.
Failure to comply with these standards, adequately manage these risks, or manage the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities could also result in liability.

•

We may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings

. We may find it necessary to take action or incur
expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings, liquidity or valuation issues or other developments, even though we are not
required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments. For example, we entered into credit support agreements with respect to certain investment funds and we incurred substantial charges to reflect that support in the third quarter of 2008.
These credit support agreements expired in 2009. We incurred other significant charges in that quarter to support securities lending clients and clients who had purchased certain illiquid auction rate securities. The risk that we will decide to take
such action and incur the resulting losses is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted.

Credit Risks

A number
of Northern Trust’s product offerings involve credit risk, which is the risk that other parties will not fulfill their financial obligations to us. These product offerings include loans, leases, derivatives, foreign exchange and other credit
commitments.

•

Failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain adequate reserves for credit losses can result in
losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings

. We evaluate credit commitments before we make them and then reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent
in our loan portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. This process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments. Challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessment
and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors. Reserves that prove to be inadequate can directly and negatively affect earnings.

•

Weakened economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings

.
Credit risk levels and our earnings can also be affected by the strength of the



economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit and adverse changes in the financial performance or
condition of our borrowers which could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans. Our provisions for credit losses were significantly higher in 2009 and 2010 than in prior periods due to prolonged weakness in the economic
environment. For a fuller discussion of the reserve and provision for credit losses for 2010, 2009, and 2008, see the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned
“Asset Quality and Credit Risk Management” in the 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 52-60).

•

The failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss

. The financial markets are characterized by
extensive interconnections among financial institutions, including banks, broker/dealers, collective investment funds and insurance companies. As a result of these interconnections, we and many of our clients have significant counterparty exposure
to other financial institutions. This counterparty exposure presents significant risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties (or in some cases of our clients’ counterparties) has the
potential to expose us to risk of loss. The recent instability of the financial markets has resulted in many financial institutions becoming significantly less creditworthy, and as a result we are exposed to increased counterparty risks, both as
principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients. Changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly, is often based upon a variety of factors and is difficult to predict. In addition,
as U.S. and non-U.S. governments have addressed the financial crisis in an evolving manner, the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain. If a significant
individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us, we could incur financial losses that materially adversely affect our business, our financial condition and our results of operations. Given the limited number of strong counterparties in the
current market, we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients’ counterparty credit risk. The consolidation of financial service firms and the failures of other financial institutions have increased the concentration of our counterparty
risk.

Liquidity Risks

Northern Trust depends on access to capital markets to provide sufficient capital resources and other funds to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash
management needs of our clients.

•

Many events or circumstances could adversely affect our capital costs, our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our ability to meet our
commitments

. Inadequate capital or the inability to meet our commitments could cause us to incur liability, restrict our ability to grow, or require us to take actions that would negatively affect our earnings. Among the developments that could
have this effect are:

•

A loss of confidence of debt purchasers, depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets generally or in transactions with Northern
Trust;

•

Disruption in the market for debt-related securities; and

•

A significant downgrade of any of our debt ratings.

See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the 2010 Annual Report to
Stockholders (pages 47-49).

•

Our success with large, complex clients can put strains on our balance sheet and impose substantial liquidity requirements

. Our failure to
successfully manage these balance sheet and liquidity issues would have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow.

•

If the Bank or the other subsidiaries of the Corporation were unable to supply the Corporation with funds over time, the Corporation could be unable
to meet its various obligations

. The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. It relies primarily on dividends paid to it by these subsidiaries to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to
stockholders of the Corporation. There are various legal



limitations on the extent to which the Bank and the other subsidiaries can supply funds to the Corporation by dividend or otherwise. See “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1 of
this report.

Regulation Risks

Virtually every aspect of Northern Trust’s business around the world is regulated, generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions. In the
United States, the Corporation, the Bank, and many of the Corporation’s other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. These regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required
capital levels to prohibited activities. They are specifically directed at protecting depositors, the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. The Corporation and its subsidiaries are also heavily
regulated by bank, securities and other regulators globally.

•

Failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our
business, or that reduce earnings

. Regulatory violations or failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties, require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business, result in limitations
on our ability to conduct business, restrict our ability to expand, or adversely impact our reputation. Failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could adversely affect proposed business opportunities and
results of operations.

•

Changes in regulatory capital requirements could result in reduced earnings

. The Dodd-Frank Act, the implementation of Basel II and, if adopted
by regulators, the implementation of Basel III, could lead to significantly higher capital requirements, higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios, and could impact the capital allocations to various business
activities. The ultimate impact of the evolving capital and liquidity standards on us will depend on a number of factors, including the interpretation and implementation of capital and leverage requirements by the U.S. banking regulators.

•

Compliance with evolving regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies may impact us in ways that are difficult to
predict

. Laws, regulations, and their interpretation by regulatory agencies may change or generate enhanced scrutiny of particular activities. Those changes or enhanced emphasis can impose costs or otherwise affect our ability to compete
successfully. The Dodd Frank Act will impose many new regulatory requirements on banking institutions, the full impact of which cannot be determined until implementing regulations are issued. It is possible that additional legislative or regulatory
requirements could be imposed in the U.S. or in other countries that could have an adverse impact on our business activities, our costs of compliance, and our revenues and earnings. Moreover, many regulatory initiatives, including anti-money
laundering rules, anti-bribery laws, home mortgage lending and loan modification requirements, and other regulatory requirements or priorities, could increase compliance costs and legal risks, and could lead to financial and reputational damage in
the event of a violation. The full scope and impact of possible enhanced regulatory and enforcement scrutiny and evolving legislation and regulation is uncertain and difficult to predict.

See “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1 of this report.

Litigation Risks

Our businesses involve the risk that clients or others
may sue us, claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty owed to them. Our trust, custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk. This risk may be heightened
during periods when credit, equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile, or when clients or investors are experiencing losses. In addition, as a publicly-held company, we are subject to the risk of
claims under the federal securities laws, and volatility in the stock prices of Northern Trust and other financial institutions increases this risk.

•

These claims can result in significant liability or damage to our reputation, which could result in a loss

. Even where we defend them
successfully, these matters are often expensive to defend. These claims may also cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients, or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties, rating agencies, and stockholders, and so
negatively affect our earnings.

•

We may fail to set aside adequate reserves or otherwise underestimate our liability, with a negative effect on our earnings

. We estimate our
potential liability for pending and threatened claims, and record reserves when



appropriate pursuant to U.S. GAAP, by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations. This process is subject to the
risk that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts, and to the risk that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case. Earnings will be adversely affected to
the extent that our reserves are not adequate.

Tax Risks

In the course of its business, Northern Trust is sometimes subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities regarding the
amount of taxes due.

•

These challenges can result in reduced earnings in a number of ways

. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of
taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of which can require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise negatively affect earnings.

•

Our provision for structured lease transactions may prove to be inadequate, resulting in additional tax provisions or reduced earnings

. In
recent years, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has proposed to disallow tax deductions related to certain types of structured leasing transactions. If our reserves for tax liabilities prove to be inadequate, we would have to make an additional
adjustment that would negatively affect earnings.

•

Changes in tax laws and interpretations can negatively affect our earnings

. Both U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities from time to time issue new,
or modify existing, tax laws and regulations. These authorities may also issue new, or modify existing, interpretations of those laws and regulations. These new laws, regulations or interpretations, and the Corporation’s actions taken in
response to, or reliance upon, such changes in the tax laws may impact the Corporation’s tax position in a manner that results in lower earnings.

Strategic and Competitive Risks

We have grown through a combination of
internal expansion and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities, and we intend to continue to do so. A variety of risks could interfere with these plans.

•

Intervention of the U.S. and other governments in the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face

. In response to the recent
disruptions in global financial markets, the U.S government and other governments around the world have taken, and may take further, unprecedented actions designed to stabilize markets generally and strengthen financial institutions in particular.
For example, the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, created a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to regulate consumer financial services and products and a Financial Stability Oversight Council with regulatory authority over
certain financial companies and activities. Governments also may take actions to significantly change the way financial institutions are regulated, either through new legislation, new regulations, new applications of existing regulations or a
combination of all of these methods. These actions may involve increased intervention by such governments and regulators in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry. Such
intervention may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways. The nature, pace and volume of this government intervention, and our ability to react in a timely manner to regulatory developments, may adversely
impact our ability to compete successfully and, in turn, negatively affect our earnings.

•

If we do not successfully execute expansion plans, we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be negatively impacted

.
Failure to integrate a substantial acquisition would have an adverse effect on our business, as would the failure to execute successfully a significant internal expansion. The challenges arising from the integration of an acquired business or
significant expansion of an existing business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees, clients, suppliers, and other business partners, as well as combining accounting, data processing and internal control systems.

•

Failure to execute our other strategies could also negatively affect our prospects

. Our growth also depends upon successful, consistent
execution of our business strategies in each business unit. Recruiting and maintaining skilled personnel, and deploying such key talent in a manner that allows execution of these strategies is important, particularly in highly complex and rapidly
growing areas of our business. A failure to do so, or to otherwise successfully carry out our plans, could negatively impact growth.



•

We face a variety of competitive challenges that could negatively affect our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings

. We
provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets, in which pricing can be a key competitive factor. Merger activity in the financial services industry, including mergers resulting from government intervention
and the overall disruption in the financial services industry, continues to produce large, in some cases well-capitalized, and geographically-diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at
competitive prices. In certain businesses, such as foreign exchange trading, electronic networks present a competitive challenge. Additionally, technological advances and the growth of internet-based commerce have made it possible for non-depository
institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business. Many of these non-traditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures. These competitive
pressures can negatively affect earnings and our ability to grow.

•

Failure to attract and retain skilled people could negatively affect our prospects

. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to
attract and retain key talent. Competition for the best people in most of our activities can be intense and we may not be able to hire and retain key personnel, including as a result of any restrictions on our compensation practices that may be
imposed by governments or regulators. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and the
difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.

•

We need to constantly invest in innovation, and the inability or failure to do so will negatively affect our businesses and earnings

. Our
success in this competitive environment requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation. This investment is directed at generating new products and services, and adapting existing products and services to the evolving
standards and demands of the marketplace. Among other things, investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins. This investment also focuses on enhancing the
delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients, and includes investment in technological innovation as well. Effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our
product offerings, also is important. Falling behind our competition in any of these areas could adversely affect our business opportunities, growth and earnings.

•

Failure to understand or fully appreciate the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will negatively
affect our businesses and earnings

. Our success in capitalizing on innovation depends, in part, on successful implementation of new product and service initiatives. Not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new
offerings, but we must accurately price them (as well as existing products) on a risk-adjusted basis and effectively deliver them to clients. Our identification of risks arising from new products and services, both in their design and
implementation, and effective responses to those identified risks, including pricing, is key to our capitalizing on innovation and investment in new product and service offerings.

•

Failure to adequately control our costs could negatively affect our ability to compete and thus reduce our earnings

. Our success in controlling
the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results. Another goal of innovation, as a part of our business strategy, is to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses, including the
costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets.

•

Our success with large, complex clients requires understanding of the market and legal, regulatory and accounting standards in new
jurisdictions

. Any failure to understand and deal with those appropriately could affect our growth prospects or negatively affect our reputation.

Reputation Risks

An important reason that clients bring their business to
Northern Trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics, performance, accuracy and compliance.

•

Damage to our reputation can have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete, grow and generate revenue

. Damage to our reputation
for delivery of a high level of service undermines the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and so negatively affects our earnings.



•

Maintaining our reputation is important in other key relationships that affect our businesses and our earnings

. Damage to our reputation also
could affect the confidence of clients, rating agencies, regulators, stockholders and the other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business. Failure to maintain our reputation would ultimately have an adverse effect on
our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business.

•

Reputation risk has many facets that could negatively affect our businesses and earnings

. Reputational risk is particularly significant in the
current environment resulting from the financial crisis. The maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in controlling or mitigating the various risks described above, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately
addressing issues that may arise in a broad range of areas. These issues include potential conflicts of interest and other ethical issues; anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing procedures; client personal information and privacy issues;
effective evaluation of talent and deployment to adequately address complex and rapid growing areas of our businesses, data security; record-keeping; regulatory investigations of Northern Trust or within the banking industry; and any litigation that
arises from the failure or perceived failure of Northern Trust to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

Many of the risks described above are discussed in more detail in the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Risk
Management” in the 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 51-60), in the section of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders captioned “Note 24 – Contingent
Liabilities” (pages 104-105), and in the sections of “Item 1 – Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K captioned “Government Monetary and Fiscal Policies,” “Competition” and “Regulation and
Supervision” (pages 2-13).

Additionally, the risks described above may cause actual results to differ from the
Corporation’s current expectations of future events or future results indicated in what are considered “forward-looking statements” of the Corporation. Forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results are also
discussed in the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Factors Affecting Future Results” in the 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 64-65).

Item 1B—Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2—Properties

The executive offices of the Corporation and the Bank are located at 50 South LaSalle Street in Chicago. This Bank-owned building is occupied by various divisions of Northern Trust’s business units.
Adjacent to this building are two office buildings in which the Bank leases approximately 530,000 square feet of space principally for staff divisions of the business units. Financial services are provided by the Bank and other subsidiaries of the
Corporation through offices in 18 U.S. states. The majority of those offices are leased. The Bank’s primary U.S. operations are located in five facilities: a 555,000 square foot leased facility at 801 South Canal Street in Chicago; a leased
computer data center located in a 405,000 square foot facility at 840 South Canal Street in Chicago, which was sold in the fourth quarter 2010 and will be vacated in third quarter 2011; 200,000 square feet at 231 South LaSalle Street in Chicago in a
sublease arrangement that commenced in first quarter 2011; and two Bank-owned supplementary operations/data center buildings of 65,000 and 73,000 square feet located in the western suburbs of Chicago. A majority of the Bank’s London-based staff
is located at Canary Wharf in London, where 188,000 square feet of office space is leased. Additional support and operations activity originates from Bangalore, where we lease approximately 330,000 square feet in two facilities. The Bank and the
Corporation’s other subsidiaries operate from various other facilities in North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and the Middle East, most of which are leased. In addition to the above-referenced properties, subsidiaries of the
Corporation maintain a number of small operations classified as retirement home/limited access banking locations, back offices, or executive suites.

The Corporation believes that its owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for its business needs. For additional information relating to properties and lease commitments, refer to Note 8
– Buildings and Equipment and Note 9 – Lease Commitments on pages 87-88 of the Corporation’s Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2010, which information is incorporated herein by reference.



Item 3—Legal Proceedings

The information presented in Note 24—Contingent Liabilities beginning on pages 104-105 of the Corporation’s Annual Report to
Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2010 is incorporated herein by reference.

On January 16, 2009, an
amended complaint was filed in a putative class action lawsuit currently pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the Corporation and others. The defendants named in the amended complaint are the
Corporation, the Bank, the Northern Trust Employee Benefits Administrative Committee and its members, the Northern Trust Employee Benefits Investment Committee and its members, and certain other officers, including the present and former Chief
Executive Officers of the Corporation, purportedly on behalf of participants in and beneficiaries of The Northern Trust Company Thrift-Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) whose individual accounts held shares of Corporation common stock at any
time from October 19, 2007 to January 14, 2009. The complaint purports to allege breaches of fiduciary duty in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) related to the Corporation’s stock being offered as an
investment alternative for participants in the Plan and seeks monetary damages in an unspecified amount. At this stage of the suit, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of a material adverse outcome or reasonably estimate the
amount of any potential loss.

On August 24, 2010, a lawsuit (hereinafter referred to as the “Securities Class
Action”) was filed in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against the Corporation and three of its present or former officers, including the present and former Chief Executive Officers of the Corporation, on behalf of a purported
class of purchasers of Northern Trust Corporation stock during the period from October 17, 2007 to October 20, 2009. The complaint alleges that during the purported class period the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act by allegedly taking insufficient provisions for credit losses with respect to the Corporation’s commercial real estate loan portfolio and failing to make sufficient disclosures regarding its securities lending business. Plaintiff
seeks compensatory damages in an unspecified amount. At this stage of the suit, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of a material adverse outcome or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss.

On September 7, 2010, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, purportedly brought on behalf of the Corporation, was filed in the Circuit
Court of Cook County, Illinois against a number of the Corporation’s current and former officers and directors. The Corporation is named as a nominal defendant. The complaint asserts that the individual defendants violated their fiduciary
duties to the Corporation based upon substantially the same allegations made in the Securities Class Action complaint. Certain individual defendants are also alleged to have sold some of their holdings of Northern Trust Corporation stock while in
possession of material nonpublic information. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in an unspecified amount from the individual defendants on behalf of the Corporation. The only relief sought against the Corporation is an order requiring the
implementation of certain corporate governance procedures.
