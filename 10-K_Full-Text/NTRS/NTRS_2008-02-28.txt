NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION

Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) is a financial holding company that is a leading provider of investment management, asset and fund
administration, fiduciary, and banking solutions for corporations, institutions, and affluent individuals. The Corporation conducts business through various U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, including The Northern Trust Company (Bank). The Corporation
has a network of 85 offices in 18 U.S. states and has international offices in 15 locations in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. At December 31, 2007, the Corporation had consolidated total assets of $67.6 billion and
stockholders’ equity of $4.5 billion.

The Bank is an Illinois banking corporation headquartered in the Chicago financial district and
the Corporation’s principal subsidiary. Founded in 1889, the Bank conducts its business through its U.S. operations, its Toronto, London, and Singapore branches, and various U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries. At December 31, 2007, the Bank
had consolidated assets of $58.4 billion and common equity capital of $3.4 billion.

The Corporation expects that, although the operations
of other banking and non-banking subsidiaries will continue to be of increasing significance, the Bank will in the foreseeable future continue to be the major source of the Corporation’s consolidated assets, revenues, and net income. Except
where the context otherwise requires, the term “Northern Trust” refers to Northern Trust Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. A complete list of the Corporation’s direct and indirect subsidiaries is filed as
Exhibit 21 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated into this Item by reference.

BUSINESS UNITS

Effective January 1, 2008, Frederick H. Waddell, assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, following William A.
Osborn’s resignation from that position effective on that day. Mr. Osborn continues to serve as Chairman of the Corporation. Under the leadership of Mr. Waddell, who also serves as President of the Corporation, Northern Trust
organizes its services globally around its two client-focused principal business units: Corporate and Institutional Services (C&IS) and Personal Financial Services (PFS). Two other business units provide services to the two principal business
units: Northern Trust Global Investments (NTGI), which provides investment management, and Worldwide Operations and Technology (WWOT), which provides operating and systems support. For financial management reporting purposes, the operations of NTGI
and WWOT are allocated to the two principal business units. Financial information regarding the Corporation’s business units is included in the Corporation’s Financial Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31,
2007.

The following is a brief summary of each business unit’s activities and the activities of the Corporate Financial Management
Group and the Corporate Risk Management Group.

Corporate and Institutional Services

C&IS is a leading global provider of asset servicing, asset management, and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations,
endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, and government funds. C&IS also offers a full range of commercial banking services, placing special emphasis on developing and supporting institutional relationships in two target markets: large
and mid-sized corporations and financial institutions. Asset servicing, asset management, and related services encompass a full range of state-of-the-art capabilities including: global master trust and custody, trade, settlement, and reporting;
fund administration; cash management; and investment risk and performance analytical services. Client relationships are managed principally through the Bank’s Chicago, London, Singapore and Toronto branch locations with other operations or
representative offices in New Jersey, Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Netherlands, China and Australia. Asset servicing relationships managed by C&IS often include investment management, securities lending, transition management, and
commission recapture services provided through NTGI. C&IS also provides related foreign exchange services in the U.S., U.K., Guernsey, and Singapore. At December 31, 2007, total C&IS assets under custody were $3.8 trillion and assets
under management were $608.9 billion.

Personal Financial Services

PFS provides personal trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services; financial consulting; guardianship and estate administration; qualified retirement plans; and private and business banking. PFS
focuses on high net worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. PFS also includes the Wealth Management Group, which provides customized
products and services to



meet the complex financial needs of individuals and family offices in the United States and throughout the world with assets typically exceeding $75 million.

PFS is one of the largest providers of personal trust services in the United States, with $332.3 billion in assets under custody and
$148.3 billion in assets under management at December 31, 2007. PFS services are delivered through a network of 85 offices in 18 U.S. states as well as offices in London and Guernsey.

Northern Trust Global Investments

NTGI, through
various subsidiaries of the Corporation, provides a broad range of investment management and related services and other products to U.S. and non-U.S. clients of C&IS and PFS. Clients include institutional and individual separately managed
accounts, bank common and collective funds, registered investment companies, non-U.S. collective investment funds and unregistered private investment funds. NTGI offers both active and passive equity and fixed income portfolio management, as well as
alternative asset classes (such as private equity and hedge funds of funds) and multi-manager products and services. NTGI’s activities also include brokerage, securities lending, transition management, and related services. NTGI’s business
operates internationally through subsidiaries, alliances, and distribution arrangements.

Worldwide Operations and Technology

WWOT supports all of Northern Trust’s business activities, including the processing and product management activities of C&IS, PFS, and NTGI.
These activities are conducted principally in the operations and technology centers in Chicago, London, and Bangalore and fund administration centers in Ireland.

Corporate Financial Management Group

The Corporate Financial Management Group includes the Chief Financial Officer,
Corporate Controller, Corporate Treasurer, Corporate Development, Investor Relations and Strategic Sourcing functions. The Group is responsible for Northern Trust’s accounting and financial infrastructure and for managing the Corporation’s
financial position.

Corporate Risk Management Group

The Corporate Risk Management Group includes the Credit Policy and other Corporate Risk Management functions. The Credit Policy function is described in the “Asset Quality and Credit Risk Management” section
of the Financial Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2007 on pages 24-32. The Corporate Risk Management Group monitors, measures, and facilitates the management of risks across the businesses of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES

The earnings of Northern Trust are affected by numerous external influences. Chief among these are general economic conditions, both domestic and international, and actions that governments and their central banks
take in managing their economies. These general conditions affect all of the Northern Trust’s businesses, as well as the quality, value, and profitability of their loan and investment portfolios.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is an important regulator of U.S. economic conditions and has the general objective of promoting
orderly economic growth in the United States. Implementation of this objective is accomplished by the Federal Reserve Board’s open market operations in United States Government securities, its setting of the discount rate at which member banks
may borrow from Federal Reserve Banks and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits. The policies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board may strongly influence interest rates and hence what banks earn on their loans and investments and what
they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds. Fiscal policies in the United States and abroad also affect the composition and use of Northern Trust’s resources.

COMPETITION

The businesses in which Northern Trust operates are very
competitive. Competition is provided by both unregulated and regulated financial services organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and global markets in which Northern Trust conducts operations.

Northern Trust’s principal business strategy is to provide quality financial services to targeted market segments in which it believes it has a
competitive advantage and favorable growth prospects. As part of this strategy, Northern Trust seeks to deliver a level of service to its clients that distinguishes it from its competitors. In addition, Northern Trust emphasizes the development and
growth of recurring sources of fee-based income and is one of a select group of major bank



holding companies in the United States that generates more revenues from fee-based services than from net interest income. Northern Trust seeks to develop
and expand its recurring fee-based revenue by identifying selected markets with good growth characteristics and providing a high level of individualized service to its clients in those markets. Northern Trust also seeks to preserve its asset quality
through established credit review procedures and to maintain a conservative balance sheet. Finally, Northern Trust seeks to operate with a strong management team that includes senior officers having broad experience and long tenure.

Commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions actively compete for deposits, and money market funds and investment
banking firms offer deposit-like services. These institutions, as well as consumer and commercial finance companies, national retail chains, factors, insurance companies, and pension trusts, are important competitors for various types of loans.
Issuers of commercial paper compete actively for funds and reduce demand for bank loans. For personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling services, trust companies, investment banking firms, insurance companies, investment
counseling firms, and others offer active competition. A wide variety of U.S. and non-U.S. companies compete for settlement and other services.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

Financial Holding Company Regulation

Under U.S. law, the Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) as
amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). Consequently, the Corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision, examination, and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. The BHCA and other federal laws
subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws
and regulations. Supervision and regulation of bank holding companies, financial holding companies, and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries, the deposit insurance fund
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of stockholders or other creditors.

Under the BHCA, bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking. As a financial holding company, the Corporation is permitted to
engage in other activities that the Federal Reserve Board, working with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do
not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities. Activities defined to be financial in nature include providing
financial or investment advice; securities underwriting and dealing; insurance underwriting; and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies, subject to significant limitations. They also include activities previously
determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The Corporation may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than
5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

In order to maintain the Corporation’s status as a financial holding company, each of the Corporation’s insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain “well capitalized” and “well
managed” under applicable regulations, and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean,
depending on the requirements not met, that the Corporation could not undertake new activities, make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies, or continue certain activities.

Subsidiary Regulation

The Bank is a member of the
Federal Reserve System, its deposits are insured by the FDIC, and it is subject to regulation by both these entities, as well as by the Division of Banking of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. The Bank is registered
as a government securities dealer in accordance with the Government Securities Act of 1986. As a government securities dealer, its activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of the Treasury. The Bank is also registered as
a transfer agent with the Federal Reserve Board and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board in this area. In addition, the Corporation, the Bank and the



Corporation’s New York trust company subsidiary are subject to regulation by the Banking Department of the State of New York.

The Corporation’s national bank subsidiaries are members of the Federal Reserve System and are subject to regulation by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), with deposits insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Northern Trust Bank, FSB is a federal savings bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to
regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision and the FDIC.

The Corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination
by the Federal Reserve Board. Its broker-dealer subsidiary is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies.
Several subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Other subsidiaries are regulated by the Connecticut
Department of Banking and the Office of the State Bank Commissioner in Delaware. Two families of mutual funds for which the Bank acts as investment adviser and one registered closed-end hedge fund of funds for which another subsidiary serves as
investment adviser are subject to regulation by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Functional Regulation

Enacted in late 1999, the GLBA established a system of federal and state regulation based on functional regulation, meaning that primary regulatory
oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity. Banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators, insurance by state
insurance regulators, and securities activities by the SEC and state securities regulators.

A significant component of the functional
regulation provided in the GLBA relates to the application of federal securities laws and SEC oversight of some bank securities activities previously exempt from broker-dealer regulation. Among other things, the GLBA amended the definitions of
“broker” and “dealer” under the Exchange Act to remove the blanket exemption for banks. The SEC has several times extended the blanket exemption for broker activities by order in order to allow consideration of a regulation to
implement this provision of the GLBA proposed jointly by the SEC and the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006. Without these blanket exemptions, banks may conduct securities activities without
broker-dealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activity-based exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities. Securities activities
outside these exemptions, as a practical matter, need to be conducted by a registered broker-dealer affiliate. The SEC and the Federal Reserve Board in September 2007 adopted a regulation to implement the broker activities exemption of the GLBA that
will become effective for the Bank beginning January 1, 2009. Until that time, the blanket exemption for these activities will remain in place. The GLBA also amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require the registration of any bank or
separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds. The Corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of GLBA and the regulations adopted under them or will
take such action prior to the relevant effective date.

Non-U.S. Regulation

The increasingly important activities of the Corporation’s subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by a number of non-U.S.
regulatory agencies. Subsidiaries conducting banking, investment management, fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the United Kingdom, for example, are authorized to do so pursuant to the UK Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000
or are otherwise subject to regulation under it by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The FSA exercises broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke authorization to conduct a regulated
business upon breach of the relevant regulations, suspend registered employees, and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees. The non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Corporation and branches of the Bank outside
the United States are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Additionally, Northern Trust’s subsidiary banks located outside the U.S. are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the
jurisdictions in which they operate. As of December 31, 2007, each of Northern Trust’s non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements.



Cross-Guarantees Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control, each of those depository
institutions may be liable for any loss incurred, or expected to be incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the default of any of the others. Each also may be liable for any assistance the FDIC provides to the other institutions.
“Default” means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution. Thus, any of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries could be liable to the FDIC if the FDIC were to suffer a loss in connection with any of the
Corporation’s other banking subsidiaries. This cross-guarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities, secured obligations, any other general or senior
liability, and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors, other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution (with certain exceptions). Although neither the Corporation nor any of its nonbanking
subsidiaries may be assessed for such loss under the FDIA, the Corporation has agreed to indemnify each of its banking subsidiaries, other than the Bank, for any payments a banking subsidiary may be liable to pay to the FDIC pursuant to these
provisions of the FDIA.

Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to
its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve Board at times when, absent this Federal Reserve Board policy, it would not otherwise be provided. The Corporation has source of
strength agreements in place with its existing subsidiaries evidencing its commitment to provide such support as needed. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository institution subsidiaries are subordinate in
right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks.

Payment of Dividends

The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The principal source of funds for the Corporation is dividends from the
Bank. As a result, the Corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations. Dividend payments from the
Bank are subject to Illinois law and to regulatory limitations, generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings, imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is
also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability, financial condition or other cash flow requirements.

The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies. The policy statement provides that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company should not maintain a
rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company’s capital needs,
asset quality, and overall financial condition. Accordingly, a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health, such as by
borrowing.

Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to the Corporation without
regulatory approval. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would
exceed the total of its retained net income (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its
undivided profits, as defined, without regulatory and shareholder approval.

The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any
dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized. In addition, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The payment of dividends could,
depending on the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

Capital Adequacy Requirements

The Federal Reserve Board has established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies. The minimum ratio of total capital to
risk-weighted assets (which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet items such as standby letters of credit) is eight percent. At least half of the total capital must be composed of common
stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings), qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (and, for



bank holding companies only, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities), and
minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other disallowed intangibles, and disallowed deferred tax assets, among other items (“tier 1 Capital”). The remainder may consist of a limited amount of
subordinated debt, other perpetual preferred stock, hybrid capital instruments, mandatory convertible debt securities that meet certain requirements, as well as a limited amount of reserves for loan losses (“tier 2 Capital”). The Federal
Reserve Board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies, requiring tier 1 Capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets.

The federal banking regulators have also established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines that insured banks and thrifts are required to meet.
These regulations are generally similar to those established by the Federal Reserve Board for bank holding companies. The risk-based and leverage capital ratios for the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries, together with the regulatory
minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “well-capitalized,” are provided in the following chart.

The federal bank regulatory agencies’ risk-based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory
ratios generally applicable to U.S. banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria, assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating. Banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions
well above the minimum ratios. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve Board guidelines also provide
that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. In addition,
the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that concentration of credit risk, interest rate risk, and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities, as well as an institution’s ability to manage these risks, are important
factors to be taken into account by regulatory agencies in assessing an organization’s overall capital adequacy. The agencies also have adopted an adjustment to the risk-based capital calculations to cover market risk in trading accounts of
certain institutions, and in September 2006 issued a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to amendments to these rules. The risk-based capital regulations also require U.S. banking institutions to effectively measure and monitor their interest
rate risk and to maintain adequate capital for that risk.

In June 2004, the central bank governors and heads of bank supervision of the
G10 countries endorsed a new framework for risk-based capital adequacy, sometimes referred to as Basel II, which had been developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The Basel II framework formed the basis upon which the U.S. regulatory
authorities developed revisions to existing capital adequacy regulations and standards. The latest agreed-upon version of the framework was released by the Basel Committee in November 2005. In December 2007, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies
published final rules, effective April 1, 2008, with respect to implementation of Basel II.

Under the final Basel II rules, the
Corporation is one of what the agencies expect to be a small number of “core” banking organizations. As a result, the Corporation and its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries will be required to use the advanced approaches under Basel
II for calculating risk-based capital related to credit risk and operational risk, instead of the methodology reflected in existing regulations. The U.S. bank regulatory agencies permit banks to apply for exemptions from compliance with Basel II
rules for subsidiaries, where application would not be appropriate based on asset size, level of complexity, risk profile, or scope of operations. Northern Trust intends to apply for such an exemption for Northern Trust Bank, FSB. The new rules also
require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles, and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy.



In order to implement the new rules, a banking organization must satisfactorily complete a four-quarter
parallel run, in which it calculates capital requirements under both the new rules and existing regulations. The organization must then progress through three transitional periods of at least four quarters each, during which the maximum cumulative
reduction in capital requirements from those under the existing regulations may not exceed 5% for the first period, 10% for the second period and 15% for the third period. Supervisory approval is required to move through these transitional periods
and out of the final transitional period. The agencies also have said they will publish a study after the end of the second transitional year that will examine the new framework for any deficiencies.

These changes in the method of calculating capital apply only to risk-based capital requirements. The leverage ratio requirements, which are not
risk-based, will continue to apply.

Non-core U.S. banking organizations that qualify may elect to use the most advanced approaches under
Basel II. The agencies have also said that they intend to issue a proposed rule that would provide all non-core banking organizations with the option to adopt a standardized approach under Basel II, which reflects a simpler methodology than the
advanced approaches required of core banking organizations. The agencies have said that this option will replace a prior proposal to afford non-core banking organizations a somewhat more risk-sensitive version of the current methodology.

The Corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the advanced approaches of the Basel II framework. The Corporation has established
a Program Management Office to oversee the implementation of Basel II across the Corporation. The Corporation is also addressing issues related to implementation timing differences between the U.S. and other jurisdictions, to ensure that the
Corporation and the Bank comply with regulatory requirements and expectations in all jurisdictions where they operate. The Corporation’s U.K., Guernsey and Canadian entities subject to Basel II rules have already adopted or plan to adopt the
standardized approach for calculating capital adequacy.

Preliminary analysis of the Basel II risk-based capital framework suggests that
the use of the advanced approaches of the Basel II framework will have a positive impact on the Corporation’s and the Bank’s Tier I and Total risk-based capital ratios.

Prompt Corrective Action

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991,
the federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized U.S. depository institutions. U.S. depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories: “well capitalized,”
“adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized,” and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within
which the institution falls. Under certain circumstances, a well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. A depository institution is generally
prohibited from making capital distributions (including paying dividends) or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept, renew or roll over
brokered deposits except with a waiver from the FDIC, and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits.

The federal banking regulatory agencies are permitted or, in certain cases, required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within
one of the three undercapitalized categories. Depending on the level of an institution’s capital, the agency’s corrective powers include, among other things:

•

prohibiting the payment of principal and interest on subordinated debt;

•

prohibiting the holding company from making distributions without prior regulatory approval;

•

placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities;

•

placing additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates;

•

restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits;

•

prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; and

•

in the most severe cases, appointing a conservator or receiver for the institution.



A banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan, and such
a plan will not be accepted unless, among other things, the banking institution’s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a
priority of payment in bankruptcy. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and restrictions on
certain business activities. As of December 31, 2007, the Corporation and all of its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as “well capitalized.”

In the release adopting final Basel II rules, the federal banking agencies said that these “prompt corrective action” rules will not be
affected by the Basel II process and that core banking organizations will be required, during the transitional period, to use the lowest capital calculation in each category that results from the application of both the new and the old rules.

Enforcement Powers of the Federal Banking Agencies

The federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to issue cease and desist orders, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, terminate deposit insurance and
appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory agreements could subject the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries, as well as officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties
of these organizations, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties. In addition to the grounds discussed under “Prompt Corrective Action,” the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the FDIC as
conservator or receiver for a banking institution (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist, including, without limitation, the fact that the banking institution:

•

is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized;

•

fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so;

•

fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan; or

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders

The Corporation’s bank subsidiaries
are subject to restrictions under federal law, including Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Board, which limit certain transactions with the Corporation and its non-banking subsidiaries, including loans, other extensions of credit, investments or
asset purchases. Such transactions by a banking subsidiary with any one affiliate are limited in amount to 10 percent of the bank’s capital and surplus and, with all affiliates together, to an aggregate of 20 percent of the bank’s capital
and surplus. Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit, as well as certain other transactions, are required to be secured in specified amounts. These and certain other transactions with the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, including
any payment of money by a banking subsidiary, must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be, offered to nonaffiliated companies.

The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as “insiders”) contained in the Federal Reserve Act and
Regulation O apply to all federally insured institutions. These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and
their related interests. These loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus, and the FDIC may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans
in violation of applicable restrictions. Regulation O institutions are not subject to the prohibitions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 on certain loans to insiders.

Anti-Terrorism Legislation

The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 includes the International Money Laundering
Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, which contains anti-money laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions. These are in addition to requirements contained in
the Bank Secrecy Act. The Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act requires U.S. financial institutions to adopt policies and procedures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing and grants the Secretary of the Treasury
and bank regulatory agencies broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions’



operations as well as sanctions for failure to meet regulatory requirements. The Corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these
laws and the related regulations.

Deposit Insurance

Under the FDIC’s risk-based insurance assessment system, as amended by the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act and implementing regulations effective for 2007, each insured bank is required to pay deposit
insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. Each insured bank is placed in one of four risk categories based on its level of capital, supervisory ratings and other risk measures, including debt ratings for large institutions, and its insurance
assessment rate is determined by its risk category. There is currently a 38 basis point spread between the highest and lowest assessment rates, so that banks classified by the FDIC in Risk Category I are subject in 2008 to an insurance assessment of
five to seven basis points (according to the FDIC’s assessment of the bank’s strength), and banks classified by the FDIC in Risk Category IV are subject to an insurance assessment rate of .43%. Banks which paid assessments prior to
December 31, 1996 are eligible for certain one-time credits against these assessments from a pool provided for in the legislation. As of December 31, 2007, the Bank had remaining credits of $6,447,992 and Northern Trust, N.A. had remaining
credits of $1,459,680. In addition to its insurance assessment, each insured bank is subject in 2008 to quarterly debt service assessments in connection with bonds issued by a government corporation that financed the federal savings and loans
bailout. The first quarter 2008 debt service assessment is .0114%.

Control Acquisitions

The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the Federal
Reserve Board has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve Board, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of
securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, such as the Corporation, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of the Corporation. In addition, any company is required to
obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding common stock of the Corporation, or otherwise obtaining control or a
“controlling influence” over the Corporation or its banking subsidiaries.

Interstate Banking and Branching

The Riegle-Neal Act enacted in 1994 permits an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company, with Federal Reserve Board approval, to
acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding company’s home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law. In addition, national banks and state banks with different home states are
permitted to merge across state lines, with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, unless the home state of a participating banking institution passed legislation prior to June 1, 1997 that expressly prohibits interstate
mergers. De novo interstate branching is permitted if the laws of the host state so authorize. Thrift institutions (like Northern Trust Bank, FSB) may freely engage in de novo branching on an interstate basis. Moreover, national banks, such as
Northern Trust, NA, may provide trust services in any state to the same extent as a trust company chartered by that state.

Community Reinvestment Act

The Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The CRA and the regulations issued
thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. These regulations also provide for
regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. The
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 requires federal banking agencies to make public a rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance record of its bank
subsidiaries is reviewed by federal banking agencies in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or thrift or to merge with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory record
can substantially delay or block the transaction. Each of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries, including the Bank, received at least a satisfactory CRA rating from its regulator in its most recent CRA examination.

In addition, the GLBA requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups that relate to the CRA, and contains various other provisions
designed to improve the delivery of financial services to consumers while maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial services industry.



Privacy and Security

The GLBA also establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by, among other provisions, requiring banks to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth
certain rules with respect to the disclosure to third parties of consumer information. The Corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to the GLBA. Regulations adopted under the GLBA set standards for protecting the
security, confidentiality and integrity of customer information, and require notice to regulators, and in some cases, to customers, in the event of security breaches. A number of states have adopted their own statutes requiring notification of
security breaches.

Consumer Laws and Regulations

In addition to the laws and regulations discussed above, the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions
with banks. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain
disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers and monitor account activity when taking deposits, making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such customers. Failure to
comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties, operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution.

Future Legislation

Various legislation is from time to time introduced in Congress and state legislatures with respect to
the regulation of financial institutions. Such legislation may change the banking statutes and the operating environment of the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. The Corporation cannot determine the
ultimate effect that potential legislation, or implementing regulations, if enacted, would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Corporation or its banking subsidiaries.

Item 1A—Risk Factors

From an investor’s standpoint, public companies in general and financial
institutions in particular share many of the same risks. However, each company’s unique combination of strategies, markets served, product and service offerings, processes and systems, and other internal and external factors cause it to have
its own set of principal risks. Following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in Northern Trust’s business. We manage these risks through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls, and
our ability to continue to successfully identify and manage significant risks is itself a risk factor.

Economic, Market, and Monetary Policy Risks

Northern Trust carries on a global business. Northern Trust’s businesses are affected by conditions in the global financial markets
and general economic conditions both in the U.S. and internationally. Factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices, the overall pace of capital markets activities, interest rates, currency exchange rates, investor sentiment
and inflation can affect our results. For example, a downturn in economic conditions can affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans, causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit, a higher level of charge-offs,
and higher provision for credit losses. In addition, Northern Trust believes it has profited from the increasing globalization of investment activity and from pension reform in many nations that has generated new pools of assets that require
management and servicing. Any slowing of this globalization or other such trends would adversely affect factors that



have been important in Northern Trust’s recent growth. Northern Trust’s expanding business activities in emerging markets also presents the risks
inherent in conducting these activities in less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments.

The fees we earn for
managing and servicing our customers’ assets are also affected by general economic conditions. For example, changes in U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates, equity market valuations, or debt market valuations as a result of market disruption or
illiquidity could affect the valuations of the third-party assets we manage or service. This can affect Northern Trust’s earnings since a significant part of the fees we earn is based on asset values. Economic conditions also affect wealth
creation, investment preferences, trading activities, and savings patterns, which impact demand for the Corporation’s trust and investment products and services.

The direction and level of interest rates also are important factors, since falling rates or rates that remain very low can reduce our net interest margin — the difference between the yield we earn on our assets
and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. This, in turn, could negatively impact our net interest income and earnings. Conditions in particular markets, including matters such as currency volatility, the level of
cross-border investing activity, and the demand for borrowed securities, can affect Northern Trust’s earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending. In addition, transaction volumes can impact Northern
Trust’s earnings and may vary with economic conditions.

Our businesses and earnings also are affected by the monetary and other
policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities or central banks of the United States, non-U.S. governments and international agencies. For example, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and
credit in the United States, and its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board also can affect the value of financial
instruments we hold, and its policies also can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans.

Operational Risks

In our asset servicing, investment management, and other business activities, Northern Trust effects or
processes transactions for clients that involve very large amounts of money. Many factors can impact operations and expose us to risks that may vary in size, scale and scope, including human errors or omissions, defects or interruptions in computer
or communications systems, breakdowns in processes, internal controls or operational infrastructure, unsuccessful or difficult implementation of systems upgrades, defects in product design or delivery, negative developments in relationships with
third parties or key employees or associates in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, as well as external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as natural disasters, epidemics, computer viruses, or terrorist events. Our
necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions may increase the risk that system flaws or human tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. Additionally, given the
high volume of transactions processed by the Corporation, errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified. In recent years, we have expanded the operational support located in lower—cost areas, where the nature of
the infrastructure to support such activities presents greater challenges. Our business continuity plans address many of these risks, but must operate successfully to mitigate them.

Investment Performance, Fiduciary, and Asset Servicing Risks

Revenues from our investment
management, fiduciary, and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings. Generating risk-adjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes is important to maintaining existing business and attracting new business.
Managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is also important to client satisfaction. Failure to do so can generate liability, as can failure to manage the differing
interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities or the failure to manage these risks adequately. In addition, we may find it necessary to take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the
usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of rating changes, liquidity or valuation issues or other developments, even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing investments. These risks are
accentuated when credit or equity markets are particularly volatile or when the liquidity in markets is disrupted.

Credit Risks

A number of Northern Trust’s product offerings involve credit risk, including loans, leases, and other lending commitments. We allow for and reserve
against credit risks based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). This process requires us to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments. Challenges associated with our
credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessment and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors. Credit risk levels can also be affected by the strength of the economy in general and in the particular
locales in which we extend credit, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced



demand for credit and adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of borrowers which could impact the borrowers’ ability to repay
outstanding loans. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Provision and Reserve for Credit Losses” in the 2007 Financial Annual Report to
Stockholders (pages 30—32).

Liquidity Risks

Northern Trust depends on access to capital markets to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our
clients. Events or circumstances, such as a loss of confidence of debt purchasers, depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets generally or in transactions with Northern Trust, disruption in the market for debt-related
securities, or a significant downgrade of our debt rating, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations” captioned “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the 2007 Financial Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 22—24).

Holding Company Risks

The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries and
it relies primarily on dividends from these subsidiaries to meet its obligations and to pay dividends. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank and the other subsidiaries can supply funds to the Corporation by dividend or
otherwise. If the Bank or the other subsidiaries of the Corporation were unable to supply the Corporation with funds over time, it could be unable to meet its various obligations. See “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1 of this
report.

Regulation Risks

Virtually
every aspect of Northern Trust’s business around the world is regulated, generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions. In the United States, the Corporation, the Bank, and many of its
other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. These regulations, which cover a broad range of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities, are specifically directed at
protecting depositors, the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. The Corporation and its nonbanking subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by securities regulators, domestically and internationally.

Regulatory violations could generate penalties, require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business, result in
limitations on our ability to conduct business or restrict our ability to expand or adversely impact our reputation. Laws, regulations, and their interpretation by regulatory agencies may change or generate enhanced scrutiny of particular activities
at any time. Those changes or enhanced emphasis can impose costs or otherwise affect our ability to compete successfully. In particular, evolving regulations, such as the new Basel II capital regime, and regulations that generate increased scrutiny,
such as anti-money laundering procedures, can require significant time, effort, and resources on our part to ensure compliance in a rapidly changing environment. New or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance may have unforeseen or
unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry, including Northern Trust. Additionally, failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies could adversely affect proposed acquisitions, other business opportunities and
results of operations. See “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1 of this report.

Litigation Risks

Our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us, claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise breached a duty
owed to them. Our trust, custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk. Cases of this kind can involve substantial claims and be expensive to defend. We estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened
claims, and accrue reserves when appropriate, by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations. This process is subject to the risk that a judge or jury could decide a case
contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts, and to the risk that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case.

Tax and Accounting Risks

In the course of its business, Northern Trust is sometimes subject to challenges from U.S. and
non-U.S. tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. In recent years, the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service has proposed to disallow tax deductions related to certain types of structured leasing transactions, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Additionally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board makes
pronouncements and



adjustments to its existing accounting guidance that may impact the manner in which the Corporation accounts for certain of its transactions.

Strategic and Competitive Risks

We have grown
through a combination of internal expansion and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities, and we intend to continue to do so. Failure to integrate a substantial acquisition would have an adverse effect on our business, as would the
failure to execute successfully a significant internal expansion. The challenges arising from the integration of an acquired business or significant expansion of an existing business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees,
clients, suppliers, and other business partners, as well as combining accounting, data processing and internal control systems. Our growth also depends upon successful, consistent execution of our business strategies in both PFS and C&IS, and a
failure to do so could negatively impact growth.

We provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive
markets, in which pricing can be a key competitive factor. Merger activity in the financial services industry continues to produce large, well-capitalized, and geographically-diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial
products and services at competitive prices. In certain businesses, such as foreign exchange trading, electronic networks present a competitive challenge. Additionally, technological advances and the growth of internet-based commerce have made it
possible for non-depository institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business. Many of these non-traditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost
structures.

Our success in this competitive environment requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation. This
investment is directed at generating new products and services, and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace. Among other things, this helps us maintain a mix of products and services that
keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins, an important strategic goal. This investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or additional business
from existing clients, and includes investment in technological innovation as well. Falling behind our competition in any of these areas could adversely affect our business opportunities and growth. Our success in controlling the costs and expenses
of our business operations also impacts operating results. Another goal of innovation, as a part of our business strategy, is to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses, including the costs of losses
associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets.

Reputation Risks

An important reason that clients bring their business to Northern Trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics,
performance, accuracy, and compliance. Damage to our reputation for delivery of this high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them. Damage to our reputation also could affect the
confidence of counterparties, rating agencies, and stockholders in Northern Trust, and ultimately affect our ability to manage our balance sheet or effect transactions. The maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in controlling
or mitigating the various risks described above, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in such areas as: potential conflicts of interest and other ethical issues; anti-money laundering and
anti-terrorist financing procedures; customer personal information and privacy issues; data security; record-keeping; regulatory investigations of Northern Trust or within the banking industry; and any litigation that arises from the failure or
perceived failure of Northern Trust to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

Many of the risks described above are discussed in
more detail in the sections of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Risk Management,” “Market Risk Management,” and “Operational Risk
Management” in the 2007 Financial Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 24—34), in the section of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2007 Financial Annual Report to Stockholders captioned “Note 25,
Contingent Liabilities” (pages 66—67), and in the sections of “Item 1 – Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K captioned “Government Monetary and Fiscal Policies,” “Competition” and “Regulation
and Supervision” (pages 3—11).

Additionally, the risks described above may cause actual results to differ from the
Corporation’s current expectations of future events or future results indicated in what are considered “forward-looking statements” of the Corporation. Forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results are also
discussed in the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Factors Affecting Future Results” in the 2007 Financial Annual Report to Stockholders (pages
34—35).

Item 1B—Unresolved Staff Comments

None.



Item 2—Properties

The executive offices of the Corporation and the Bank are located at 50 South
LaSalle Street in Chicago. This Bank-owned building is occupied by various divisions of Northern Trust’s business units. Financial services are provided by the Bank at this location. Adjacent to this building are two office buildings in which
the Bank leases approximately 432,000 square feet of space principally for staff divisions of the business units. Financial services are also provided by the Bank at 18 other Chicago metropolitan area locations, seven of which are owned and 11 of
which are leased. The Bank’s operations are located in a 555,000 square foot facility at 801 South Canal Street in Chicago and its computer data center is located in a 405,000 square foot facility at 840 South Canal Street in Chicago, with
supplementary operations/data center space of 65,000 square feet located in the western suburbs of Chicago. All of these facilities, as well as space for the Bank’s London and Singapore branches, Edge Act subsidiary, and The Northern Trust
Company, Canada are leased. A majority of the Bank’s London-based staff is located at Canary Wharf in London, where 188,000 square feet of office space is leased. The Corporation’s other subsidiaries operate from 83 locations, 11 of which
are owned and 72 of which are leased. In addition to the above-referenced properties, subsidiaries of the Corporation maintain a number of small operations classified as retirement home/limited access banking locations, back offices or executive
suites.

The Corporation believes that its owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for its business needs. For additional
information relating to properties and lease commitments, refer to Note 8 titled “Buildings and Equipment” and Note 9 titled “Lease Commitments” on pages 50—51 of the Corporation’s Financial Annual Report to
Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2007, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 3—Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are
routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and threatened legal actions, including, but not limited to, actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants, regulatory matters, employment matters, and challenges from tax
authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. In certain of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages or adjustments to recorded tax liabilities are asserted. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome
of such matters, particularly matters that will be decided by a jury and actions that seek very large damages based on novel and complex damage and liability legal theories or that involve a large number of parties, the Corporation cannot state with
confidence the eventual outcome of these matters or the timing of their ultimate resolution, or estimate the possible loss or range of loss associated with them; however, based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel,
management does not believe that judgments or settlements in excess of amounts already reserved, if any, arising from pending or threatened legal actions, regulatory matters, employment matters, or challenges from tax authorities, either
individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation, although they could have a material adverse effect on operating results for a particular period.

As part of its audit of federal tax returns filed from 1997 – 2000, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) challenged the
Corporation’s tax position with respect to thirteen investments made in structured leasing transactions and proposed to disallow certain tax deductions and assess related interest and penalties. During the second quarter of 2005, the IRS issued
a revised examination report that continued to disallow certain tax deductions and included additional proposed adjustments to income and penalty assessments. The Corporation anticipates that the IRS will continue to disallow deductions relating to
these leases and possibly include other lease transactions with similar characteristics as part of its audit of tax returns filed after 2000. In October 2005, the IRS Tax Appeals Division informed the Corporation that the Criminal Investigation
Division of the IRS had initiated an investigation relating to structured leasing transactions in which the Corporation had participated. The Corporation was informed in February 2007 that the IRS, without a recommendation for prosecution, referred
this matter to the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois for further investigation through the grand jury process. The Corporation has been advised by the government that it is not a target of the investigation.
The Corporation is cooperating fully in the investigation. The Corporation does not know the full scope of the investigation and cannot predict at this time the impact of the investigation or when or on what basis the investigation will be resolved.
The Corporation believes that these transactions are valid leases for U.S. tax purposes and that its tax treatment of these transactions is appropriate based on its interpretation of the tax regulations and legal precedents; a court or other
judicial authority, however, could disagree. The Corporation believes it has appropriate reserves to cover its tax liabilities, including liabilities related to structured leasing transactions, and related interest and penalties. The Corporation
will continue to defend its position on the tax treatment of the leases vigorously.

Item 4—Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

None.
