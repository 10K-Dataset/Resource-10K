2019 Annual Report | Northern Trust Corporation


PART I

ITEM 1 – BUSINESS

Northern Trust Corporation

Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking solutions to corporations, institutions, families and individuals. The Corporation is a financial holding company conducting business through various U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, including The Northern Trust Company (Bank).

The Bank is an Illinois banking corporation headquartered in Chicago and the Corporation’s principal subsidiary. Founded in 1889, the Bank conducts its business through its U.S. operations and its various U.S. and non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries. At

December 31, 2019

$11.1 billion

.

The Corporation expects that the Bank will continue in the foreseeable future to be the major source of the Corporation’s consolidated assets, revenues, and net income. Except where the context otherwise requires, references to “Northern Trust,” “we,” “us,” “our,” "its," or similar terms mean Northern Trust Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

Business Overview

Northern Trust focuses on managing and servicing client assets through its two client-focused reporting segments: Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C&IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to C&IS and Wealth Management. Northern Trust reports certain income and expense items not allocated to C&IS and Wealth Management in a third reporting segment, Treasury and Other.

CORPORATE & INSTITUTIONAL SERVICES

C&IS is a leading global provider of asset servicing and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors around the globe. Asset servicing and related services encompass a full range of capabilities including, but not limited to: custody; fund administration; investment operations outsourcing; investment management; investment risk and analytical services; employee benefit services; securities lending; foreign exchange; treasury management; brokerage services; transition management services; banking; and cash management. Client relationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support from locations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region. At

December 31, 2019

, total C&IS assets under custody/administration, assets under custody, and assets under management were

$11.31 trillion

,

$8.50 trillion

, and

$917.5 billion

, respectively.

WEALTH MANAGEMENT

Wealth Management focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. The business also includes the Global Family Office, which provides customized services to meet the complex financial needs of individuals and family offices in the United States and throughout the world with assets typically exceeding $200 million. In supporting these targeted segments, Wealth Management provides trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services; financial consulting; guardianship and estate administration; family business consulting; family financial education; brokerage services; and private and business banking.

Wealth Management is one of the largest providers of advisory services in the United States, with assets under custody/administration, assets under custody, and assets under management of

$738.8 billion

,

$735.7 billion

, and

$313.8 billion

, respectively, at

December 31, 2019

. Wealth Management services are delivered by multidisciplinary teams through a network of offices in 19 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., as well as offices in London, Guernsey, and Abu Dhabi.

ASSET MANAGEMENT

Asset Management, through the Corporation’s various subsidiaries, supports the C&IS and Wealth Management reporting segments by providing a broad range of asset management and related services and other products to clients around the world. Investment solutions are delivered through separately managed accounts, bank common and collective funds, registered investment companies, exchange traded funds, non-U.S. collective investment funds, and unregistered private investment funds. Asset Management’s capabilities include active and passive equity; active and passive fixed income; cash management; alternative asset classes (such as private equity and hedge funds of funds); and multi-manager advisory services and products.

December 31, 2019

, including

$917.5 billion

for C&IS clients and

$313.8 billion

for Wealth Management clients.

Competition

Northern Trust faces intense competition in all aspects and areas of its business. Competition comes from both regulated and unregulated financial services organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and global markets in which Northern Trust conducts operations. Our competitors include a broad range of financial institutions and service companies, including other custodial banks, deposit-taking institutions, asset management firms, benefits consultants, trust companies, investment banking firms, insurance companies, investment counseling firms, and various financial technology companies, including software providers and data services firms. As our businesses grow and markets evolve, we may encounter increasing and new forms of competition around the world.

Northern Trust’s business strategy is to provide quality financial services to targeted market segments in which it believes it has a competitive advantage and favorable growth prospects. As part of this strategy, Northern Trust seeks to differentiate itself from its competitors with premier, holistic solutions and exceptional experiences tailored to meet clients’ needs. In addition, Northern Trust emphasizes the development and growth of recurring sources of fee-based income and continual productivity improvements. Northern Trust also seeks to maintain its foundational strength with a strong, conservative balance sheet and a globally respected brand.

Economic Conditions And Government Policies

The earnings of Northern Trust are affected by numerous external influences. Chief among these are general economic conditions, both domestic and international, and actions that governments and their central banks take in managing their economies. These general conditions affect all of Northern Trust’s businesses, as well as the quality, value, and profitability of its loan and investment portfolios.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) implements monetary policy through its open market operations in United States Government securities, its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from Federal Reserve Banks, and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits. The policies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board directly affect interest rates and therefore what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds.

Supervision and Regulation

Northern Trust is subject to extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the United States and in each of the jurisdictions in which it does business. The discussion below outlines significant elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Northern Trust. Changes in laws or regulations applicable to Northern Trust may have a material effect on its businesses and results of operations.

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION

Under U.S. law, the Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company subject to the supervision, examination, and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. A financial holding company is permitted to engage in a broader range of financial activities than a bank holding company. To maintain the Corporation’s status as a financial holding company, the Bank and the Corporation must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed,” and the Bank must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) examination. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements may result in restrictions on the Corporation’s ability to exercise powers granted to financial holding companies, to engage in new activities, to continue current activities, or to make acquisitions.

SUBSIDIARY REGULATION

The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and is subject to regulation by both agencies. As an Illinois banking corporation, the Bank is also subject to Illinois state laws and regulations and to examination and supervision by the Division of Banking of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. The Bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the Federal Reserve Board and is registered provisionally as a swap dealer with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under the Commodity Exchange Act. As a result, the Bank is subject to supervision, examination and enforcement by certain other regulatory bodies, including the CFTC and the National Futures Association (NFA).

The Corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board and, in certain circumstances, other functional regulators. The Corporation’s broker-dealer subsidiary is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a broker-dealer, investment adviser, and municipal securities dealer, and is subject to the rules and regulations of these bodies. Certain


nonbanking affiliates are registered with the CFTC as commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators and subject to supervision and regulation by the CFTC and NFA. Other subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered with the SEC as investment advisers and are subject to regulation by the SEC. Subsidiaries may also be regulated by state regulators in various states.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT, AS AMENDED

In May 2018, the U.S. Congress passed, and the President signed, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the Regulatory Relief Act), which amended parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and directed the Federal Reserve Board and other federal regulators to revise parts of their regulations that implement the Dodd-Frank Act. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve Board and other federal regulators finalized the revisions required by the Regulatory Relief Act. The following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as implemented through final rules promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board and other agencies and amended by the Regulatory Relief Act, most relevant to the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including the Bank.

Enhanced Prudential Standards.

The Dodd-Frank Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve Board through various rulemakings and amended by the Regulatory Relief Act, generally imposes enhanced prudential requirements on U.S. bank holding companies with at least $100 billion in total consolidated assets, including the Corporation. The enhanced prudential standards include more stringent risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements and single counterparty credit limits for large bank holding companies, including the Corporation. The Federal Reserve Board also has the discretion to require these large U.S. bank holding companies to limit their short-term debt, to issue contingent capital instruments, and to provide enhanced public disclosures.

In October 2019, the Federal Reserve Board finalized a proposed rule implementing changes made by the Regulatory Relief Act. This rule introduced a new four-category framework to determine which enhanced prudential standards and other requirements are applicable to institutions with total consolidated assets of at least $100 billion, based on asset thresholds and other risk-based factors. Under the new rules, the Corporation is classified as a Category II institution.

The requirements under the new framework that apply to the Corporation are largely unchanged as a result of the Federal Reserve Board’s final tailoring rule for enhanced prudential standards. The Corporation must submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve Board, conduct supervisory and internal periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy in adverse economic conditions, maintain enhanced risk management procedures, comply with a liquidity risk management framework (discussed below in “Liquidity Standards”) and aggregate credit exposure limits, conduct liquidity stress tests, and hold a buffer of liquid assets estimated to meet funding needs during a financial stress event. The Corporation is not subject to the total loss-absorbing capacity requirement, capital surcharge, enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, or aggregate credit exposure limit that apply to U.S. bank holding companies that are global systemically important bank holding companies.

Resolution Planning.

As required by Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Corporation is required to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. In addition, under an FDIC rule (the CIDI Resolution Plan Rule) the Bank must submit to the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of its failure. The Corporation is required to submit its next Section 165(d) resolution plan by July 1, 2021. The FDIC has indicated that the Bank is not required to submit a resolution plan under the CIDI Resolution Plan Rule before the conclusion of a rulemaking regarding the CIDI Resolution Plan Rule requirements.

On March 24, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC provided joint written feedback to the Corporation regarding the resolution plan submitted by the Corporation in December 2015 pursuant to Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act (the 2015 165(d) Plan). The joint written feedback identified certain “shortcomings” in the Corporation’s 2015 165(d) Plan. While the identification of these shortcomings is different from a determination that the plan is not “credible,” the Corporation was required to address the shortcomings in a satisfactory manner in the Corporation’s resolution plan submitted to the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC in December 2017 (the 2017 165(d) Plan). On March 29, 2019, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC jointly announced that they did not identify shortcomings or deficiencies in the 2017 165(d) Plan.

In addition, on June 27, 2018, the Bank submitted its resolution plan (the 2018 CIDI Plan) to the FDIC under the CIDI Resolution Plan Rule. To date, no formal written feedback or guidance has been received regarding the 2018 CIDI Plan.

Separately, the European Union Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), was adopted for European Union credit institutions, including certain of the Bank’s subsidiaries and branches, effective January 1, 2015. In accordance with applicable Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) guidance, a Simplified Recovery Plan for Northern Trust Global Services SE, a Luxembourg-registered indirect subsidiary of the Bank, has been established and will be reviewed and filed with the CSSF at least biennially. CSSF regulations also require institutions to submit resolution related data on an annual basis, a requirement for which Northern Trust Global Services SE has an established process.

Orderly Liquidation Authority.

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, such as the Corporation and certain of its covered subsidiaries, can be subjected to an orderly liquidation authority if in default or danger of default and their resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States,


among other requirements set by statute. If the Corporation were subject to orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would be appointed as its receiver, which would give the FDIC considerable powers to resolve the Corporation. Absent such actions, the Corporation, as a bank holding company, would remain subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

The Volcker Rule

. The Volcker Rule bans proprietary trading subject to exceptions for market-making, hedging, certain trading activities in U.S. and foreign sovereign debt, certain trading activities of non-U.S. banking entities trading outside the United States, certain customer-driven matched swaps, and trading activities related to liquidity management. The Volcker Rule also imposes significant restrictions on sponsoring or investing in certain “covered funds,” such as hedge funds or private equity funds, again subject to exceptions. Northern Trust maintains an enterprise-wide compliance program to comply with the Volcker Rule.

Swaps and Other Derivatives.

The Dodd-Frank Act imposed a regulatory structure on the over-the-counter derivatives market, including requirements for clearing, exchange trading, capital, margin, trade reporting, and recordkeeping. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires certain entities to register as a “major swap participant,” a “swap dealer,” a “major-security-based swap participant” or a “security-based swap dealer.” The Bank’s activities as a swap dealer are subject to the CFTC’s rules and regulations, including rules regarding internal and external business conduct standards, reporting and recordkeeping, mandatory clearing for certain swaps, trade documentation and confirmation requirements, and cross-border swap activities. The Bank is also subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations regarding mandatory posting and collection of margin by certain swap counterparties. The SEC’s rules related to security-based swaps are not currently applicable to the Bank’s swap-dealing activity and the Bank’s current trading activity does not mandate its regulation as a security-based swap dealer.

HOLDING COMPANY SUPPORT UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT

The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to obligate the Federal Reserve Board to require bank holding companies, such as the Corporation, to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution. Under this requirement, the Corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should the Bank experience financial distress.

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS

The Corporation may pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed without objection by the Federal Reserve Board. Dividends from the Bank are a significant source of funds for the Corporation, and the Corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock therefore depends on the ability of the Bank to pay sufficient dividends to the Corporation.

Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank to the Corporation without regulatory consent. The Bank may not pay any dividends if it is undercapitalized, or if the payment of the dividend would cause it to become undercapitalized. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid in a calendar year is limited to its “recent earnings” (the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years), or its “undivided profits” (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus), whichever is less. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Corporation may also be affected by the capital adequacy standards applicable to the Bank (discussed further below), which include minimum requirements and buffers.

CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING

The Corporation’s capital distributions are subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s capital plan rules, which require the Corporation to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve Board for review. The Corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan to which the Federal Reserve Board has not objected.

The major components of that oversight are the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act stress tests (DFAST). These requirements involve both company-run and supervisory-run testing of capital under various scenarios, including baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator. Results from the Corporation’s and the Bank’s annual company-run stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and made publicly available.

The Corporation submitted its most recent capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board in April 2019 as part of the Federal Reserve Board’s 2019 CCAR exercise, and the Federal Reserve Board did not object to the Corporation’s plan and proposed capital actions, including authority to increase its dividend payments and share repurchases, in mid-2019.

The Regulatory Relief Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s tailoring rule implementing changes required by such act did not directly affect the CCAR exercise or capital plan requirements that apply to the Corporation. The Corporation remains subject to annual company-run stress testing, annual supervisory stress testing, and annual capital plan submission requirements.


The Corporation will submit its 2020 capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board by April 6, 2020. The Federal Reserve Board is expected to publish either its objection or non-objection to the 2020 capital plan and proposed capital actions, such as dividend payments and share repurchases, in mid-2020.

Under the DFAST regulations, the Corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve Board annually. The Bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test (although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the Corporation). Results from the Corporation’s and the Bank’s annual company-run stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and made publicly available. Northern Trust published the results of its company-run stress tests on June 21, 2019, and the results of its company-run mid-cycle stress tests on October 31, 2019.

In April 2018, the Federal Reserve Board proposed revisions to the CCAR exercise and DFAST regulations that would in part integrate the forward-looking stress test results with the non-stress capital requirements discussed below by using the results of the annual supervisory stress test to set specific buffer requirements above minimum capital requirements, which restrict capital distributions under the capital rule and establish a single approach to capital distribution limitations. The April 2018 proposal also would replace the 2.5% capital conservation buffer requirement discussed below with a stress capital buffer requirement and establish a stress leverage buffer requirement in addition to the minimum 4% Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement. Under the April 2018 proposal, an institution would be required to maintain capital ratios above its minimum plus its buffer requirements in order to avoid restrictions on its capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. An institution would be bound by the most stringent distribution limitations, if any, as determined by its capital conservation buffer requirement, its stress leverage buffer requirement and, if applicable, its advanced approaches capital conservation buffer requirement and enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standard.

The April 2018 proposal also would remove the stress testing assumption that an institution would make all planned capital distributions over the planning horizon, including any planned common stock dividends and repurchases of common stock. Instead, the stress buffer requirements would include only four quarters of planned common stock dividends in order to preserve the incentives for an institution to engage in disciplined, forward-looking dividend planning. Further, the April 2018 proposal would adjust the methodology used in the supervisory stress test to assume that the institution takes actions to maintain a constant level of assets, including loans, trading assets, and securities over the planning horizon and assume that the institution’s risk-weighted assets and leverage ratio denominator generally remain unchanged over the planning horizon. The April 2018 proposal also would remove the quantitative objection in CCAR and eliminate the 30 percent dividend payout ratio as a criterion for heightened scrutiny of an institution's capital plan. The Federal Reserve Board would retain the CCAR qualitative supervisory review and the ability to object to an institution’s capital plan on qualitative grounds based on the adequacy of the institution’s capital planning processes for institutions supervised by the Large Institution Supervision Coordination Committee and other large and complex institutions.

As of the date of this filing, the Federal Reserve Board has not finalized the April 2018 proposal, and the Corporation cannot predict whether it will be finalized and whether such finalization would alter the way in which the CCAR exercise and DFAST regulations are applied to the Corporation.

CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS

The Corporation, as a bank holding company, is subject to risk-based and leverage capital guidelines implemented by the Federal Reserve Board that are based on industry-standard guidelines published by the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), known as Basel III. The Bank, as an FDIC-insured depository institution, is also required to meet risk-based and leverage capital guidelines established by regulators which are generally similar to those established by the Federal Reserve Board for bank holding companies.

Under the final Basel III rules, the Corporation, with the Bank, is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations that are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their risk-based capital ratios. The Corporation also is subject to a capital floor that is based on the Basel III standardized approach to calculating risk-based capital ratios. The Corporation is therefore required to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches, and is subject to the more stringent of the two in the assessment of its capital adequacy.


The Bank’s risk-based and leverage capital ratios at

December 31, 2019

, were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by U.S. banking regulators. The risk-based and leverage capital ratios for the Corporation and the Bank, together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “well-capitalized,” are provided in the following chart.

TABLE 1: RISK-BASED AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2019

Advanced approaches institutions, such as the Corporation and the Bank, are subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. Advanced approaches institutions that are insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, also must maintain at least a 3.0% supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “well-capitalized.” The Corporation and Bank are also subject to a capital conservation buffer, which requires them to hold a buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation. The minimum capital conservation buffer increased to 2.5% in 2019 from 1.875% in 2018.

A “countercyclical buffer” of 0% to 2.5% of a banking organization’s total risk-weighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations, such as the Corporation, is also a component of the capital adequacy framework. In general, the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures. The U.S. countercyclical buffer is currently set at 0%, but certain other jurisdictions in which the Corporation has credit exposures currently have countercyclical buffers set at levels greater than 0%, which slightly increase the weighted average countercyclical buffer to which the Corporation is subject.

As discussed above, in April 2018 the Federal Reserve Board proposed revisions to the Basel III rules that would in part integrate the forward-looking stress test results with the non-stress capital requirements discussed in this section. If implemented, the revisions would establish revised capital requirements for large banking organizations, such as the Corporation, that are institution-specific and risk-sensitive.

LIQUIDITY STANDARDS

Northern Trust is subject to the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement, which is designed to ensure that covered banking organizations including the Corporation and the Bank maintain an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to their expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon under a regulatorily prescribed liquidity stress scenario. As of

December 31, 2019

, the Corporation and the Bank were in compliance with applicable LCR requirements.

Basel III also introduced the concept of a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirement, designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. The NSFR will require certain banking organizations, including the Corporation, to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance-sheet activities. The Federal Reserve Board has proposed, but has not adopted, a final rule implementing the NSFR.

The enhanced prudential standards imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the Regulatory Reform Act, specify certain required liquidity risk management practices for large bank holding companies and banks. The Federal Reserve Board’s October 2019 final tailoring rule targets certain aspects of these requirements based on banking organizations’ business model and risk profile, as delineated into four risk-based categories. The Corporation, a Category II institution under the final tailoring rule, is subject to the liquidity risk management, monthly liquidity stress testing, liquidity buffer, and daily liquidity reporting requirements.


PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION

Federal banking regulators are required to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, and are also authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company of an under-capitalized banking subsidiary. In certain instances, the Corporation could be required to guarantee the performance of a capital restoration plan for the Bank if it were under-capitalized.

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

The Bank is subject to restrictions governing transactions between it and affiliated entities, including the Corporation, its affiliates, and its subsidiaries. These transactions must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be, offered to nonaffiliated companies (i.e., on terms not less favorable to the Bank than market terms). Further, extensions of credit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral and are limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus for transactions with a single affiliate and to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus for transactions with all affiliates.

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING, ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION, AND OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL

The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and implemented in the regulation of the federal banking regulators and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which contain anti-money laundering (AML) and financial transparency requirements for conducting due diligence, verifying client and beneficial owner identification, and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities. AML laws outside the United States contain similar requirements.

Various legal requirements prohibit Northern Trust entities from engaging in business in or with certain jurisdictions and parties, such as organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts. The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control publishes lists of these prohibited parties, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If the Corporation or the Bank finds a sanctioned name or jurisdiction on any transaction or account, the Corporation or the Bank must reject or block such account or transaction and notify the appropriate authorities.

Failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions or difficulties in obtaining approvals, restrictions on their business activities or harm to reputation. Many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the Corporation’s non-U.S. offices. The Corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations.

DEPOSIT INSURANCE AND ASSESSMENTS

The Bank accepts deposits, and eligible deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limit, which is currently $250,000 for each depositor account. Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition, or has violated laws, regulations, or orders from a regulatory agency. Certain liquid assets are excluded from the deposit insurance assessment base of custody banks that satisfy certain institutional eligibility criteria. This has the effect of reducing the amount of deposit insurance fund insurance premiums payable by custody banks. The Bank qualifies as a custody bank for this purpose.

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT

The Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. The Bank fulfills its CRA obligations by making qualified investments for the purposes of community development. The Bank received an “outstanding” CRA rating from the Federal Reserve Board in its most recent CRA examination.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY

Federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by, among other provisions, requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information, setting limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information, setting standards for protecting client information, and requiring notice of data breaches in certain circumstances. Most states, the European Union (EU) and other non-U.S. jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes and/or regulations concerning data privacy and security and requiring notification of data breaches. For example, a European data protection framework - the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - was adopted on April 8, 2016, and became effective in all European Economic Area (EEA) member states on May 25, 2018. GDPR is designed to harmonize data privacy laws across the EEA, to protect EEA citizens’ data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. GDPR has extraterritorial effect as its scope includes all data controllers and processors outside the EEA whose processing activities relate to the offering of goods or services to, or monitoring the behavior of, EEA individuals. Organizations that violate certain provisions of GDPR could be fined up to €20 million or 4% of their annual worldwide


revenue for the preceding fiscal year, whichever is greater. In the United States, the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) was adopted by the State of California and became effective January 1, 2020.  The CCPA substantially increases the rights of California residents to understand how their personal data is collected and used by commercial businesses. The CCPA includes a private right of action (permitting lawsuits to be brought by private individuals instead of the state Attorney General or other government actor for breaches), and contemplates civil penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation and up to $7,500 for each intentional violation.

The Corporation has adopted and disseminated privacy policies and communicates required information relating to financial privacy and data security in accordance with applicable law.

CONSUMER LAWS AND REGULATIONS

The Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties, operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution. Consumer laws and regulations are enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and other federal and state regulators.

NON-U.S. REGULATION

Northern Trust is subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which its non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries operate. For example, branches and subsidiaries conducting banking and asset servicing businesses in the United Kingdom are authorized to do so pursuant to the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. They are authorized by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and regulated by the FCA and, in some instances, also the PRA. The PRA and FCA exercise broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to revoke temporarily or permanently authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations, suspend registered employees, and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees.

Northern Trust’s European branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the EU and the member states in which they are domiciled. For example, with the establishment of Northern Trust Global Services SE as an EU-domiciled credit institution in Luxembourg in connection with the Corporation's Brexit-related planning, such entity is  subject to the prudential supervision of the European Central Bank and the CSSF. Moreover, Northern Trust’s non-European branches and subsidiaries conducting financial services activities also may be within the scope of the laws of the EU, given that some EU laws apply to the wider EEA, which includes not only all EU member states but also the non-EU member states Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and because of increasing extraterritorial effect of European legislation.

The following items provide a brief description of certain recently implemented and in-progress regulatory changes in the EU and United Kingdom relevant to the Corporation and its subsidiaries, in addition to the BRRD and GDPR discussed under “The Dodd-Frank Act, as Amended—Resolution Planning” and “Privacy and Security,” respectively, above.

Revised Capital Requirements Directive and revised Capital Requirements Regulation.

The EU Capital Requirements Directive of June 26, 2013 (CRD) and the EU Capital Requirements Regulation of June 26, 2013 (CRR) govern the legal framework for banking regulation in the EU, including, among other things, own fund requirements. On November 23, 2016, the EU Commission published a proposal for a revision of the CRD (CRD V) and the CRR (CRR II). Formal adoption of CRD V and CRR II by the EU Parliament and European Council has not yet occurred. Further, CRD V and CRR II currently contain mandates for the European Banking Authority (EBA) to produce a number of regulatory technical standards (RTS) and implementing technical standards (ITS), which remain under development.

Central Securities Depositories Regulation.

On September 17, 2014, the EU Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) entered into force (subject to a number of transitional provisions). The CSDR aims principally to ensure that transactions between buyers and sellers of dematerialized securities are settled in a safe and timely manner by introducing common securities settlement standards across the EU. CSDR requires several “Level 2” (or implementing) measures in order for its provisions to take effect fully. A number of these “Level 2” measures were published in 2017. Most recently, on September 13, 2018, the EU Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1229 supplementing the CSDR with regard to technical standards on settlement discipline was published in the EU’s Official Journal. The Delegated Regulation, which is expected to enter into force on February 1, 2021, sets out measures to prevent and address failed settlements and encourage settlement discipline by monitoring failed settlements, collecting and distributing cash penalties for failed settlements, and specifying the operational details of the buy-in process.

Securities Financing Transactions and Reuse of Collateral Regulation.

On November 25, 2015, the EU adopted a regulation on securities financing transactions and reuse of collateral (SFTR) as part of its approach to addressing shadow banking. The regulation includes provisions for enhanced transparency and reporting of securities financing transactions. The SFTR entered into force on January 12, 2016, subject to certain transitional provisions. SFTR requires adoption of certain “Level 2” measures which were finalized in 2019.


UK Criminal Finances Act

. On September 30, 2017, the UK Criminal Finances Act (CFA) entered into force. The CFA has extra-territorial effect, introducing certain new corporate criminal offenses in circumstances where a corporate entity or partnership (a relevant body) fails to prevent an “associated person” (broadly meaning an employee, agent or person who performs services for or on behalf of the relevant body) from criminally facilitating the evasion of tax, whether the tax evaded is owed (i) in the United Kingdom or (ii) in a foreign country if the relevant body has a nexus, or any conduct constituting part of the foreign tax evasion facilitation offense takes place, in the United Kingdom. These corporate offenses are strict liability offenses, such that in circumstances where an associated person of a relevant body criminally facilitates the evasion of tax and such relevant body has failed to prevent the associated person from committing such criminal facilitation of tax evasion, the relevant body will itself be guilty of a criminal offense carrying unlimited fines, unless it can show that it put in place reasonable prevention procedures (or by showing that it was not reasonable in all the circumstances to expect the relevant body to have any prevention procedures in place).

Benchmarks Regulation.

On January 1, 2018, the EU Benchmarks Regulation (BMR) became applicable in all EU member states, subject to certain transitional provisions. The principal objectives of the BMR are to restore investor confidence in the accuracy, robustness and integrity of indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, and the benchmark-setting process itself. The BMR aims to achieve these objectives by ensuring that benchmarks are not subject to conflicts of interest, are used appropriately, and reflect the actual market or economic reality they are intended to measure.

Market in Financial Instruments Directive.

On January 3, 2018, the recast Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) became applicable to investment services and activities in the EU. MiFID II, together with the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR I), repealed and recast the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004/39/EC) (MiFID). Going forward, MiFID II and MiFIR I form the EU legal framework governing the requirements applicable to investment firms, trading venues, data reporting service providers and third-country firms providing investment services or activities in the EU.

Money Market Funds Regulation.

On June 30, 2017, an EU regulation on money market funds (MMFR) with a view of making money market funds more resistant to crises and market turbulence was published. Subject to certain transitional provisions, the MMFR became applicable on July 21, 2018 for new money market funds and January 21, 2019 for existing money market funds. It imposes detailed rules relating to the investment policies, risk management and other operational aspects of such funds. Further “Level 2” regulations containing the technical implementation of the MMFR were published in 2018. Technical guidelines to clarify how to comply with certain reporting obligations under MMFR came into force on September 19, 2019.

European Deposit Insurance Scheme.

On October 11, 2017, the EU Commission announced that it aimed to complete all parts of the European Banking Union by 2018. The banking union is in place and operational except for the creation of a single European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS). The EDIS will apply to deposit guarantee schemes (DGSs) in EU member states participating in the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) and credit institutions in those member states. The EDIS will not directly affect member states that are not participating in the SSM, such as the United Kingdom, meaning that the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), the UK DGS, will not be subject to the EDIS. The EU Council and Parliament continue to consider the legislative proposal for the EDIS regulation, which was published by the EU Commission in November 2015. The EU Commission proposed changes to its approach to the EDIS in its October 2017 communication on completing the banking union but has not yet published any revisions to the text of the EDIS regulation to reflect these changes. The communication also urged the European Parliament and European Council to adopt these measures quickly to complete the banking union however this remains outstanding.

Fifth EU Money Laundering Directive.

On July 9, 2018, the Fifth EU Money Laundering Directive (MLD5) entered into force. MLD5 was required to be transposed into local law by EU member states by January 10, 2020 and introduces the following key changes to the current EU AML regime: (i) EU member states must ensure that registers of ultimate beneficial owners of companies and other legal entities become accessible to the general public; (ii) the current AML regime is extended to additional service providers, such as electronic wallet providers, virtual currency exchange service providers, and art dealers, and further specifications regarding the scope of application of MLD5 with respect to tax advisors and estate agents are provided; (iii) the threshold for identifying holders of prepaid cards is lowered to €150; and (iv) EU member states will be required to implement enhanced due diligence measures to monitor suspicious transactions involving high-risk countries more strictly.

Shareholder Rights Directive.

On May 17, 2017 the recast Shareholder Rights Directive (EU) 2017/828 was published (SRD II).  Member states of the EU were required to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Directive by June 10, 2019. SRD was designed to establish requirements in relation to the exercise of shareholder rights and, recognizing that shares are often held through complex chains of intermediaries, SRD II is designed to improve mechanisms for the identification of shareholders by companies, as well as improve the transmission of information along the chain of intermediaries to facilitate the exercise of shareholder rights. Non-EU intermediaries are


required to comply with the requirements if they provide services with respect to shares of companies that have their registered office in the EU. The EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1212 of September 3, 2018 set out minimum requirements for implementing SRD II, which will apply from September 3, 2020.

Depositary Books & Records.

Following the European Securities and Markets Authority’s opinion on asset segregation and application of depositary delegation rules to CSDs published on July 20, 2017, and entering into force on April 1, 2020, changes have been introduced by two EU regulations modifying the existing Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) and Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Level 2 Regulations: Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2018/1618 relating to the safe-keeping duties of depositaries of alternative investment funds and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2018/1619 relating to the safe-keeping duties of depositaries of UCITS. The changes aim to better define asset segregation requirements and to add additional safeguards, primarily focusing on information flow between the depositary and any third party to whom safe-keeping functions have been delegated.  The key changes (i) impact the frequency of reconciliations between the depositary’s internal accounts and records and those of any third party in the custody chain, (ii) require the depositary to maintain an independent record separate from the record maintained by the third party, and (iii) increase due diligence obligations where custody of assets is delegated to third parties outside of the EU.  The changes impact Northern Trust’s subsidiaries providing depositary services to European-domiciled fund clients.

In addition to the above, the Bank’s and the Corporation’s subsidiary banks located outside the United States are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of

December 31, 2019

, each of our non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements.

Staff

Northern Trust employed approximately

19,800

full-time equivalent staff members as of

December 31, 2019

ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS

In the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks. The following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to Northern Trust. Although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations, you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as: reducing the price of our common stock and other securities; reducing our capital, which can have regulatory and other consequences; affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us, with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses; and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers, which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the cost at which we are able to do so. Further, additional risks beyond those discussed below, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in other of our reports filed with, or furnished to, the SEC also could affect us adversely. We cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face.

These risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements” included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Market Risks

We are dependent on fee-based business for a majority of our revenues, which may be affected adversely by market volatility, a downturn in economic conditions, underperformance and/or negative trends in investment preferences.

Our principal operational focus is on fee-based business, which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interest-generating products and services. Fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management, custody or administration; the volume of transactions processed; securities lending volume and spreads; and fees for other services rendered, all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility, a downturn in economic conditions, underperformance and/or negative trends in investment preferences. For example, downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debt-related investments resulting from market disruption, illiquidity or other factors historically have reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others, which generally impacted our earnings negatively. Market volatility and/or weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation, investment preferences, trading activities, and savings patterns, which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide.

Our earnings also may be affected by poor investment returns or changes in investment preferences driven by factors beyond market volatility or weak economic conditions. For example, poor investment performance in funds or client accounts that we manage or in investment products that we design or provide that is due to underperformance relative to our competitors or benchmarks could result in declines in the market values of portfolios that we manage and/or administer and may affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients. Further, broader changes in investment preferences that lead to less investment in mutual funds or other collective funds, such as the shift in investor preference to lower fee products, could impact our earnings negatively.

Changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively.

The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. Interest rates generally remain low relative to historical levels. Low interest rate environments have had in the past, and may have in the future, a negative impact on our net interest margin, which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. Low interest rate environments also have historically had a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products. For example, in the past, we have from time to time waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to short-term interest rate levels and we may do so in the future if short-term interest rate levels decline. Low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings.

Conversely, in some circumstances, a rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively. For example, we may be impacted negatively if such an increase were to cause: market volatility and downturns in equity markets, resulting in a decrease in the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others, which generally impact our earnings negatively; our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return, resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions; our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments, resulting in increased credit costs, provisions for loan and lease losses and charge-offs; reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity, resulting in lower performance, yields and fees; a decline in the value of securities held in our portfolio of investment securities, resulting in decreased levels of capital and liquidity; or higher funding costs.


Further, although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks, if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect, these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective, which could impact earnings negatively.

Please see “Market Risk” in the “Risk Management” section included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face.

Changes in the monetary, trade and other policies of various regulatory authorities, central banks, governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively.

The monetary, trade and other policies of U.S. and international governments, agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on economic conditions and overall financial market performance. For example, the Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing, which are important factors in our earnings. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold. Further, their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available, which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us. Changes in monetary, trade and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict, and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The ultimate impact on us of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union remains uncertain.

In June 2016, United Kingdom (UK) voters approved a departure from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” Following delivery of the UK’s formal notice of withdrawal in March 2017, a subsequent negotiation period, and approval of a withdrawal agreement by each of the UK and the EU, the UK formally exited the EU on January 31, 2020. The ultimate impact of Brexit on the Corporation and the Bank remains uncertain and will depend on the final terms of the post-Brexit relationships negotiated between the UK and other EU nations. Brexit has contributed, and may continue to contribute, to market volatility, particularly the valuation of the Euro and British pound, and could have significant adverse effects on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. In conjunction with our Brexit-related preparations, and to mitigate the potential risk that our UK subsidiaries will be unable to retain their EU financial services “passports,” we have implemented certain changes to our organizational structure, including the establishment of an EU-domiciled credit institution in Luxembourg. We have incurred, and may in the future continue to incur, additional costs associated with such measures and unforeseen political, regulatory, or other developments related to Brexit, or operational issues associated with the organizational restructuring related thereto, also may result in additional costs and disruption to our EU banking business.

Uncertainty about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe, including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets, could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings.

Risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world. Foreign market and economic disruptions have affected, and may in the future affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, personal bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt, and home prices. Economic challenges faced in various foreign markets, including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions, or lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively.

Our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion, and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion, of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions. The value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio, which is generally determined based upon market values available from third-party sources, may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions. Declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity. Although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks, including hedging-related strategies, those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Accordingly, we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly.


Volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings.

We provide foreign exchange services to our clients, primarily in connection with our global custody business. Foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity. Foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income. Fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions, where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods. We also are exposed to non-trading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, and future non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expense.

We have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks, including hedging-related strategies. Any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively. Please see “Market Risk” in the “Risk Management” section included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face.

Changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively.

In past periods, reductions in the volatility of currency-trading markets, the level of cross-border investing activity, and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively. If these conditions occur in the future, our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively. In a few of our businesses, such as securities lending, our fee is calculated as a percentage of our client’s earnings, such that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues.

Operational Risks

Many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively.

We regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses. Despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk, our risk management program may not be effective in all cases. Factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size, scale and scope include:

•

failures of technological systems or breaches of security measures, including, but not limited to, those resulting from computer viruses or cyber-attacks;

•

human errors or omissions, including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures;

•

theft, fraud or misappropriation of assets, whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties;

•

defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems;

•

breakdowns in processes, over-reliance on manual processes, which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes, breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the systems and facilities that support our operations;

•

unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades;

•

defects in product design or delivery;

•

difficulty in accurately pricing assets, which can be aggravated by market volatility and illiquidity and lack of reliable pricing from third-party vendors;

•

negative developments in relationships with key counterparties, third-party vendors, employees or associates in our day-to-day operations; and

•

external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as natural disasters, pandemics, geopolitical events, political unrest or acts of terrorism.

While we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors, these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively. We also may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businesses—particularly as we expand our geographic footprint, product pipeline and client types—and consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion. If our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully, such factors may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions. We continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture, ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate for our role as a major financial institution. Nonetheless, if we fail to provide the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk, our business could be impacted adversely.


Failures of our technological systems or breaches of our security measures, including, but not limited to, those resulting from cyber-attacks, may result in losses.

Any failure, interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations. Our systems involve the use of clients’ and our proprietary and confidential information, and security breaches, including cyber-attacks, could expose us to a risk of theft, loss or other misappropriation of this information. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients’ proprietary and confidential information, resulting in theft, loss or other misappropriation of this information. Regulators globally are also introducing the potential for greater monetary fines on institutions that suffer from breaches leading to the theft, loss or other misappropriation of such information. Most states, the EU and other non-U.S. jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes and/or regulations concerning data privacy and security and requiring notification of data breaches. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, establishes new requirements regarding the handling of personal information. Noncompliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was adopted by the State of California and became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA substantially increases the rights of California residents to understand how their personal data is collected and used by commercial businesses and includes a private right of action permitting lawsuits to be brought by private individuals instead of the state Attorney General or other government actor for breaches. These and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of information could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to the protection of such information.

Information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists, organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state actors. If we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective information security relative to the type, size and complexity of our operations, we could become more vulnerable to cyber-attack and, consequently, subject to significant regulatory penalties. Additionally, our computer, communications, data processing, networks, backup, business continuity or other operating, information or technology systems, including those that we outsource to other providers, may fail to operate properly or become disabled, overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities.

The third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks (including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely), and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely, perhaps materially, by failures, terminations, errors or malfeasance by, or attacks or constraints on, one or more financial, technology, infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business. In addition, our clients often use their own devices, such as computers, smart phones and tablets, to manage their accounts, which may heighten the risk of system failures, interruptions or security breaches.

In recent years, several financial services firms suffered successful cyber-attacks launched both domestically and from abroad, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private information, and reputational harm. Although we have not to our knowledge suffered a material breach of our systems, we and our clients have been subject to cyber-attacks, and it is possible that we could suffer a material breach in the future. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, to implement adequate preventative measures, or to address them until they are discovered. In addition, a successful cyber-attack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected. Because any investigation of an information security incident would be inherently unpredictable, the extent of a particular information security incident and the path of investigating the incident may not be immediately clear. It may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, and communication to the public, regulators, clients and other stakeholders may be inaccurate, any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of an information security incident.

We expect to continue to face a wide variety of cyber-threats, including computer viruses, ransomware and other malicious code, distributed denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our, our clients’ or other parties’ confidential, personal, proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt, compromise or damage our or our clients’ or other parties’ business assets, operations and activities. Our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyber-threats. If a breach of our security occurs, we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, the market perception of the


effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients, each of which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our business. An event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services, which could be costly and have a negative impact on our business and reputation.

Further, even if not directed at us, attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of our business.

Errors, breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability, result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways.

In our asset servicing, investment management, fiduciary administration and other business activities, we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money. Failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences, and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses. Given the high volume of transactions we process, errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected.

Our dependence on technology, and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure, exposes us to risks that also can result in losses.

Our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure, both internal and external, to record and process, among other things, a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data, in many currencies, on a daily basis, across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions. Due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations, we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure. Upgrading, replacing, and modernizing these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation, integration and security risks that could cause financial, reputational and operational harm. Failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations. The failure to respond properly to and invest in changes and advancements in technology could limit our ability to attract and retain clients, prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors, inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations.

The systems and models we employ to analyze, monitor and mitigate risks, as well as for other business purposes, are

inherently limited, may not be effective in all cases and, in any case, cannot eliminate all risks that we face.

We use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories, as well as for other business purposes. However, these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate, nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Further, these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of the risks we face. Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations. These assumptions may be incorrect, and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant. Consequently, the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes, each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Errors in the underlying model or model assumptions, or inadequate model assumptions, could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences, including material loss or noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations.


A failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system will be met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. In addition, there are risks that individuals, either employees or contractors, consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by, for example, exceeding trading or investment management limitations, or committing fraud.

Failure of any of our third-party vendors to perform can result in losses.

Third-party vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, and network access. Our use of third-party vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us, including with respect to indemnification and information security, and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers. While we have established risk management processes and continuity plans, any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business. Replacing these third-party vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could create significant delay and expense.

We are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely.

In conducting our U.S. and non-U.S. business, we are subject to risks of loss from various unfavorable political, economic, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations. Less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets, in which we have been expanding our business activities. Our non-U.S. operations accounted for

31%

of our revenue in


. Our non-U.S. businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies. Moreover, the regulatory and supervisory standards and expectations in one jurisdiction may not conform with standards or expectations in other jurisdictions. Even within a particular jurisdiction, the standards and expectations of multiple supervisory agencies exercising authority over our affairs may not be harmonized fully. Accordingly, it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally. The failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could affect our business and results of operations adversely.

We actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint. This optimization may occur by establishing operations in lower-cost locations or by outsourcing to third-party vendors in various jurisdictions. These efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality, control or effective management within these operations. In addition, we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic, political and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions. The increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk. During periods of transition, greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery.

In addition, we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments, money laundering, and laws relating to doing business with certain individuals, groups and countries, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the UK Bribery Act, and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar agencies worldwide. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring, the geographic diversity of our operations, employees, clients and customers, as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal, presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules, regulations, laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely.


Failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively.

Our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results. Through various parts of our business strategy, we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses, including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets. Failure to control these and other costs could affect our earnings negatively and reduce our competitive position. In October 2017, we announced our “Value for Spend” expense management initiative, with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run-rate savings by 2020 through improved organizational alignment, process optimization and strategic sourcing. Although we have made substantial progress toward achieving this goal, we cannot predict its overall effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the future.

Acts of terrorism, natural disasters, global climate change, pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations.

Acts of terrorism, natural disasters, global climate change, pandemics, global conflicts or other similar events could have a negative impact on our business and operations. While we have in place business continuity plans, such events could still damage our facilities, disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business (including communications and technology), result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees, and have a similar impact on our clients, suppliers, third-party vendors and counterparties. These events also could impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital markets activity, lower asset price levels, or disruptions in general economic activity in the United States or abroad, or in financial market settlement functions. In addition, these or similar events may impact economic growth negatively, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations, and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict.

Credit Risks

Failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings.

We evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, including undrawn credit commitments. This process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments. Challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors. Allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet, which in turn would affect earnings negatively.

Market volatility and/or weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings.

Credit risk levels and our earnings also can be affected by market volatility and/or weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit. Adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from market volatility and/or weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans, which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of operations negatively.


The failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss.

The financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions, including banks, broker/dealers, collective investment funds and insurance companies. As a result of these interconnections, we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions. This counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss. Instability in the financial markets has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy. During such periods of instability, we are exposed to increased counterparty risks, both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients. Changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly, are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict. In addition, the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain. Further, the consolidation of financial services firms and the failures of other financial institutions has in the past, and may in the future increase the concentration of our counterparty risk. These risks are heightened by the fact that our operating model relies on the use of unaffiliated sub-custodians to a greater degree than certain of our competitors that have banking operations in more jurisdictions than we do. We are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients’ counterparty credit risk. If a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us, we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in the method pursuant to which the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or other interest rate benchmarks are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations.

Many financial markets currently rely on interbank offered rates (each, an IBOR) as mutually agreed upon reference rates serving as the basis for the pricing and valuation of assets, trading positions, loans and other financial transactions. Following historical concerns about attempted manipulation of IBOR levels, as well as a potential lack of liquidity in the underlying activity that contributes to an IBOR setting, global regulators have signaled interest in replacing existing IBOR rates with alternative reference rates. While there are multiple IBORs, LIBOR is the most widely used interest rate benchmark in the world and serves as the reference rate for our floating-rate funding, certain of the products that we own or offer, various lending and securities transactions in which we are involved, and many derivatives that we use to manage our or our clients’ risk. In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the process for establishing LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021, and as a result, the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021. Any change in the availability or calculation of LIBOR or other interest rate benchmarks may affect adversely the cost or availability of floating-rate funding; the yield on loans or securities held by us; the amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into; the value of loans, securities, or derivative instruments held by us or our clients, which, in the case of assets held by our clients, could also negatively impact the amount of fees we earn in relation to such assets; the trading market for securities based on LIBOR or other benchmarks; the terms of new loans being made using different or modified reference rates; or our ability to use derivative instruments to manage risk effectively. While we are working to facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR to alternative interest rate benchmarks for us and our clients, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the effect that these developments, any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other interest rate benchmarks, or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on LIBOR or other interest rate benchmarks. Further, the potential transition away from the use of LIBOR or other interest rate benchmarks, or uncertainty related to any such potential transition, may cause us to recognize additional costs or experience operational disruptions, which may negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Liquidity Risks

If we do not manage our liquidity effectively, our business could suffer.

Liquidity is essential for the operation of our business. Market conditions, unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. If our access to stable and low-cost sources of funding, such as customer deposits, is reduced, we may need to use alternative funding, which could be more expensive or of limited availability. Further evolution in the regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively. Additional regulations may impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions, including the Corporation and the Bank. Given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes, the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation. For more information on these regulations and other regulatory changes, see “Supervision and Regulation—Liquidity Standards” in Item 1, “Business,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could affect our business adversely.


If the Bank is unable to supply the Corporation with funds over time, the Corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations.

The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries. The Corporation relies on dividends paid to it by the Bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the Corporation. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the Corporation by dividend or otherwise. Dividend payments by the Bank to the Corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the Bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances. For more information on dividend restrictions, see “Supervision and Regulation—Payment of Dividends” in Item 1, “Business,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms.

We may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments, to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients, to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes, including capital rules, or for other purposes. However, our ability to access the capital markets, if needed, will depend on a number of factors, including the state of the financial markets. Rising interest rates, disruptions in financial markets, negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength, or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. Any diminished ability to raise additional capital, if needed, could subject us to liability, restrict our ability to grow, require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan, capital plan and strategic goals adversely.

Any downgrades in our credit ratings, or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength, could affect our borrowing costs, capital costs and liquidity adversely.

Rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control, such as rating-agency-specific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types, which are subject to revision from time to time, and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally.

Downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs, our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity adversely. A failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products. Additionally, our counterparties, as well as our clients, rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us. If we experience diminished financial strength or stability, actual or perceived, a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating, our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions, secured or unsecured, with us, our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers, or our prospective clients may select other service providers, all of which may have other adverse effects on our business.

The risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation, and in some instances failure, of financial institutions, including major global financial institutions, could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors. If our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty, our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients, on our or our clients’ behalf, will be compromised materially. If our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them, our revenues will decrease accordingly.

Our success with large, complex clients requires substantial liquidity.

A significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large, complex clients, which, by their nature, require substantial liquidity. Our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow.


Regulatory and Legal Risks

Failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business, or that reduce earnings.

Virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated, generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions. In the United States, the Corporation, the Bank and many of the Corporation’s other subsidiaries are regulated heavily by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. These regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities. They are directed specifically at protecting depositors, the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole, not our stockholders or other security holders. The Corporation and its subsidiaries also are regulated heavily by bank, securities and other regulators globally and subject to evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection. Regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties, require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business, result in limitations on our ability to conduct business, restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely. Failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely. Similarly, changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively.

Changes by the U.S. and other governments to laws, regulations and policies applicable to the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make regulatory compliance more difficult and costly.

Various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny of financial institutions through many regulatory initiatives. These initiatives have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a compliance violation. While we have programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees. Governments may take further actions to change significantly the way financial institutions are regulated, either through new legislation, new regulations, new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods. We cannot currently predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business. Additionally, governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry, and likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies. Any such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks, lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation, affect our ability to compete successfully, and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways. The full scope and impact of possible legislative or regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory activity is uncertain and difficult to predict.

We may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation, including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities.

Our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us, claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them. Our trust, custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk. This risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit, equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile, or when clients or investors are experiencing losses. In addition, as a publicly-held company, we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws, and volatility in our stock price and those of other financial institutions increases this risk. Claims made or actions brought against us, whether founded or unfounded, may result in injunctions, settlements, damages, fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business. Even if we defend ourselves successfully, the cost of litigation is often substantial, and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties, rating agencies and stockholders, consequently affecting our earnings negatively.

We may be impacted adversely by regulatory enforcement matters.

In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to various regulatory, governmental and enforcement inquiries, investigations and subpoenas. These may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us. In conjunction with enforcement matters, we may face claims for disgorgement, the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of other remedial sanctions, any of which could have an adverse impact on us.


We may fail to set aside adequate reserves for, or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to, pending and threatened claims, with a negative effect on our earnings.

We estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The process is inherently subject to risk, including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case. Our earnings will be adversely affected if our reserves are not adequate.

If we fail to comply with legal standards, we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients, which could affect our earnings negatively.

Managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is an important part of our business. Failure to comply with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws, manage adequately the risks or manage appropriately the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities may subject us to liability or cause client dissatisfaction, which may impact negatively our earnings and growth.

Strategic Risks

If we do not execute strategic plans successfully, we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be impacted negatively.

Our growth depends upon successful, consistent execution of our business strategies. A failure to execute these strategies will impact growth negatively. A failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business. The challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners, delivering enhanced products and services, as well as combining accounting, data processing and internal control systems. To the extent we enter into transactions to acquire complementary businesses and/or technologies, we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions, which could result in increased costs, lowered revenues, ineffective deployment of capital, regulatory concerns, exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation. These risks may be increased if the acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations.

Execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents, which may include approvals of the Federal Reserve Board and other domestic and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities. Further, acquisitions we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals, if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied.

If we are not able to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, our business could be negatively affected.

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees, and continue to compensate our employees competitively. Competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel. Factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs, our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees. Our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs. These regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel, both in businesses and corporate functions, could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our markets, operations and clients, years of industry experience and, in some cases, the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. Similarly, the loss of key employees, either individually or as a group, could affect our clients’ perception of our abilities adversely.

We are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses, which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings.

We provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets. We compete against large, well-capitalized, and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices. In certain businesses, such as foreign exchange trading, electronic networks present a competitive challenge. Additionally, technological advances and the growth of internet-based commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business. Many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures. The same may be said for competitors based in non-U.S. jurisdictions, where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those


applicable to the Corporation and the Bank as U.S.-domiciled financial institutions. These competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow. Pricing pressures, as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price, also may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services, which could have, and in some cases has had, a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.

Damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete, grow and generate revenue.

The failure to meet client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations, operational failures, litigation, regulatory actions or fines, the actual or alleged actions of our affiliates, vendors or other third parties with which we do business, the actual or alleged actions or statements of our employees or adverse publicity could materially and adversely affect our reputation as well as our ability to attract and retain clients or key employees. Damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and accordingly affect our earnings negatively. Damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies, regulators, stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business and the performance of our common stock. Failure to maintain our reputation ultimately would have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively. Further, whereas negative public opinion once was driven primarily by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the proliferation of social media channels utilized by us and third parties, as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, may increase the risk of negative publicity, including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate, misleading or false information, which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences.

We need to invest in innovation constantly, and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively.

Our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation, particularly in light of the current “FinTech” environment, in which financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, and developing potentially industry-changing new products, services and industry standards. Our investment is directed at generating new products and services, and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace. Among other things, investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins. Our investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients, and includes investment in technological innovation as well. Effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important to our success. Falling behind our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities, growth and earnings adversely. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts, including an increased risk that new and emerging technologies may expose us to increased cybersecurity and other information technology threats. We must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services, and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met. Further, our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require start-up costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all.

Failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will affect our businesses and earnings negatively.

The success of our innovation efforts depends, in part, on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives. Not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings, but we must accurately price them (as well as existing products) on a risk-adjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively. Our identification of risks arising from new products and services, both in their design and implementation, and effective responses to those identified risks, including pricing, is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings.


Our success with large, complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal, regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions.

A significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large, complex clients which require an understanding of the market and legal, regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions. Any failure to understand, address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation negatively. We identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls. If we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully, we could incur financial loss, suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably, or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive. In addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. We may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements, our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion. If our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets, legal and regulatory requirements, our businesses, our counterparties, clients or service providers or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations. These risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires end-to-end management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many inter-related products and services.

We may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings.

We may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings, liquidity or valuation issues or other developments, even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments. The risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted.

Other Risks

Changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negatively.

Both U.S. and non-U.S. governments and tax authorities, including states and municipalities, from time to time issue new, or modify existing, tax laws and regulations. These authorities may also issue new, or modify existing, interpretations of those laws and regulations. These new laws, regulations or interpretations, and our actions taken in response to, or reliance upon, such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that affects our earnings negatively.

In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (TCJA) was signed into law. The TCJA introduced a number of changes in then-existing tax law impacting businesses including, among other things, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, disallowance of certain deductions that had previously been allowed, limitations on interest deductions, alteration of the expensing of capital expenditures, adoption of a territorial tax system, assessment of a one-time repatriation tax or “toll-charge” on undistributed earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign corporations, and introduction of certain anti-base erosion provisions. The ultimate impact of the TCJA on our financial condition and results of operations in future years remains uncertain and may differ materially from our expectations due to the anticipated issuance of technical guidance regarding certain elements of the TCJA (including elements impacting the U.S. taxes payable on the income of the Corporation’s non-U.S. branches), changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made with respect to the TCJA, and changes to the competitive landscape in which we operate and other factors.

In the course of our business, we are sometimes subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities, including states and municipalities, regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise affect earnings negatively.

Changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

New accounting standards, changes to existing accounting standards, or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the International Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or bank regulatory agencies, or otherwise reflected in GAAP, potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. These changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities, or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods.


Our ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations, applicable provisions of Delaware law, or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt.

Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends and other distributions of capital as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments under Delaware law. Although we have declared cash dividends on shares of our common stock historically, we are not required to do so. In addition to the approval of our Board of Directors, our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital distributions, is dependent upon, among other things, their payment being made in accordance with a capital plan as to which the Federal Reserve Board has not objected. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve Board will not object to our future capital plans. In addition to imposing restrictions on our ability to return capital to stockholders, an objection by the Federal Reserve Board to a future capital plan would negatively impact our reputation and investor perceptions of us.

A significant source of funds for the Corporation is dividends from the Bank. As a result, our ability to pay dividends on the Corporation’s common stock will depend on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Corporation. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the Corporation by dividend or otherwise. Dividend payments by the Bank to the Corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the Bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Corporation in the future, our ability to pay dividends on the Corporation’s common stock would be affected adversely.

Our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to our preferred stock as to the payment of dividends and/or the distribution of any assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation also generally will be prohibited in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends on our Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series D preferred stock) and Series E Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series E preferred stock). Further, in the future if we default on certain of our outstanding debt or elect to defer interest payments on our Floating Rate Capital Debt we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such payments have been brought current.

Any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend, or even our failure to increase our common stock dividend along with our competitors, likely would have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.

ITEM 1B – UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2 – PROPERTIES

The executive offices of the Corporation and the Bank are located at 50 South La Salle Street in Chicago. This Bank-owned building is occupied by various divisions of Northern Trust’s businesses. Adjacent to this building are two office buildings in which the Bank leases space principally for corporate support functions. Financial services are provided by the Bank and other subsidiaries of the Corporation through a network of offices in

21 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., and across 22 locations in Canada, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region.

The majority of those offices are leased. The Bank’s other primary U.S. operations are located in six facilities: a leased facility at 801 South Canal Street in Chicago; a leased facility at 231 South La Salle Street in Chicago; a leased facility in Tempe, Arizona; and one leased and two Bank-owned supplementary operations/data center buildings located in the western suburbs of Chicago. A majority of the Bank’s London-based staff is located at a leased facility at Canary Wharf in London. Additional support and operations activity originates from four facilities in India, two facilities in Ireland, and one facility in the Philippines, all of which are leased. The Bank and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries operate from various other facilities in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Middle East, most of which are leased. The Bank also has leased space at 333 South Wabash Avenue in Chicago, with employees moving into the space in early 2020.

The Corporation believes that its owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for its business needs. The Corporation continues to evaluate its owned and leased facilities and may determine from time to time that certain of its facilities are no longer necessary for its operations. There is no assurance that the Corporation will be able to dispose of any excess facilities or that it will not incur costs in connection with such dispositions, which could be material to its operating results in a given period.

in


,

primarily resulting from lower foreign exchange swap activity in Treasury.

Other operating income of

$145.5 million

in


increased

14%

from

$127.5 million

in


, primarily due to income related to a bank-owned life insurance program implemented during 2019, higher miscellaneous income, and the prior-year impairment of a community development equity investment previously held at cost, partially offset by a

reflected a decrease in the inherent reserve related to the residential real estate portfolio due to a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality and reductions to the specific reserve related to the commercial and institutional and residential real estate portfolios, partially offset by an increase in the inherent reserve related to the private client portfolio due to an increase in outstanding loans and lower credit quality.

The prior-year credit provision primarily reflected reductions in outstanding loans and undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit and improved credit quality across the portfolio. This was partially offset by increases in specific reserves primarily related to the commercial and institutional portfolio.

Loans and leases of

$31.4 billion

as of

December 31, 2019

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The provision for income taxes in


totaled

$451.9 million

, representing an effective tax rate of

23.2%

. The provision for income taxes in


totaled

$401.4 million

, representing an effective tax rate of

20.5%

.

The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to higher U.S. taxes payable on the income of the Corporation's non-U.S. branches in 2019 as well as income tax benefits recorded in 2018 associated with the timing of tax deductions for software development-related expenses and the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Northern Trust continued to maintain a strong capital position during


, with all capital ratios exceeding those required for classification as “well-capitalized” under federal bank regulatory capital requirements. Total stockholders’ equity

increased

6%

from

$10.5 billion

in


to

$11.1 billion

at year-end. During


, the Corporation issued and sold

16 million

depositary shares, each representing

1/1,000th

ownership interest in a share of Series E Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock for proceeds of

$391.4 million

, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and other issuance costs. These proceeds were subsequently used to fund the redemption of all outstanding shares of the Corporation’s Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock on January 2, 2020.

During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, Northern Trust

increased

its quarterly common stock dividend to

$0.70

Foreign Exchange Trading Income

Northern Trust provides foreign exchange services in the normal course of business as an integral part of its global custody services. Active management of currency positions, within conservative limits, also contributes to foreign exchange trading income. Foreign exchange trading income in


of

$250.9 million

decreased

$56.3 million

, or

18%

, compared with

$307.2 million

in


,

primarily resulting from lower foreign exchange swap activity in Treasury.

$44.5 million

in


decreased

14%

, or

$7.3 million

, from

$51.8 million

in


, primarily due to an increase in the earnings credit rate applied to client balances and lower transaction based volumes.

Security Commissions and Trading Income

Security commissions and trading income is generated primarily from securities brokerage services provided by Northern Trust Securities, Inc., and totaled

$103.6 million

in


, which

increased

5%

, or

$5.3 million

, from

$98.3 million

in


, primarily due to higher revenue from interest rate swaps and core brokerage, partially offset by lower transition management revenue.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is defined as the total of interest income and amortized fees on earning assets, less interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds, adjusted for the impact of interest-related hedging activity. Earning assets – including federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks, Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits and other, securities, and loans and leases – are financed by a large base of interest-bearing funds that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, senior notes and long-term debt. Earning assets also are funded by net noninterest-related funds, which include demand deposits, and stockholders’ equity, reduced by nonearning assets such as noninterest-bearing cash and due from banks, items in process of collection, and buildings and equipment. Net interest income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. In addition, the levels of nonperforming assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact net interest income.

Net interest income stated on an FTE basis is a non-GAAP financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. Management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income. A reconciliation of net interest income on a GAAP basis to net interest income on an FTE basis is provided on page

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses was a credit provision of

$14.5 million

in each of


and


. The current-year credit provision primarily

reflected a decrease in the inherent reserve related to the residential real estate portfolio due to a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality and reductions to the specific reserve related to the commercial and institutional and residential real estate portfolios, partially offset by an increase in the inherent reserve related to the private client portfolio due to an increase in outstanding loans and lower credit quality.

The prior-year credit provision primarily reflected reductions in outstanding loans and undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit and improved credit quality across the portfolio. This was partially offset by increases in specific reserves primarily related to the commercial and institutional portfolio.

Nonperforming assets at

December 31, 2019

decreased

26%

from the prior year-end. Residential real estate, commercial and institutional, commercial real estate, private client, and non-U.S. loans accounted for

Compensation expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, of

$1.86 billion

in


increased

$52.1 million

, or

3%

, compared to

$1.81 billion

in


, primarily reflecting higher salary expense driven by staff growth and base pay adjustments, partially offset by lower incentive expense. Staff on a full-time equivalent basis totaled approximately

19,800

at

Employee Benefits

Employee benefits expense of

$355.2 million

in


decreased

slightly from

$356.7 million

in


, primarily reflecting lower retirement plan and medical expenses, partially offset by higher payroll taxes.

Outside Services

Outside services expense of

$774.5 million

in


increased

$35.1 million

, or

5%

, from

$739.4 million

in


, primarily due to higher technical services costs as well as consulting and legal services, partially offset by lower sub-custodian expenses.

Equipment and Software

Equipment and software expense of

Occupancy

Occupancy expense of

$212.9 million

in


increased

$11.8 million

, or

6%

, from

$201.1 million

Other Operating Expense

Other operating expense of

$329.8 million

in


decreased

slightly from

$330.6 million

in


. The components of other operating expense are as follows:

TABLE 17: OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE

Other operating expense in the current year compared to the prior year

primarily reflects decreased FDIC insurance premiums, partially offset by higher staff-related expense and business promotion expense.

Provision for Income Taxes

Provisions for income tax and effective tax rates are impacted by levels of pre-tax income as well as nonrecurring items such as the resolution of tax matters and changes in income tax rates and tax laws. The


provision for income taxes was

$451.9 million

, representing an effective rate of

23.2%

. This compares with a provision for income taxes of

$401.4 million

and an effective rate of

20.5%

in


.

The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to higher U.S. taxes payable on the income of the Corporation's non-U.S. branches in 2019 as well as income tax benefits recorded in 2018 associated with the timing of tax deductions for software development-related expenses and the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017.

The TCJA was enacted on December 22, 2017, and reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from

35%

to

21%

.

It also required companies to pay a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. At December 31, 2017, Northern Trust made a reasonable estimate as to the impact of the TCJA. During 2018, Northern Trust completed the related calculations and additional analyses associated with the implementation of the TCJA, resulting in a number of adjustments to the 2018 tax provision as follows:

TABLE 18: IMPACT OF TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT

Adjustments in the above table included a tax benefit of

$16.8 million

resulting from an adjustment to the Corporation’s 2017 income tax provision for mandatory deemed repatriation with respect to the pre-2018 earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, offset by a

$12.7 million

net provision recorded associated with the repricing of deferred taxes.

As a result of the TCJA, earnings which had been reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States were deemed to have been repatriated to the United States and were subject to a repatriation tax. As of

December 31, 2018

, Northern Trust’s repatriation tax was

$133.2 million

.

Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on

February 26, 2019

.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Northern Trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: C&IS and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C&IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to C&IS and Wealth Management.

Reporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets, liabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology. Under the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. Equity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, risk, regulatory considerations, and internal metrics. Allocations of capital and certain corporate expense may not be representative of levels that would be required if the segments were independent entities. The accounting policies used for management reporting are consistent with those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Transfers of income and expense items are recorded at cost; there is no consolidated profit or loss on sales or transfers between reporting segments. Northern Trust's presentations are not necessarily consistent with similar information for other financial institutions.

Effective January 1, 2019, Northern Trust implemented several enhancements to its FTP methodology, including the allocation of contingent liquidity charges to C&IS and Wealth Management client instruments and products. These methodology enhancements affect the results of each reporting segment. Due to the lack of historical information, segment results for periods ended prior to January 1, 2019 have not been revised to reflect the methodology enhancements.

Also effective January 1, 2019, all revenues, expenses and average assets are allocated to C&IS and Wealth Management, with the exception of non-recurring activities such as certain costs associated with acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment.

For reporting periods ended prior to January 1, 2019, income and expense associated with the wholesale funding activities and investment portfolios of the Corporation and the Bank, as well as certain corporate-based expense, executive-level compensation and nonrecurring items, were not allocated to C&IS and Wealth Management, and were reported in Treasury and Other.

Reporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made. The results are also subject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies, which are typically reflected on a prospective basis. The following table reflects the earnings and average assets for the Corporation.

Corporate & Institutional Services

C&IS is a leading global provider of asset servicing and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors around the globe. Asset servicing and related services encompass a full range of capabilities including but not limited to: custody; fund administration; investment operations outsourcing; investment management; investment risk and analytical services; employee benefit services; securities lending; foreign exchange; treasury management; brokerage services; transition management services; banking and cash management. Client relationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support from locations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.

C&IS Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees

C&IS trust, investment and other servicing fees are primarily attributable to services related to custody, fund administration, investment management, and securities lending. Custody and fund administration fees are driven primarily by values of client assets under custody/administration, transaction volumes, and number of accounts. The asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. Custody fees related to asset values are client specific and are priced based on month-end market values, quarter-end market values, or the average of month-end market values for the quarter. The fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. Investment management fees, which are based generally on client assets under management, are based primarily on market values throughout a period.

Securities lending revenue is affected by market values; the demand for securities to be lent, which drives volumes; and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed. The other services fee category in C&IS includes such products as investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments, and other services. Revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee.

Other noninterest income for


of

$178.2 million

decreased

$4.8 million

, or

3%

Net interest income on an FTE basis, inclusive of the FTP methodology enhancements described above,

decreased

$73.5 million

, or

7%

, in


to

$918.7 million

from

$992.2 million

in


, primarily reflecting higher charges due to the FTP methodology enhancements and a decrease in the net interest margin, partially offset by an increase in average earning assets. Net interest margin on an FTE basis

decreased

to

1.26%

from

1.29%

. Average earning assets of

$79.1 billion

in


,

increased

from

$54.2 billion

in


.

C&IS Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses was a provision of

$1.9 million

for both


and


. The


provision reflected an increase to the inherent reserve for outstanding loans due to lower credit quality, partially offset by a decrease to the specific reserve related to standby letters of credit and outstanding loans. The


provision reflected increases to the specific reserve  related to standby letters of credit, partially offset by reductions in standby letters of credit and undrawn loan commitments and improved credit quality resulting in a reduction of the inherent allowance.

C&IS Noninterest Expense

Total C&IS noninterest expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support, and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, of

$2.61 billion

in


,

increased

$184.1 million

, or

8%

, from

$2.42 billion

in


. The increase primarily reflects higher expense allocations, including those due to the enhanced segment reporting methodology beginning January 1, 2019, and higher compensation expense, partially offset by lower other operating expenses.

Wealth Management

Wealth Management focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. The business also includes the Global Family Office, which provides customized services to meet the complex financial needs of individuals and family offices in the United States and throughout the world with assets typically exceeding $200 million.

WEALTH MANAGEMENT ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT BY INVESTMENT TYPE

The Wealth Management regions shown above are comprised of the following: Central includes Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin; East includes Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C.; West includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Texas and Washington. Global Family Office provides specialized asset management, investment consulting, global custody, fiduciary, and private banking services to ultra-wealthy domestic and international clients.

Wealth Management fee income is calculated primarily based on market values. Wealth Management trust, investment and other servicing fees of

$1.64 billion

in


increased

$60.0 million

, or

4%

, from

$1.58 billion

in


. The results in


benefited from new business and favorable markets.

At

December 31, 2019

, assets under custody in Wealth Management were

$735.7 billion

compared with

$622.9 billion

at

December 31, 2018

. Assets under management were

$313.8 billion

at

December 31, 2019

compared to

$278.6 billion

at the previous year end.

Wealth Management Foreign Exchange Trading Income

Foreign exchange trading income of

$18.7 million

in


increased

$14.5 million

from

$4.2 million

in


, primarily due to the enhanced segment reporting methodology beginning January 1, 2019.

Wealth Management Other Noninterest Income

Other noninterest income for


of

$131.1 million

,

increased

$28.4 million

, or

28%

, from

$102.7 million

, primarily due to the enhanced segment reporting methodology beginning January 1, 2019.

Wealth Management Net Interest Income

Net interest income on an FTE basis, inclusive of the FTP methodology enhancements described above, of

$792.0 million

for


decreased

$24.5 million

, or

3%

, from

$816.5 million

in


, primarily attributable to a decrease in the net interest margin, partially offset by an increase in earning assets. Net interest margin on an FTE basis

decreased

to

3.06%

from

3.16%

, reflecting lower yields on earning assets. Average earning assets of

$28.0 billion

in


,

increased

$2.1 billion

, or

8%

, in the current year from

$25.9 billion

in


.

Wealth Management Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses was a credit provision of

$16.4 million

in both


and


. The


credit provision was primarily driven by a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio, which resulted in a reduction of the inherent allowance. The


credit provision was primarily driven by improved credit quality and reductions in outstanding loans, standby letters of credit, and undrawn commitments, which resulted in a reduction of the inherent allowance.

Wealth Management Noninterest Expense

Total noninterest expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support, and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, of

$1.53 billion

in


increased

$71.6 million

, or

5%

, from

$1.46 billion

in the prior year. The increase primarily reflects higher expense allocations, including those due to the enhanced segment reporting methodology beginning January 1, 2019, increased compensation expense and outside services expense, partially offset by lower other operating expense.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Treasury and Other

Beginning January 1, 2019, Treasury and Other includes income and expenses associated with non-recurring activities such as certain costs associated with acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments. For reporting periods ended prior to January 1, 2019, income and expense associated with the wholesale funding activities and investment portfolios of the Corporation and the Bank, as well as certain corporate-based expense, executive-level compensation and nonrecurring items, were not allocated to C&IS and Wealth Management, and are reported in Treasury and Other. Treasury and Other information for 2019 is not directly comparable to prior period information due to the enhanced segment reporting methodology beginning January 1, 2019.

See Note 4, “Securities,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for more information on securities.

Northern Trust maintains a high quality debt securities portfolio, with

81%

of the combined available for sale, held to maturity, and trading account portfolios at

December 31, 2019

composed of U.S. Treasury and government-sponsored agency securities and triple-A rated corporate notes, asset-backed securities, covered bonds, sub-sovereign, supranational, sovereign & non-U.S. agency bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions. The remaining portfolio was composed of corporate notes, negotiable certificates of deposit, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and other securities, of which as a percentage of the total securities portfolio,

9%

were rated double-A,

3%

were rated below double-A, and

7%

were not rated by Moody’s Investors Service or Standard and Poor’s. As of

December 31, 2019

, securities not explicitly rated were grouped where possible under the credit rating of the issuer of the security.

At

and

$0.5 million

of losses recognized in


and


, respectively, in connection with the write-down of CRA securities determined to be OTTI.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until the repurchase.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Loans and Leases

During 2017, the Corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes. As a result, the loan and lease balances for periods ended prior to January 1, 2017 below have been adjusted to conform to the presentation for periods ended after such date. The adjustments generally reflected reclassification of loans and leases from the commercial and institutional class to the residential real estate class. There was no impact on total loans and leases previously reported.

The following table presents the amounts outstanding of loans and leases by segment and class as of

December 31, 2019

and the preceding four year-ends.

The following table presents the remaining maturity of selected loans and leases as of

December 31, 2019

.

TABLE 35: REMAINING MATURITY OF SELECTED LOANS AND LEASES

Residential Real Estate

The residential real estate loan portfolio is primarily composed of mortgages and home equity credit lines provided as an accommodation to clients. Residential real estate loans totaled

$6.0 billion

at

December 31, 2019

, or

20%

of total U.S. loans and leases, compared with

$6.5 billion

, or

22%

of total U.S. loans and leases, at

December 31, 2018

. All residential real estate loans are underwritten utilizing Northern Trust’s credit policies, which do not support the origination of loan types generally considered to be of high risk in nature, such as option adjustable rate mortgage loans, subprime loans, loans with initial “teaser” rates, and loans with excessively high loan-to-value ratios. Residential real estate loans consist of traditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines that generally require a loan-to-collateral value of no more than

65%

to

80%

at inception. Appraisals of supporting collateral for residential real estate loans are obtained at loan origination and upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted. Residential real estate collateral appraisals are performed and reviewed by independent third parties.

Of the total

$6.0 billion

in residential real estate loans at

December 31, 2019

,

$1.6 billion

were in Florida,

$1.2 billion

were in California, and

$1.0 billion

were in the greater Chicago area, with the remainder distributed throughout the other geographic regions within the United States served by Northern Trust. Legally binding undrawn commitments to extend residential real estate credit, which are primarily equity credit lines, totaled

$714.2 million

and

$824.0 million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

Commercial Real Estate

In managing its credit exposure, management has defined a commercial real estate loan as one where: (1) the borrower’s principal business activity is the acquisition or the development of real estate for commercial purposes; (2) the principal collateral is real estate held for commercial purposes, and loan repayment is expected to flow from the operation of the property; or (3) the loan repayment is expected to flow from the sale or refinance of real estate as a normal and ongoing part of the business. Unsecured lines of credit to firms or individuals engaged in commercial real estate endeavors are included without regard to the use of loan proceeds. The commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended primarily to experienced investors well known to Northern Trust. Underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage requirements. Recourse to owners through guarantees also is commonly required.

Commercial mortgage financing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of income-producing properties. Cash flows from the properties generally are sufficient to amortize the loan. These loans are primarily located in the

California

,

Illinois

,

Florida

,

Texas

, and

Arizona

markets. Construction, acquisition and development loans provide financing for commercial real estate prior to rental income stabilization. The intent is generally that the borrower will sell the project or refinance the loan through a commercial mortgage with Northern Trust or another financial institution upon completion.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table provides additional detail regarding commercial real estate loan types:

TABLE 36: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS

At

December 31, 2019

, legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to commercial real estate borrowers totaled

$301.6 million

and

$9.2 million

, respectively. At

December 31, 2018

, legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to commercial real estate borrowers totaled

$331.4 million

and

$8.5 million

, respectively.

Nonperforming Assets and 90 Days Past Due Loans

During 2017, the Corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes. As a result, the loan and lease balances for periods ended prior to January 1, 2017 below have been adjusted to conform to the presentation for periods ended after such date. The adjustments generally reflected reclassification of loans and leases from the commercial and institutional class to the residential real estate class. There was no impact on total loans and leases previously reported.

Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and leases and other real estate owned (OREO). OREO is comprised of commercial and residential properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans. Loans that are delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest can fluctuate widely at any reporting period based on the timing of cash collections, renegotiations and renewals. The following table presents nonperforming assets and loans that were delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing at

December 31, 2019

and each of the prior four year-ends.

TABLE 37: NONPERFORMING ASSETS


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Nonperforming assets of

$86.8 million

as of

December 31, 2019

decreased

$30.9 million

, or

26%

from

$117.7 million

at

December 31, 2018

, reflecting decreases in the residential real estate portfolio driven by payoffs and payments, partially offset by new nonperforming assets. Changes in the level of nonperforming assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes. Changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the specific allowance and the quantitative and qualitative factors used in the determination of the inherent allowance levels within the allowance for credit losses.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses

During 2017, the Corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes. The allowance for credit losses as of and prior to December 31, 2016 remains unadjusted, as the impact of the reclassification on the allowance was immaterial.

TABLE 38: ANALYSIS OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The provision for credit losses is the charge to current period earnings that is determined by management, through a disciplined credit review process, to be the amount needed to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb probable credit losses that have been identified with specific borrower relationships (specific loss component) and for probable losses that are believed to be inherent in the loan and lease portfolios, undrawn commitments, and standby letters of credit (inherent loss component).

The SEC requires the disclosure of the allowance for credit losses that is applicable to international operations. The disclosure has been prepared in compliance with this disclosure requirement and is used in determining non-U.S. operating performance. The amounts disclosed should not be construed as being the only amounts that are available for non-U.S. loan charge-offs, since the entire allowance for credit losses assigned to loans and leases is available to absorb losses on both U.S. and non-U.S. loans. In addition, these amounts are not intended to be indicative of future charge-off trends. There was no allowance for credit losses relating to non-U.S. operations for years 2016 through 2019. For 2015, there was a

$3.3 million

allowance for credit losses at the beginning of the year, a credit provision of

$3.3 million

during the year, and no allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2015.

The following table shows the specific portion of the allowance and the allocated inherent portion of the allowance and its components by loan category at

December 31, 2019

, and at each of the prior four year-ends.

TABLE 39: ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Specific Component of the Allowance:

The amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired taking into consideration expected future cash flows, collateral value, and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay.

The specific allowance component

decreased

$3.1 million

from

$10.0 million

at

December 31, 2018

to

$6.9 million

at

December 31, 2019

, primarily attributable to standby letters of credit and outstanding loans in the commercial and institutional portfolio and outstanding loans in the residential real estate portfolios.

Inherent Component of the Allowance:

The inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified credit-related losses. The inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit. To estimate the allowance for credit losses on these instruments, management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans.

The inherent portion of the allowance

decreased

$10.7 million

to

$117.5 million

at

December 31, 2019

, compared with

$128.2 million

at

December 31, 2018

, primarily due to a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality within the residential real estate portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the inherent reserve related to the private client portfolio due to an increase in outstanding loans and lower credit quality.

Overall Allowance:

The evaluation of the specific component and the inherent component above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of

$124.4 million

at

December 31, 2019

, compared with

$138.2 million

at the end of


. The allowance of

$104.5 million

assigned to loans and leases, as a percentage of total loans and leases, was

0.33%

at

December 31, 2019

, which

decreased

from a

$112.6 million

allowance assigned to loans and leases, representing

0.35%

of total loans and leases at

December 31, 2018

. Allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled

$19.9 million

and

$25.6 million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, and are included in Other Liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Provision:

The provision for credit losses was a credit provision of

$14.5 million

and net recoveries totaled

$0.7 million

in


. This compares with a credit provision of

$14.5 million

and net charge-offs of

$1.1 million

in


.

Impaired Loans

A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtor’s financial difficulties, referred to as a troubled debt restructuring. As of

December 31, 2019

, impaired loans totaled

$92.2 million

and included

$82.6 million

of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of

$116.2 million

at

December 31, 2018

, which included

$99.8 million

of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings. Impaired loans had

$5.0 million

and

$7.2 million

of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at

December 31, 2019

, and


, respectively. Impaired loans are measured based upon the loan’s market price, the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan, dependent upon the level of certainty of loss, either a specific allowance is established or a charge-off is recorded for the difference. Smaller balance (individually less than $1 million as of

December 31, 2019

) homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures in


included continued investments to enhance Northern Trust’s software and hardware capabilities, the opening of new offices, and the expansion and renovation of several existing offices. Capital expenditures for


totaled

$599.8 million

, of which

$441.8 million

was for software,

$73.7 million

was for computer hardware,

$77.7 million

was for building and leasehold improvements, and

$6.6 million

was for furnishings. These capital expenditures principally support, enhance, and protect Northern Trust’s investment management, asset servicing and asset management systems and capabilities, and deliver innovative solutions to better serve our clients. Additional capital expenditures committed for technology systems will result in future expense for the depreciation of hardware and amortization of software. Software amortization and depreciation on computer hardware and machinery are charged to equipment and software expense. Depreciation on building and leasehold improvements and on furnishings is charged to occupancy expense and equipment expense, respectively. Capital expenditures for


totaled

$506.0 million

, of which

$408.4 million

was for software,

$62.0 million

Geographic Area Information

Northern Trust’s non-U.S. activities are primarily related to its asset servicing, asset management, foreign exchange, cash management, and commercial banking businesses. The operations of Northern Trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both U.S and non-U.S. source assets. Non-U.S. source assets are not separately identified in Northern Trust’s internal management reporting system. However, Northern Trust is required to disclose non-U.S. activities based on the domicile of the customer. Due to the complex and integrated nature of Northern Trust’s activities, it is difficult to segregate with precision assets between U.S. and non-U.S.-domiciled customers. Therefore, certain subjective estimates and assumptions have been made to allocate assets between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.

The following tables present selected average assets and liabilities attributable to non-U.S. operations (based on the obligor's domicile) and the percent of those balances to total consolidated average assets. See also Note 33, “Reporting Segments and Related Information,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

TABLE 46: PERCENT OF NON-U.S.-RELATED AVERAGE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO TOTAL CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE ASSETS

NON-U.S. OUTSTANDINGS

As used in this discussion and the following table, non-U.S. outstandings are cross-border outstandings as defined by the SEC. They consist of loans, securities, interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions, accrued interest and other monetary assets. Not included are letters of credit, loan commitments, and non-U.S. office local currency claims on residents. Non-U.S. outstandings related to a country are net of guarantees given by third parties resident outside the country and the value of tangible, liquid collateral realizable outside the country. However, transactions with branches of non-U.S. banks are included in these outstandings and are classified according to the country location of the non-U.S. bank’s head office.

Short-term interbank time deposits with non-U.S. banks represent the largest category of non-U.S. outstandings. Northern Trust actively participates in the interbank market with U.S. and non-U.S. banks.

Northern Trust places deposits with non-U.S. counterparties that have strong internal (Northern Trust) risk ratings and external credit ratings. These non-U.S. banks are approved and monitored by Northern Trust’s Capital Markets Credit Committee, which has credit authority for exposure to all non-U.S. banks and approves credit limits. This process includes financial analysis of the non-U.S. banks, use of an internal risk rating system and consideration of external market indicators. Each counterparty is reviewed at least annually and potentially more frequently based on credit fundamentals or general market conditions. Separate from the entity-specific review process, the average life to maturity of deposits with non-U.S. banks is deliberately maintained on a short-term basis in order to respond quickly to changing credit conditions. Northern Trust also utilizes certain risk mitigation tools and agreements that may reduce exposures through use of collateral and/or balance sheet netting. Additionally, the Capital Market Credit Committee oversees country-risk analyses and imposes limits to country exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity

As the Corporation’s principal subsidiary encompassing all of Northern Trust’s banking activities, the Bank centrally manages liquidity for all U.S. and international banking operations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, including client deposits (institutional and personal) from the C&IS and Wealth Management businesses, wholesale funding from the capital markets, maturities of short-term investments, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure additional funds. While management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity, at

December 31, 2019

, the Bank had over

$38.0 billion

of securities and loans readily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings. The Bank also is active in the U.S. interbank funding market, providing an important source of additional liquidity and low-cost funds. Liquidity supports a variety of activities, including client withdrawals, purchases of securities, net loan growth, and draws on commitments to extend credit. Northern Trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet, with cash and due from banks, deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, short-term money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing

69%

of total assets as of

December 31, 2019

. The market value of unencumbered securities at the Bank, which include those placed at the Federal Reserve discount window, totaled

$46.7 billion

at

December 31, 2019

. The Corporation and the Bank each satisfied the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio requirements during


.

The liquidity of the Corporation is managed separately from that of the Bank. The primary sources of cash for the Corporation are issuances of debt or equity, dividend payments from the Bank, and interest earned on investment securities and money market assets. On

May 3, 2019

, the Corporation issued

$500 million

of

3.15%

senior notes, due

May 3, 2029

. The Corporation also received

$2.0 billion

of dividends from the Bank in


. Dividends from the Bank are subject to certain restrictions, as discussed in further detail in Note 32, “Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends and Loans or Advances,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

The Corporation’s uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the Corporation’s stockholders; the payment of principal and interest to note holders; repurchases of its common stock; and investments in, or loans to, its subsidiaries. The most significant uses of cash by the Corporation during


were

$1.1 billion

of common stock repurchases and

$529.7 million

of common stock dividends.

The Corporation’s liquidity, defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets, was

$2.6 billion

and

$866.8 million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. During, and at year-end,


and


, these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the Bank or overnight money market placements, both of which were fully available to the Corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries, as needed. Average liquidity during


and


was

$1.96 billion

and

$887.0 million

, respectively. The cash flows of the Corporation are shown in Note 35, “Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation only),” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

A significant source of liquidity for both the Corporation and the Bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally. The credit ratings of the Corporation and the Bank as of

December 31, 2019

, provided below, allow Northern Trust to access capital markets on favorable terms.

TABLE 48: NORTHERN TRUST CREDIT RATINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31,


A significant downgrade in one or more of these ratings could limit Northern Trust’s access to capital markets and/or increase the rates paid for short-term borrowings, including deposits, and future long-term debt issuances. The size of these rate increases would depend on multiple factors, including the extent of the downgrade, Northern Trust’s relative debt rating compared to other financial institutions, current market conditions, and other factors. In addition, as discussed in Note 28, “Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Northern Trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain credit-risk-related contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare Northern Trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event Northern Trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels. At

December 31, 2019

, the net maximum amount of these termination payments that Northern Trust could have been required to pay was

$439.1 million

. Other than these credit-risk-related contingent derivative counterparty payments, Northern Trust had no long-term debt covenants or other credit-risk-related payments at

December 31, 2019

, that would be triggered by a significant downgrade in its debt ratings.

Statements of Cash Flows

For the year ended

December 31, 2019

, net cash provided by operating activities was

$2.6 billion

, primarily reflecting period earnings and lower net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended

December 31, 2018

, was

$1.8 billion

, primarily reflecting period earnings and the impact of other operating activities and non-cash charges such as amortization of computer software, partially offset by higher net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties.

Net cash used in investing activities was

$3.4 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, primarily reflecting higher levels of deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, net purchases of debt securities available for sale, and the purchase of bank-owned life insurance policies in


, partially offset by the net proceeds from the maturity and redemption of debt securities held to maturity and lower levels of loans and leases.

Net cash provided by investing activities was

$4.3 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2018

, primarily reflecting decreased levels of deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks and lower interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by net purchases of debt securities available for sale and held to maturity and the net change in other investing activities.

For the year ended

December 31, 2019

, net cash provided by financing activities totaled

$0.6 billion

, primarily reflecting higher levels of total deposits, proceeds from the issuance by the Corporation of 3.15% senior notes, and proceeds from the Series E Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock issuance, partially offset by lower federal funds purchased, lower short-term other borrowings, and the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation’s share repurchase program. The increase in total deposits was primarily attributable to higher levels of domestic interest-bearing client deposits and non-U.S. office noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower levels of non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits.

For the year ended

December 31, 2018

, net cash used in financing activities totaled

$5.8 billion

, primarily reflecting

decreased levels of total deposits, the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation’s share repurchase program,


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

lower securities sold under agreements to repurchase, dividends paid on common and preferred stock, and repayments of the 6.50% subordinated notes previously issued by the Bank and due August 2018, partially offset by higher short-term other borrowings and the proceeds from the issuance by the Corporation of 3.65% senior notes. The decrease in total deposits was primarily attributable to lower levels of non-interest bearing domestic and non-U.S. office client deposits and lower domestic interest-bearing client deposits.

Regulatory Environment

Northern Trust actively follows regulatory developments and regularly evaluates its liquidity risk management framework against proposed rulemaking and industry best practices in order to comply with applicable regulations and further enhance its liquidity policies. Please refer to “Liquidity Standards” under “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1, “Business,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of applicable liquidity standards.

“Lease Commitments,”

to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for further details.

(3) Purchase obligations consist of enforceable and legally binding agreements to purchase products or services at specified significant terms.

Capital Management

One of Northern Trust’s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to merit the confidence of clients, counterparties, creditors, regulators and stockholders. A strong capital position helps Northern Trust execute its strategies and withstand unforeseen adverse developments.

Senior management, with oversight from the Capital Governance Committee and the full Board of Directors, is responsible for capital management and planning. Northern Trust manages its capital on both a total Corporation basis and a legal entity basis. The Capital Committee is responsible for measuring and managing capital metrics against levels set forth within the Capital Policy approved by the Capital Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. In establishing the metrics related to capital, a variety of factors are taken into consideration, including the unique risk profiles of Northern Trust’s businesses, regulatory requirements, capital levels relative to peers, and the impact on credit ratings.

Capital levels were strengthened in

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In accordance with Basel III requirements, capital ratios are calculated using both the standardized and advanced approaches. For each ratio, the lower of the result calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach serves as the effective ratio for purposes of determining capital adequacy. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Corporation’s common stockholders’ equity to total risk-based capital and its risk-based capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. regulatory rules as of

December 31, 2019

and

TABLE 50: CAPITAL ADEQUACY

(1) Risk-weighted assets exclude, as applicable under each regulatory approach, amounts primarily related to goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and net unrealized gains or losses on securities and reflect adjustments for excess allowances for credit losses that have been excluded from Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, if any.

(2) Adjusted average fourth quarter assets exclude amounts primarily related to goodwill, other intangible assets, and net unrealized gains or losses on securities.

(3) Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation and Bank are subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent.

As of

December 31, 2019

As of

December 31, 2019

, the Corporation’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the advanced approaches methodologies would have been

13.2%

on a fully phased-in basis, while the Corporation’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the standardized approach would have been

12.7%

on a fully phased-in basis.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Assets Under Custody/Administration and Assets Under Management

Northern Trust, in the normal course of business, holds assets under custody/administration and management in a fiduciary or agency capacity for its clients. In accordance with GAAP, these assets are not assets of Northern Trust and are not included in its consolidated balance sheets.

Commitments, Letters of Credit, and Securities Lent with Indemnification

Northern Trust, in the normal course of business, enters into various types of commitments and issues letters of credit to meet the liquidity and credit enhancement needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these instruments represent the potential credit exposure should the instrument be drawn fully upon and the client default. To control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit, Northern Trust subjects such activities to the same credit quality and monitoring controls as its lending activities. The following table provides details of Northern Trust’s off-balance-sheet financial instruments as of

December 31, 2019

and


.

TABLE 51: SUMMARY OF OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CONTRACT AMOUNTS


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Undrawn commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since a significant portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements. The following table provides information about the industry sector and expiration dates of undrawn commitments to extend credit as of

December 31, 2019

.

TABLE 52: UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT BY INDUSTRY SECTOR

(1) Commercial and Institutional industry sector information is presented on the basis of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

Standby letters of credit obligate Northern Trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the clients are unable to do so. These instruments are primarily issued to support public and private financial commitments, including commercial paper, bond financing, initial margin requirements on futures exchanges and similar transactions. Northern Trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements and in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants. Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees of

$2.4 billion

and

$2.5 billion

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, include

$44.5 million

and

$72.3 million

, respectively, of standby letters of credit secured by cash deposits or participated to others.

Financial guarantees are issued by Northern Trust to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party under certain arrangements.

Commercial letters of credit are instruments issued by Northern Trust on behalf of its clients that authorize a third party (the beneficiary) to draw drafts up to a stipulated amount under the specified terms and conditions of the agreement and other similar instruments. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily to facilitate international trade.

As part of its securities custody activities and at the direction of its clients, Northern Trust lends securities owned by clients to borrowers who are reviewed and approved by the Northern Trust Capital Markets Credit Committee. In connection with these activities, Northern Trust has issued indemnifications to certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrower’s failure to return securities when due, should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

required to be posted. Borrowers are required to collateralize fully securities received with cash or marketable securities. As securities are loaned, collateral is maintained at a minimum of

100%

of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest. The collateral is revalued on a daily basis. The amount of securities loaned subject to indemnification was

$138.1 billion

and

$128.9 billion

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. Because of the credit quality of the borrowers and the requirement to fully collateralize securities borrowed, management believes that the exposure to credit loss from this activity is not significant and no liability was recorded at

December 31, 2019

, or


related to these indemnifications.

Additional information about Northern Trust’s off-balance-sheet financial instruments is included in

Note 29, “Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments, Guarantees and Other Commitments”

to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Variable Interest Entities

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) are defined within GAAP as entities which either have a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Investors that finance a VIE through debt or equity interests, or other counterparties that provide other forms of support, such as guarantees, subordinated fee arrangements, or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder, if any, that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the VIE’s primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.

Leveraged Leases.

In leveraged leasing transactions, Northern Trust acts as lessor of the underlying asset subject to the lease and typically funds


-

30%

of the asset’s cost via an equity ownership in a trust with the remaining


-

80%

provided by third-party non-recourse debt holders. In such transactions, the trusts, which are VIEs, are created to provide the lessee use of the property with substantially all of the rights and obligations of ownership. The lessee’s maintenance and operation of the leased property has a direct effect on the fair value of the underlying property, and the lessee also has the ability to increase the benefits it can receive and limit the losses it can suffer by the manner in which it uses the property. As a result, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the leveraged lease trust VIEs given it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the leveraged lease trust VIEs.

Tax Credit Structures.

Northern Trust invests in qualified affordable housing projects and community development entities (collectively, community development projects) that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits. The community development projects are formed as limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which Northern Trust invests as a limited partner/investor member through equity contributions. The economic performance of the community development projects, some of which are VIEs, is subject to the performance of their underlying investment and their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development project VIEs as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. This power is held by the general partners and managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the community development project VIEs.

Investment Funds.

Northern Trust acts as asset manager for various funds in which clients of Northern Trust are investors. As an asset manager of funds, Northern Trust earns a competitively priced fee that is based on assets managed and varies with each fund’s investment objective. Based on its analysis, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs under GAAP.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and actual results could differ from those estimates. The SEC has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on Northern Trust’s future financial condition and results of operations.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For Northern Trust, accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and pension plan accounting. Management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee).

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses which have been incurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. The loan and lease portfolio and other lending-related credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses. In determining an appropriate allowance level, Northern Trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lending-related commitments and estimates losses inherent in other lending-related credit exposures.

The allowance for credit losses consists of the following components:

Specific Allowance:

The specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired taking into consideration expected future cash flows, collateral value, and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay. For impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance, if any, is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management. These appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral.

Inherent Allowance:

The inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss data specific to the Northern Trust loan and lease portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both expansionary and recessionary periods. The estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into segments based on loan type, loan size, and borrower rating. For each segment, the probability of default over a loss emergence period and a loss given default are derived from the historical data and applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance. The estimated allowance is reviewed by the Loan Loss Reserve Committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio. In determining the appropriate adjustment, management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology. The Loan Loss Reserve Committee is comprised of representatives from Credit Risk Management, the reporting segments and Corporate Finance.

The quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by Credit Risk Management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of, and adjustment for, changes in estimated credit loss levels. In addition to Northern Trust’s own experience, management also considers regulatory guidance. Control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate.

Loans, leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are charged-off or a specific reserve is established based on management’s assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss. The provision for credit losses, which is charged to income, is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process. Actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net charge-offs.

Management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. Management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, in determining an appropriate allowance level. Due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates, other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in


and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.

Additionally, as an integral part of their examination process, various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses. These agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. However, management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Pension Plan Accounting

Northern Trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees (U.S. Qualified Plan) and a U.S. noncontributory supplemental pension plan (U.S. Non-qualified Plan). Certain European-based employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans, of which the majority are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals. Measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates, asset returns, compensation increases, mortality rates, and other actuarially-based projections relating to the plans. Due to the long-term nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made, the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required. Pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. The differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants. As a result, differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders’ equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods.

Northern Trust recognizes the significant impact that these pension-related assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year. These procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans’ actuaries. In addition to actual experience, adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities, known compensation trends and policies, as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets.

In determining the pension expense for the U.S. pension plans in


, Northern Trust utilized a discount rate of

4.47%

for both the U.S. Qualified Plan and the U.S. Non-qualified Plan. The rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from

9.00%

to

2.50%

that averaged

4.39%

. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. Qualified Plan assets was

6.00%

.

In evaluating possible revisions to pension-related assumptions for the U.S. pension plans as of Northern Trust’s

December 31, 2019

measurement date, the following were considered:

•

Discount Rate:

Northern Trust estimates the discount rate for its U.S. pension plans by applying the projected cash flows for future benefit payments to the Aon AA Above Median yield curve as of the measurement date. This yield curve is composed of individual zero-coupon interest rates for 198 different time periods over a 99-year time horizon. Zero-coupon rates utilized by the yield curve are mathematically derived from observable market yields for AA-rated corporate bonds. This yield curve model referenced by Northern Trust in establishing the discount rate resulted in a rate of

3.37%

at

December 31, 2019

for the U.S. Qualified and Non-qualified plans, a decrease from

4.47%

at

December 31, 2018

.

•

Compensation Level:

Based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience, the compensation scale assumption is based on a graded schedule from

9.00%

to

2.50%

that averages

4.97%

.

•

Rate of Return on Plan Assets:

The expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the long-term (30 years) rate of return on plan assets, which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience, giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness. As a result of these analyses, Northern Trust’s rate of return assumption for the U.S. Qualified Plan decreased from

6.00%

for 2019 to

5.25%

for 2020.

•

Mortality Table:

As of

December 31, 2019

, Northern Trust has adopted the aggregate Pri-2012 mortality table with a 2012 base year, which was released by the Society of Actuaries in October 2019. Northern Trust’s pension obligations reflect proposed future improvement under scale MP-2019, which was also released by the Society of Actuaries in October 2019. This assumption was updated at

December 31, 2019

from improvement scale MP-2018. The updated improvement scale applies to annuity payments only and results in generally lower projected mortality improvements than estimated by the MP-2018 improvement scale. Mortality assumptions on lump sum payments remain static and continue to be in line with the IRS prescribed table for minimum lump sums in 2020.

Net pension expense in 2020 is expected to increase by approximately

$30.6 million

,

primarily driven by the decrease in discount rate and expected rate of return.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected U.S pension plans’ periodic pension expense in


and the projected benefit obligation as of

December 31, 2019

, the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points.

TABLE 53: SENSITIVITY OF U.S. PENSION PLANS ASSUMPTIONS

Pension Contributions:

The deduction limits specified by the Internal Revenue Code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a “Target Liability” under the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. There were

no

contributions to the U.S. Qualified Plan for the


plan year. Northern Trust contributed

$50.0 million

to the U.S. Qualified Plan at the beginning of 2018, retrospectively for the 2017 plan year. The minimum required contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan is expected to be

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value. As of

December 31, 2019

, approximately

29%

of Northern Trust’s total assets and approximately

1%

of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As discussed more fully in Note 3, “Fair Value Measurements,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” GAAP requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted, active market prices for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place (Level 3). Approximately

11%

of Northern Trust’s assets carried at fair value are classified as Level 1. Northern Trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange.

Approximately

89%

of Northern Trust’s assets and

99%

of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as Level 2, as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. Investment debt securities classified as available for sale make up

97%

of Level 2 assets with the remaining

3%

primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments. Level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments.

Northern Trust’s Level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities, the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors. Northern Trust has a well-established process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in Note 3, “Fair Value Measurements,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

As of

December 31, 2019

, all derivative assets and liabilities, excluding the swap related to the sale of certain Visa Class B common shares described below, were classified as Level 2 and approximately

97%

, measured on a notional value basis, related to client-related and trading activities, predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts. Derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted income-based models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts. Northern Trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments. Factors considered included the likelihood of default by Northern Trust and its counterparties, the remaining maturities of the instruments, net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements, available collateral, and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments. The resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material.

As of

December 31, 2019

, Northern Trust’s Level 3 liabilities consisted of swaps that Northern Trust entered into with the purchaser of

1.1 million

and

1.0 million

shares of Visa Inc. Class B common stock (Visa Class B common shares) previously held by Northern Trust and sold in June 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pursuant to the swaps, Northern Trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into shares of Visa Inc. Class A common stock (Visa Class A common shares), such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ratio and Northern Trust will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. The swaps also require periodic payments from Northern Trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of Visa Class A common shares and a fixed rate of interest. The fair value of the swaps are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are Northern Trust’s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares, the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the Visa Class A common share price. See “Visa Class B Common Shares” under Note 26, “Contingent Liabilities,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

While Northern Trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to Level 3 assets, could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS

On January 1, 2020, Northern Trust adopted ASU No. 2016-13

, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 significantly changes the way impairment of financial instruments is recognized by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of financial instruments. The main provisions of ASU 2016-13 include (1) replacing the “incurred loss” approach under current GAAP with an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost, (2) requiring entities to record an allowance for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount of the investments, as is required by the other-than-temporary-impairment model under current GAAP, and (3) a simplified accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.

In conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2016-13,

Northern Trust expects an increase in the allowance for credit losses of less than $20 million. This change in accounting principle will be applied prospectively by increasing the allowance for credit losses on January 1, 2020, with a corresponding cumulative effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings, net of income taxes. Periods prior to the adoption date will not be adjusted. Northern Trust also expects that the Corporation and the Bank's capital ratios will not be materially impacted by the adoption of this standard.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal - Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)” (ASU 2018-15).

ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license).

ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, although early adoption is permitted.

ASU 2018-15 is not expected to have a significant impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk Management Overview

Northern Trust employs an integrated risk management framework to support its business decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies. The framework provides a methodology to identify, assess, monitor, measure, manage and report both internal and external risks to Northern Trust, and promotes a culture of risk awareness and good conduct across the organization. Northern Trust’s risk culture encompasses the general awareness, attitude and conduct of employees with respect to risk and the management of risk across all lines of defense within the organization. Northern Trust cultivates a culture of effective risk management by defining and embedding risk management accountabilities in all employee performance expectations and provides training, development and performance rewards to reinforce this culture.

Northern Trust’s risk management framework contains three inter-related elements, designed to support consistent enterprise risk identification, management and reporting: a comprehensive risk inventory, a static taxonomy of risk categories and a dynamic taxonomy of risk themes. The risk inventory is a detailed register of the risks inherently faced by Northern Trust. The risk categories and risk themes are classification systems used for classifying and managing the risk inventory and enabling different risk profile views. All identified risks inherent in Northern Trust’s business activities are cataloged into the following risk categories: credit, operational, fiduciary, compliance, market, liquidity, and strategic risk. All material risks are also dynamically cataloged into various risk themes which are defined groupings that share common characteristics, focus on business outcomes and span across risk categories.

Northern Trust implements its risk management framework through a “three lines of defense” operating model, embedding a robust risk management capability within its businesses. The model, used to communicate risk management expectations


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

across the organization, contains three roles, each a complementary level of risk management accountability. Within this operating model, Northern Trust’s businesses are the first line of defense for protecting it against the risks inherent in its businesses and are supported by dedicated business risk management teams. The Risk Management function, the second line of defense, sets the direction for Northern Trust’s risk management activities and provides aggregate risk oversight and reporting in support of risk governance. Audit Services, the third line of defense, provides independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the integrated risk framework.

Risk Governance and Oversight Overview

Risk governance is an integral aspect of corporate governance at Northern Trust, and includes clearly defined accountabilities, expectations, internal controls and processes for risk-based decision-making and escalation of issues. The diagram below provides a high-level overview of Northern Trust’s risk governance structure, highlighting oversight by the Board of Directors and key risk-related committees.

TABLE 54: RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

The Board of Directors provides oversight of risk management directly and through certain of its committees: the Audit Committee, the Business Risk Committee, the Capital Governance Committee and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. The Board of Directors approves Northern Trust’s risk management framework and Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. The Business Risk Committee assumes primary responsibility and oversight with respect to credit risk, operational risk, fiduciary risk, compliance risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and strategic risk. The Audit Committee provides oversight with respect to financial reporting and legal risk, while the Compensation and Benefits Committee oversees the development and operation of Northern Trust’s incentive compensation program. The Compensation and Benefits Committee annually reviews management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the design and performance of Northern Trust’s incentive compensation arrangements and practices in providing incentives that are consistent with Northern Trust’s safety, soundness, and culture. This assessment includes an evaluation of whether Northern Trust’s incentive compensation arrangements and practices discourage inappropriate risk-taking behavior by participants. The Capital Governance Committee assists the Board in discharging its oversight duties with respect to capital management and resolution planning activities. Among other responsibilities, the Capital Governance Committee oversees Northern Trust’s capital adequacy assessments, forecasting, and stress testing processes and activities, including the annual CCAR exercise, and challenges management, as appropriate, on various elements of such processes and activities. Accordingly, the Capital Governance Committee provides oversight with respect to Northern Trust’s linkage of material risks to the capital adequacy assessment process.

The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) oversees Northern Trust’s management of risk and compliance, promotes risk awareness and fosters a proactive risk management environment wherein risks inherent in the business strategy are identified, understood, appropriately monitored and mitigated. The CRO reports directly to the Business Risk Committee and the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer. The CRO regularly advises the Business Risk Committee and reports to the Committee at least quarterly on risk exposures, risk management deficiencies and emerging risks. In accordance with the risk management framework, the CRO and the Risk Management executive leadership team of Northern Trust, together with the Chief Financial Officer, Head of Capital and Resolution Planning, General Counsel and Chief Audit Executive, meet as the Global Enterprise Risk Committee (GERC) to provide executive management oversight and guidance with respect to the management of the categories of risk and risk themes within Northern Trust. Among other risk management responsibilities, GERC receives reports, escalations, or recommendations from senior risk committees that are responsible for the management of risk, and from time to time may delegate responsibility to such committees for risk issues. Senior risk committees include:

The Credit Risk Committee (CRC)

establishes and monitors credit-related policies and practices throughout Northern Trust and promotes their uniform application.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Operational Risk Committee (ORC)

provides independent oversight and is responsible for setting the operational risk-related policies and developing the operational risk management framework and programs that support coordination of operational risk activities.

The Fiduciary Risk Committee (FRC)

is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities.

The Compliance & Ethics Oversight Committee (CEOC)

provides oversight and direction with respect to compliance policies, implementation of the compliance and ethics program, and the coordination of regulatory compliance initiatives across the Corporation.

The Market & Liquidity Risk Committee (MLRC)

oversees activities relating to the management of market and liquidity risks by facilitating a focused review of market and liquidity risk exposures and providing rigorous challenge of related policies, key assumptions, and practices.

The Model Risk Oversight Committee (MROC)

is responsible for providing management attention, direction, and oversight of the model risk management framework and model risk within Northern Trust.

In addition to the aforementioned committees, Northern Trust deploys business and regional risk committees that also report into GERC.

Risk

Assessment, Appetite and Reporting Processes

As part of the integrated risk framework, Northern Trust has established key risk identification and risk management processes, embedded within its businesses to enable a risk-informed profile that supports its business decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies. Northern Trust’s risk assessment process consists of a series of programs across the first and second lines of defense that identify, measure, manage and report risks in line with risk appetite and guidelines.

Northern Trust defines its risk appetite as the aggregate level and types of risk the Board of Directors and senior management are willing to assume to achieve the Corporation’s strategic objectives and business plan, consistent with prudent management of risk and applicable capital, liquidity, and other regulatory requirements. It includes consideration of the likelihood and impact of risks, using both monetary loss and non-financial measures across risk themes to monitor against tolerance thresholds and guideline levels that trigger escalation to senior management.

Risk Control

Risk Control is an internal, independent review function within the Risk Management function. Risk Control is managed by the Head of Risk Control and is comprised of Model Risk Management, Credit Review, Global Compliance Testing and Basel Independent Verification groups, each with its own risk focus and oversight. Model Risk Management is responsible for the implementation and management of the enterprise-wide model risk framework and independently validating new models and reviewing and re-validating existing models. Credit Review provides an independent, ongoing assessment of credit exposure and related credit risk management processes across Northern Trust. Global Compliance Testing evaluates the effectiveness of procedures and controls designed to comply with relevant laws and regulations, as well as corresponding Northern Trust policies governing regulatory compliance activities. Lastly, Basel Independent Verification promotes rigor and accuracy in Northern Trust’s ongoing compliance with Basel III requirements and adherence to Enhanced Prudential Standards, including liquidity stress testing. The Business Risk Committee has oversight responsibility with respect to Risk Control generally as well as each of these groups.

Audit Services

Audit Services is an independent control function that assesses and validates controls within Northern Trust’s risk management framework. Audit Services is managed by the Chief Audit Executive with oversight from the Audit Committee. Audit Services tests the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls associated with the advanced systems on an ongoing basis and reports the results of these audits directly to the Audit Committee. Audit Services includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. The Chief Audit Executive reports directly to the Audit Committee and the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and is a non-voting member of GERC.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk to interest income or principal from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to perform on an obligation.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Credit Risk Overview

Credit risk is inherent in many of Northern Trust’s activities. A significant component of credit risk relates to loans, leases, securities, and counterparty-related exposures. Northern Trust’s loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large U.S. financial institutions in that Northern Trust is generally:

•

not an originator of loan products to be sold into a secondary market or to be bundled into asset securitizations;

•

not an agent bank or syndicator of loans, where risk management is achieved post-close through the sale of participations; and

•

not a participant in leveraged financial transactions, such as project finance, private-equity-originated acquisition financing or hedge fund leveraging.

Credit Risk Framework and Governance

The Credit Risk Management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and, while independent of the businesses, it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive management of credit risk. To monitor and control credit risk, the Credit Risk Management function maintains a framework that consists of policies, standards, and programs designed to promote a prudent relationship-based credit culture. This function also monitors adherence to corporate policies, standards, programs, and external regulations.

The Credit Risk Management function provides a system of checks and balances for Northern Trust’s diverse credit-related activities by monitoring these activities and practices and promoting their uniform application throughout Northern Trust.

The credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit. Individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities. Credit requests exceeding individual authority because of amount, rating, term or other conditions, are referred to the relevant Group Credit Approval Committee. Credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the Senior Credit Committee. The Capital Markets Credit Committee has sole credit authority for the approval, modification, or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties.

The CRC establishes and monitors credit-related policies and programs throughout Northern Trust and promotes their uniform application. The Chief Credit Officer reports directly to the CRO and chairs the CRC. Independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework also is provided by Risk Control.

Credit Risk Measurement

An integral component of credit risk measurement is Northern Trust’s internal risk rating system. Northern Trust’s internal risk rating system enables identification, measurement, approval and monitoring of credit risk. Calculations include entity-specific information about the obligor’s or counterparty’s probability of default and exposure-specific information about loss given default, exposure at default and maturity.

The Credit Risk Management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal risk-rating system. Independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of Risk Control.

Loans and Other Extensions of Credit

A significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio, including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. These contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in the “Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements” section and in

Note 29, “Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments, Guarantees and Other Commitments”

to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

As part of Northern Trust’s credit processes, the Credit Risk Management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant and/or weaker-rated credits. This approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems. An integral part of the Credit Risk Management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits, if any, need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off. Northern Trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for adversely classified credit exposures that includes all nonperforming credits as well as other loans with elevated risk of default. Independent from the Credit Risk Management function, Credit Review undertakes both on-site and off-site file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of management’s implementation of the Credit Risk Management’s requirements.

Counterparty Credit Risk

Counterparty credit risk for Northern Trust primarily arises from a variety of funding, treasury, trading and custody-related activities, including over-the-counter (OTC) currency and interest rate derivatives, and from indemnified securities lending transactions. Credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

To calculate exposure, Northern Trust treats repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repo-style transactions. Foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as OTC derivatives. The exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure, including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants, is determined based on operational requirements, the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity.

Credit Risk Mitigation

Northern Trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for client-related credit exposures. However, Northern Trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure. Northern Trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories.

Physical and Financial Collateral:

Northern Trust’s primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral. Residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property. In cases where loans to commercial or certain Wealth Management clients are secured by marketable securities, the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies.

Netting:

On-balance-sheet netting is employed where applicable for counterparties with master netting agreements. Netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements. Northern Trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time.

Guarantees:

Personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect Northern Trust’s claims relative to other creditors. Northern Trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time.

Another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure, such as in any single (or small number of related) obligor/counterparty, loan type, industry, geography, country or risk mitigant. Processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits.

Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, human factors and systems, or from external events.

Operational Risk Overview

Operational risk is inherent in each of Northern Trust’s businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems, operating problems, product design and delivery difficulties, potential legal actions, or other catastrophes to result in losses. This includes the potential that continuity of service and resiliency may be impacted.

Operational risk includes compliance, fiduciary and legal risks, which under the Corporation’s risk structure are governed and managed explicitly.

Operational Risk Framework and Governance

To monitor and control operational risk, Northern Trust maintains a framework consisting of risk management policies, programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment and maintain the Corporation’s operational risk profile and losses within approved risk appetites and guidelines. The framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that influence risk and drive action to reduce future loss events. The Operational Risk Management function is responsible for defining the operational risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across Northern Trust. It is the responsibility of each business to implement the enterprise-wide operational risk framework and business-specific risk management programs to identify, monitor, measure, manage and report on operational risk and mitigate Northern Trust’s exposure to loss. Several key programs support the operational risk framework, including:

•

Loss Event Data Program

- a program that collects internal and external loss data for use in monitoring operational risk exposure, various business analyses and a Basel Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) capital quantification.

•

Risk and Control Self-Assessment

- a structured risk management process used by Northern Trust’s businesses to analyze the risks that are present in their respective business environments and to assess the adequacy of associated internal controls.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

•

Operational Risk Scenario Analysis

- a systematic process of obtaining expert opinions from business managers and risk management experts to derive reasoned assessments of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss impact of plausible high-severity operational losses.

•

Product and Process Risk Management Program

- a program used for evaluating and managing risks associated with the introduction of new and modified noncredit products and services, significant changes to operating processes, and related significant loss events.

•

Outsourcing Risk Management Program

- a program that provides processes for appropriate risk assessment, measurement, monitoring and management of outsourced technology and business process outsourcing.

•

Information Security and Technology Risk Management

- a program that communicates and implements compliance and risk management processes and controls to address information security, including cyber threats and technology risks to the organization.

•

Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Management Program

- a program designed to minimize business impact and support the resumption of mission critical functions for clients following an incident.

•

Physical Security

- a program that provides for the safety of Northern Trust partners, clients, and visitors worldwide.

•

Insurance Management Program

- a program designed to reduce the monetary impact of certain operational loss events.

As discussed in Risk Control, Model Risk Management also is part of the operational risk framework.

The ORC is responsible for overseeing the activities of Northern Trust related to the management of operational risk including establishing the Corporate Operational Risk Policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs. This committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks. The purpose of this committee is to provide executive management’s insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks.

Operational Risk Measurement

Northern Trust utilizes the AMA capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the Corporation and applicable U.S. banking subsidiaries. Northern Trust’s AMA capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the Loss Event Data, Risk and Control Self-Assessment and Operational Risk Scenario Analysis programs to derive required capital. Business environment factor information is used to estimate loss frequency. The AMA capital quantification process uses a Loss Distribution Approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 99.9

th

percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a one-year time horizon.

Information Security and Technology Management

Effective management of risks related to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is crucial in an environment of increasing cyber threat and requires a structured approach to establish and communicate expectations and required practices. Northern Trust’s information security and technology risk management framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and an Information Security and Technology Risk Management Policy and Program approved by the Business Risk Committee. The framework is supported by an organizational structure that reflects support from executive management and includes risk committees comprised of members from across the businesses, including the Information Security and Technology Risk Committee (ISTRC). The ISTRC is chaired by the Chief Information Risk Officer, who regularly reports to the Business Risk Committee on the status of the Information Security and Technology Risk Management Program.

In addition to a strong governance process, internal controls and risk management practices are designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to Northern Trust’s overall risk appetite and the inherent risk in the markets in which Northern Trust operates. Northern Trust employees are responsible for promoting information security as well as adhering to applicable policies and standards and other means provided to them to safeguard electronic information and business systems within their care. Training and awareness programs to educate employees on information security are ongoing and include multiple approaches such as mandatory computer-based training, phishing simulations, and the designation of individuals as Information Security and Privacy Champions within the businesses. In cases where Northern Trust relies on vendors to perform services, controls are routinely reviewed for alignment with industry standards and their ability to protect information. Any findings identified are remediated following a risk-based approach.

In addition to the various information security controls managed and monitored within the organization, Northern Trust uses external third-party security teams on a regular basis to assess effectiveness. These teams perform security program maturity assessments, penetration tests, security assessments and reviews of Northern Trust’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks such as spear phishing. Northern Trust operates a global security operations center for threat identification and response. This center aggregates security threat information from systems and platforms across the businesses, and alerts the organization in accordance with its documented Cyber Incident Response Plan.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Cyber Incident Response Plan is used to respond to cybersecurity incidents. A cybersecurity incident is defined as an incident caused by damaging activity, which requires actions to prevent and respond to disruptions, denials, compromises or exfiltration that impact the confidentiality, integrity and availably of the assets of Northern Trust or its clients. The plan provides a streamlined approach that can be invoked rapidly to address matters that raise enterprise concern and to communicate impact, actions and status to senior management, including the Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Information Risk Officer, and appropriate stakeholders. The plan is designed to work with enterprise-level response plans, and is reviewed, tested, and updated regularly.

Northern Trust's disclosure controls and procedures also address cybersecurity incidents and include elements to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from any such incidents. Northern Trust also maintains compliance programs to address the applicability of restrictions on securities trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information, including in instances in which such information may relate to cybersecurity incidents.

Business Resiliency and Continuity Management

Northern Trust’s business resiliency approach encompasses business continuity and disaster recovery processes enterprise-wide (including staff, technology and facilities) to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption Northern Trust resumes mission-critical business and economic functions and fulfills all regulatory and legal requirements.

Northern Trust’s business resiliency mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security, resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers, a highly redundant global network, robust network security, resiliency centers that offer alternative workstations, and transfer of work and work-from-home programs that provide further capability.

All of Northern Trust’s businesses are required to risk-assess their critical functions regularly and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements (people, systems, vendor relationships and other assets), arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards. The strength of the business continuity programs of all critical third-party vendors to Northern Trust are reviewed on a regular basis. All of Northern Trust’s businesses test their plans at least annually. The ORC annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the Business Risk Committee.

Northern Trust has also begun exploring the integration of climate-related scenario analyses into its broader risk management program to help align with certain recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Conducting such climate-related scenario analyses and assessing the magnitude of climate-related financial risks and opportunities related to Northern Trust's global assets are intended to position the organization to navigate uncertain climate futures more effectively.

Fiduciary Risk

Fiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients’ fiduciary accounts: i) to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws; or ii) to properly discharge fiduciary duties. Fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction, type of relationship and governing document.

Fiduciary Risk Overview

The fiduciary risk management framework identifies, assesses, measures, monitors and reports on fiduciary risk matters deemed significant. Fiduciary risk is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify, understand and keep such risk at levels consistent with the organization’s overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each relationship for which Northern Trust serves in a fiduciary capacity. Each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite level.

Fiduciary Risk Framework and Governance

The FRC is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities to identify, monitor, manage and report on fiduciary risk. In addition, the FRC serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization.

Compliance Risk

Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to Northern Trust. Compliance risk includes the following two subcategories:

•

Regulatory Risk - risk arising from failure to comply with prudential and conduct of business or other regulatory requirements.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

•

Financial Crime Risk - risk arising from financial crime (e.g., money laundering, sanctions violations, fraud, insider dealing, theft, etc.) in relation to the products, services, or accounts of the institution, its clients, or others associated with the same.

Compliance Risk Framework and Governance

The compliance risk management framework identifies, assesses, controls, measures, monitors and reports on compliance risk. The framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur. The framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a Compliance and Ethics Program approved by the Business Risk Committee.

Each business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the Compliance and Ethics Program and specific compliance policies within their respective businesses. Each business is responsible for its respective employees’ compliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with Northern Trust’s Compliance and Ethics Program.

The CEOC establishes and monitors adherence to Northern Trust’s Compliance and Ethics Program. The Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer reports to the Business Risk Committee, as appropriate, and chairs the CEOC.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due, because of firm-specific or market-wide stress events.

Liquidity Risk Overview

Northern Trust maintains a strong liquidity position and conservative liquidity risk profile. Northern Trust’s balance sheet is primarily liability-driven. That is, the main driver of balance sheet changes comes from changing levels of client deposits, which are generally related to the level of custody assets serviced and commercial and personal deposits. This liability-driven business model differs from a typical asset-driven business model, where increased levels of deposits and wholesale borrowings are required to support, for example, increased levels of lending. Northern Trust’s balance sheet is generally comprised of high-quality assets that are managed to meet anticipated obligations under stress, resulting in low liquidity risk.

Liquidity Risk Framework and Governance

Northern Trust maintains a liquidity risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the Board-approved Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. All liquidity risk activities are overseen by the Risk Management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.

The Liquidity Management Policy and exposure limits for liquidity risk are set by the Board, and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. Limits are monitored based on measures such as the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the liquidity stress-testing buffer across a range of time horizons. Treasury, in the first line of defense, proposes liquidity risk management strategies and is responsible for performing liquidity management activities.

The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, monitoring risk metrics, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as cash flows, LCR, and stress test results.

Market and Liquidity Risk Management, in the second line of defense, provides challenge to the first line activities, evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness, and escalates material items for corrective action. The MLRC provides second line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market and liquidity risk exposures, approving and monitoring risk metrics, and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive liquidity risk measurement.

Liquidity Risk Analysis, Monitoring, and Reporting

Liquidity risk is analyzed and monitored in order to ensure compliance with the approved risk appetite. Various liquidity analysis and monitoring activities are employed by Northern Trust to understand better the nature and sources of its liquidity risks, including: liquidity stress testing, liquidity metric monitoring, collateral management, intraday management, cash flow projections, operational deposit modeling, liquid asset buffer measurement, funds transfer pricing, and contingency funding planning.

The liquidity risk management process is supported through management and regulatory reporting. Both Northern Trust’s Treasury and Market and Liquidity Risk Management functions produce management reports that enable oversight bodies to make informed decisions and support management of liquidity risk within the approved risk appetite. Holistic liquidity metrics

such as LCR and internal liquidity stress testing are actively monitored, along with a suite of other metrics that provide early warning indicators of changes in the risk profile.

Market Risk

There are two types of market risk, interest rate risk and trading risk. Interest rate risk is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity. Trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions.

Market Risk Framework and Governance

Northern Trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the Board-approved Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. All market risk activities are overseen by the Risk Management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.

The Asset and Liability Management Policy, Policy on Dealer Trading Activities, and exposure limits for market risk are set by board-level committees, and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. Limits are monitored based on measures such as sensitivity of net interest income (NII), sensitivity of market value of equity (MVE), and Value-at-Risk (VaR) across a range of time horizons.

Treasury, in the first line of defense, proposes market risk management strategies and is responsible for performing market risk management activities. ALCO provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, monitoring risk metrics, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as stress test results.

Market and Liquidity Risk Management, in the second line of defense, provides challenge to the first line activities, evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness, and escalates material items for corrective action. The MLRC provides second line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market risk exposures, establishing and monitoring risk metrics, and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive market risk measurement.

Interest Rate Risk Overview

Interest rate risk in the banking book is the potential for deterioration in Northern Trust's financial position (e.g. interest income, market value of equity, or capital) due to changes in interest rates. NII and MVE sensitivity are the primary metrics used for measurement and management of interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on NII depending on the positioning of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet instruments. Changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet positions, which indirectly impact the MVE. To mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities (adjusted for hedges) are sufficiently correlated, which allows Northern Trust to manage its interest rate risk within its risk appetite.

There are four commonly recognized types of interest rate risk in the banking book:

•

repricing, which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities;

•

yield curve, which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve;

•

basis, which arises from imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics; and

•

embedded optionality, which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes.

Interest Rate Risk Analysis, Monitoring, and Reporting

Northern Trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: NII and MVE sensitivity. NII sensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on NII. MVE sensitivity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on MVE based on the period-end balance sheet.

Northern Trust limits aggregate interest rate risk (as measured by the NII sensitivity and MVE sensitivity simulation techniques) to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite. A variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including:

•

purchase of securities;

•

sale of debt securities that are classified as available for sale;

•

issuance of senior notes and subordinated notes;

•

collateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank;

•

placing and taking Eurodollar time deposits; and

•

hedging with various types of derivative financial instruments.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NII Sensitivity

The modeling of NII sensitivity incorporates on-balance-sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. Northern Trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e., change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk).

The NII sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate NII sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. The following key assumptions are incorporated into the NII simulation:

•

the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment;

•

prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions;

•

cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor;

•

nonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on Northern Trust’s actual historical patterns and management judgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies/or judgment; and

•

new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices.

The following table shows the estimated NII impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point upward and 100 basis point downward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates. Each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period.

TABLE 55: NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2019

The NII sensitivity analysis does not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movement. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. NII sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided.

MVE Sensitivity

MVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities, net of the value of financial derivatives that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items. The potential effect of interest rate changes on MVE is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit. Northern Trust uses current market rates (and the future rates implied by these market rates) as the base case and measures MVE sensitivity under various rate scenarios. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk).

The MVE sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate MVE sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. Many of the assumptions that apply to NII sensitivity also apply to MVE sensitivity simulations, with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the MVE simulation:


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

•

the present value of nonmaturity deposits are estimated using

dynamic decay methodologies or estimated

remaining lives, which are based on a combination of Northern Trust’s actual historical runoff patterns and management judgment—some balances are assumed to be core and have longer lives while other balances are assumed to be temporary and have comparatively shorter lives;

•

the present values of most noninterest-related balances (such as receivables, equipment, and payables) are the same as their book values; and

•

Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate forward interest rate paths.

The following table shows the estimated impact on MVE of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up and a 100 basis point shock down from current market implied forward rates.

TABLE 56: MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY SENSITIVITY AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2019

The MVE simulations do not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movements. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. MVE sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided.

Foreign Currency Risk Overview

Northern Trust's balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries, and future non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expense. To manage currency exposures on the balance sheet, Northern Trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency. If those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet, Northern Trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure. Foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce Northern Trust’s currency exposure to future non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expense.

In addition, Northern Trust provides global foreign exchange (GFX) services to clients. Most of these services are provided in connection with Northern Trust’s growing global custody business. In the normal course of business, Northern Trust also engages in trading of non-U.S. currencies for its own account. Both activities are considered trading activities.

Foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other in amount, or offset each other over different time periods. The GFX trading portfolio at Northern Trust is composed of spot, forward, and non-deliverable foreign currency transactions. For GFX, spot risk is driven primarily by foreign exchange rate (FX) risk, and forward risk is driven primarily by interest rate (IR) risk.

Foreign Currency Risk Measurement

Northern Trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-U.S. currency positions using a VaR model and applying the historical simulation methodology. This statistical model provides estimates, based on a variety of high confidence levels, of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in non-U.S. currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days. The model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies. VaR is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio.

VaR measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions from Northern Trust’s trading systems each day. Data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies. The Risk Management function monitors on a daily basis VaR model inputs and outputs for reasonableness.

Foreign Currency Risk Monitoring, Reporting and Analysis

Northern Trust monitors several variations of the GFX VaR measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs. Variations include different methodologies (historical simulation, Monte Carlo simulation and Taylor approximation), horizons of one day and ten days, confidence levels of 95% and 99%, subcomponent VaRs using only FX drivers and only


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IR drivers, and look back periods of one year, two years, and four years. Those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on Northern Trust’s market risks.

Automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers. The Risk Management function also reviews and reports several variations of the VaR measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk.

The table below presents the levels of total regulatory VaR and its subcomponents for GFX in the years indicated below, based on the historical simulation methodology, a 99% confidence level, a one-day horizon and equally-weighted volatility. The total VaR for GFX is typically less than the sum of its two subcomponents due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents.

TABLE 57: GLOBAL FOREIGN CURRENCY VALUE-AT-RISK

During


, Northern Trust experienced one day of actual GFX trading loss in excess of the daily GFX VaR estimate. During


, Northern Trust did not incur an actual GFX trading loss in excess of the daily GFX VaR estimate.

Other Nonmaterial Trading Activities

Market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible. Northern Trust’s broker-dealer subsidiary, Northern Trust Securities, Inc., maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes, which averaged

$1.2 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2019

.

Northern Trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps and swaptions entered into to meet clients’ interest rate management needs, but also including a small number of caps and floors. All interest rate derivative transactions are executed by Northern Trust's Treasury department. When Northern Trust enters into client transactions, its practice is to mitigate the resulting market risk with offsetting interbank derivative transactions with matching terms and maturities.

Strategic Risk

Strategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy ineffective or unachievable. The consequences of strategic risk can be diminished long-term earnings and capital, as well as reputational damage to the firm. Strategic risk includes the following three subcategories:

•

Macroeconomic and geopolitical risk, which centers on events or themes that would have a significant, detrimental impact on financial markets, and by extension, financial services firms. Episodes of this kind would tend to have general, as opposed to idiosyncratic, consequences.

•

Business risk, which arises from change in the following areas:

•

Internal: situations within Northern Trust that threaten business continuity, profitability, or the achievement of strategic objectives

•

Secular: behavioral or technological change that affects clients and renders a Northern Trust process or service obsolete

•

Competitive: new products or shifts in the industry landscape that challenge Northern Trust’s performance

•

Regulatory: changes to prudential or fiscal policy that have an adverse impact on Northern Trust or its clients

•

Reputation risk is a residual risk which arises from negative perception on the part of clients, counterparties, stockholders, investors, debt holders, market analysts, regulators, staff, or other relevant parties that adversely affects Northern Trust’s ability to conduct its business. Reputation risk can arise from a range of risk events and is not limited to strategic risk.

Strategic Risk Framework and Governance

Northern Trust maintains a framework that consists of risk management policies and practices designed to identify, analyze, and limit (where possible) the impact of strategic risk. The Strategic Risk Management function is responsible for defining this framework and providing independent oversight of its application across Northern Trust. In furtherance of this effort, Northern Trust has established governance around its strategic planning processes to review and challenge strategic decisions.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In addition, Northern Trust maintains a Global Stress Testing Framework which guides stress testing exercises across the company. Enterprise stress testing, a component of this effort, is specifically designed to look at the prospective impact of internal and external shocks on the organization. Northern Trust also maintains the Global Emergency Response Plan, which guides its reaction to adverse external events if they arise.

Both GERC and the Business Risk Committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods, guidelines and policies by which Northern Trust monitors and controls strategic risk.

Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent

The following table presents a reconciliation of interest income, net interest income, net interest margin, and total revenue prepared in accordance with GAAP to such measures on an FTE basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.

ACCOUNTING

FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Northern Trust Corporation and subsidiaries (the Corporation) as of

December 31, 2019

and


, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2019

, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of

December 31, 2019

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2019

, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated

February 25, 2020

expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgment. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Assessment of the allowance for credit losses related to loans and leases collectively evaluated for inherent impairment

As discussed in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation’s allowance for credit losses related to loans and leases collectively evaluated for inherent impairment (ALLL) was $99.5 million of a total allowance for credit losses of $104.5 million as of December 31, 2019. The ALLL is estimated using a historical loss methodology that estimates the probability of default and loss given default for all loans and leases. The ALLL also incorporates adjustments in accordance with the Corporation’s qualitative adjustment framework.


We identified the assessment of the ALLL as a critical audit matter because it involved significant measurement uncertainty regarding complex auditor judgment, and knowledge and experience in the industry. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. The assessment of the ALLL encompassed the evaluation of the ALLL methodology, including the methodologies used to estimate the probability of default and loss given default, and their key factors and assumptions, including the borrower ratings, the historical observation period, and the loss emergence period. The assessment also included an evaluation of the ALLL calculations.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Corporation’s ALLL process, including controls related to the (1) development of the ALLL methodology, (2) determination of key factors and assumptions used to estimate the probability of default and loss given default, and (3) calculations of the ALLL estimate. We evaluated the Corporation’s process to develop the ALLL estimate by testing certain source data, factors and assumptions that the Corporation used and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized industry knowledge and experience, who assisted in:

•

evaluating the Corporation’s ALLL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,

•

testing the historical observation period assumption used in the probability of default and loss given default methodologies to evaluate the length of the periods,

•

testing borrower ratings for a selection of loan relationships by evaluating financial performance of the borrower and underlying collateral,

•

evaluating the methodology used to develop the probability of default, loss emergence period, and loss given default assumptions, and

•

evaluating the ALLL calculations, including testing the mathematical accuracy of certain key assumption calculations.

We evaluated the collective results of the procedures performed to assess the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the Corporation’s ALLL.

We have served as the Corporation’s auditor since 2002.

Note 1 –

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and reporting practices prescribed for the banking industry. A description of the more significant accounting policies follows.

A.

Basis of Presentation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Northern Trust Company (Bank), and various other wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation and Bank. Throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the term “Northern Trust” refers to the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated statements of income include results of acquired subsidiaries from the dates of acquisition. Certain prior-year balances have been reclassified consistent with the current year’s presentation.

B.

Nature of Operations.

The Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Bank is an Illinois banking corporation headquartered in Chicago and the Corporation’s principal subsidiary. The Corporation conducts business in the United States (U.S.) and internationally through various U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, including the Bank.

Northern Trust generates the majority of its revenue from its

two

client-focused reporting segments: Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C&IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business.

C&IS is a leading global provider of asset servicing and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors around the globe. Asset servicing and related services encompass a full range of capabilities including but not limited to: global custody; fund administration; investment operations outsourcing; investment management; investment risk and analytical services; employee benefit services; securities lending; foreign exchange; treasury management; brokerage services; transition management services; banking and cash management. Client relationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support from locations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.

Wealth Management focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. The business also includes the Global Family Office, which provides customized services to meet the complex financial needs of individuals and family offices in the U.S. and throughout the world with assets typically exceeding

$


million

. In supporting these targeted segments, Wealth Management provides trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services; financial consulting; guardianship and estate administration; family business consulting; family financial education; brokerage services; and private and business banking. Wealth Management services are delivered by multidisciplinary teams through a network of offices in


U.S. states and Washington, D.C., as well as offices in London, Guernsey, and Abu Dhabi.

C.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain of our significant accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

D.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Translation.

Asset and liability accounts denominated in nonfunctional currencies are remeasured into functional currencies at period-end rates of exchange, except for certain balance sheet items including but not limited to buildings and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Results from remeasurement of asset and liability accounts are reported in other operating income as currency translation gains (losses), net. Income and expense accounts are remeasured at period-average rates of exchange.

Asset and liability accounts of entities with functional currencies that are not the U.S. dollar are translated at period-end rates of exchange. Income and expense accounts are translated at period-average rates of exchange. Translation adjustments, net of applicable taxes, are reported directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), a component of stockholders’ equity.

E.

Securities.

Securities Available for Sale

are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses credited or charged, net of the tax effect, to AOCI. Realized gains and losses on securities available for sale are determined on a specific identification

basis and are reported within other security gains (losses), net, in the consolidated statements of income. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of discount.

Securities Held to Maturity

consist of debt securities that management intends to, and Northern Trust has the ability to, hold until maturity. Such securities are reported at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of discount.

Securities Held for Trading

are stated at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities held for trading are reported in the consolidated statements of income within security commissions and trading income.

Nonmarketable Securities

primarily consist of Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and community development investments, each of which are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and Federal Home Loan Bank stock are reported at cost, which represents redemption value. Community development investments are typically reported at amortized cost. Those community development investments that are designed to generate a return primarily through realization of tax credits and other tax benefits, which are discussed in further detail in Note 30, “Variable Interest Entities,” are reported at amortized cost using the effective yield method or proportional amortization method and amortized over the lives of the related tax credits and other tax benefits.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment (OTTI).

A security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the credit loss) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or more-likely-than-not will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If OTTI exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of credit loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and it is more-likely-than-not that it will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in AOCI, net of applicable taxes. Otherwise, the entire difference between fair value and amortized cost is charged to earnings.

F.

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until the repurchase.

G.

Derivative Financial Instruments.

Northern Trust is a party to various derivative financial instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients, as part of its trading activity for its own account, and as part of its risk management activities. These instruments generally include foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts, total return swap contracts and credit default swap contracts. All derivative financial instruments, whether designated as hedges or not, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value within Other Assets and Other Liabilities. Derivative asset and liability positions with the same counterparty are reflected on a net basis on the consolidated balance sheets in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist. These derivative assets and liabilities are further reduced by cash collateral received from, and deposited with, derivative counterparties. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative in the consolidated statements of income depends on whether or not the contract has been designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting under GAAP. Derivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated statements of cash flows within the line item, “other operating activities, net,” except for net investment hedges which are recorded within “other investing activities, net”.

Changes in the fair value of client-related and trading derivative instruments, which are not designated hedges under GAAP, are recognized currently in either foreign exchange trading income or security commissions and trading income. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes but not designated as hedges are recognized currently in other operating income. Certain derivative instruments used by Northern Trust to manage risk are formally designated and qualify for hedge accounting as fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedges.

Derivatives designated as fair value hedges are used to limit Northern Trust’s exposure to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recognized currently in interest income or interest expense. For substantially all fair value hedges, Northern Trust applies the “shortcut” method of accounting, available under GAAP. As a result, changes recorded in the fair value of the hedged item are assumed to equal the offsetting gain or loss on the derivative. For fair value hedges that do not qualify for the “shortcut” method of accounting, Northern Trust utilizes regression analysis, a “long-haul” method of accounting, in assessing whether these hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and quarterly thereafter.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are used to minimize the variability in cash flows of earning assets or forecasted transactions caused by movements in interest or foreign exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of such derivatives are recognized in AOCI, a component of stockholders’ equity, and there is no change to the accounting for the hedged item. Balances in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings, and are reflected in the same income statement line item. Northern Trust applies the “shortcut” method of accounting for cash flow hedges of certain available for sale investment securities. For cash flow hedges of certain other available for sale investment securities, foreign currency denominated investment securities, and forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions, Northern Trust closely matches all terms of the hedged item and hedging derivative at inception and on an ongoing basis. For cash flow hedges of available for sale investment securities, to the extent all terms are not perfectly matched, effectiveness is assessed using regression analysis. For cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions and investment securities, to the extent all terms are not perfectly matched, effectiveness is assessed using the dollar-offset method.

Foreign exchange contracts and qualifying non-derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are used to minimize Northern Trust’s exposure to variability in the foreign currency translation of net investments in non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in AOCI consistent with the related translation gains and losses of the hedged net investment. For net investment hedges, all critical terms of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are matched at inception and on an ongoing basis. Amounts recorded in AOCI are reclassified to earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of an investment in a non-U.S. branch or subsidiary.

Fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges are designated and formally documented as such contemporaneous with the transaction. The formal documentation describes the hedge relationship and identifies the hedging instruments and hedged items. Included in the documentation is a discussion of the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking such hedges, the nature of the risk being hedged, and a description of the method for assessing hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis. For hedges that do not qualify for the “shortcut” or the critical terms match methods of accounting, a formal assessment is performed on a calendar quarter basis to verify that derivatives used in hedging transactions continue to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge accounting is discontinued if a derivative ceases to be highly effective, matures, is terminated or sold, if a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, or if Northern Trust removes the derivative’s hedge designation. Subsequent gains and losses on these derivatives are included in foreign exchange trading income or security commissions and trading income. For discontinued cash flow hedges, the accumulated gain or loss on the derivative remains in AOCI and is reclassified to earnings in the period in which the previously hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings or is no longer probable of occurring. For discontinued fair value hedges, the previously hedged asset or liability ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value. Previous adjustments to the hedged item are amortized over the remaining life of the hedged item.

H.

Loans and Leases.

Loans and leases are recognized assets that represent a contractual right to receive money either on demand or on fixed or determinable dates. Loans and leases are disaggregated for disclosure purposes by portfolio segment (segment) and by class. Northern Trust has defined its segments as commercial and personal. A class of loans and leases is a subset of a segment, the components of which have similar risk characteristics, measurement attributes, or risk monitoring methods. The classes within the commercial segment have been defined as commercial and institutional, commercial real estate, lease financing, net, non-U.S. and other. The classes within the personal segment have been defined as residential real estate, private client and other.

Loan Classification.

Loans that are held for investment are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income. Loans classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value. Undrawn commitments relating to loans that are not held for sale are recorded in Other Liabilities and are carried at the amount of unamortized fees with an allowance for credit loss liability recognized for any estimated probable losses.

Recognition of Income.

Interest income on loans is recorded on an accrual basis unless, in the opinion of management, there is a question as to the ability of the debtor to meet the terms of the loan agreement, or interest or principal is more than


days

contractually past due and the loan is not well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans meeting such criteria are classified as nonperforming and interest income is recorded on a cash basis. Past due status is based on how long since the contractual due date a principal or interest payment has been past due. For disclosure purposes, loans that are


days

past due or less are reported as current. At the time a loan is determined to be nonperforming, interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income in the current period. Interest collected on nonperforming loans is applied to principal unless, in the opinion of management, collectability of principal is not in doubt. Management’s assessment of indicators of loan and lease collectability, and its policies relative to the recognition of interest income, including the suspension and subsequent resumption of income recognition, do not meaningfully vary between loan and lease classes. Nonperforming loans are returned to performing status when factors indicating doubtful collectability no longer exist. Factors considered in returning a loan to performing status are consistent across all classes of loans and leases and, in accordance with regulatory guidance, relate


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

primarily to expected payment performance. A loan is eligible to be returned to performing status when: (i) no principal or interest that is due is unpaid and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected or (ii) the loan has otherwise become well-secured (possessing realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt, including accrued interest, in full) and is in the process of collection (through action reasonably expected to result in debt repayment or restoration to a current status in the near future). A loan that has not been brought fully current may be restored to performing status provided there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally a minimum of

six

payment periods) by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms, and Northern Trust is reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period of time. Additionally, a loan that has been formally restructured so as to be reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to its modified terms may be returned to accrual status, provided there was a well-documented credit evaluation of the borrower’s financial condition and prospects of repayment under the revised terms, and there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally a minimum of

six

payment periods) under the revised terms.

Impaired Loans.

A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, management determines that it is probable that Northern Trust will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are identified through ongoing credit management and risk rating processes, including the formal review of past due and watch list credits. Payment performance and delinquency status are critical factors in identifying impairment for all loans and leases, particularly those within the residential real estate, private client and personal-other classes. Other key factors considered in identifying impairment of loans and leases within the commercial and institutional, lease financing, net, non-U.S., and commercial-other classes relate to the borrower’s ability to perform under the terms of the obligation as measured through the assessment of future cash flows, including consideration of collateral value, market value, and other factors. A loan is also considered to be impaired if its terms have been modified as a concession by Northern Trust or a bankruptcy court resulting from the debtor’s financial difficulties, referred to as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). All TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the calendar year of their restructuring. In subsequent years, a TDR may cease being reported as impaired if the loan was modified at a market rate and has performed according to the modified terms for at least

six

payment periods. A loan that has been modified at a below market rate will return to performing status if it satisfies the

six

-payment-period performance requirement; however, it will remain reported as impaired. Impairment is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, or the loan's observable market value. If the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan, based on the certainty of loss, either a specific allowance is established, or a charge-off is recorded, for the difference. Smaller balance (individually less than

$


million

) homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards. Northern Trust’s accounting policies for material impaired loans is consistent across all classes of loans and leases.

Premium, Discounts, Origination Costs and Fees.

Premiums and discounts on loans are recognized as an adjustment of yield using the interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan. Certain direct origination costs and fees are netted, deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to the loan’s yield.

Direct Financing and Leveraged Leases.

Unearned lease income from direct financing and leveraged leases is recognized using the interest method. This method provides a constant rate of return on the unrecovered investment over the life of the lease. The rate of return and the allocation of income over the lease term are recalculated from the inception of the lease if during the lease term assumptions regarding the amount or timing of estimated cash flows change. Lease residual values are established at the inception of the lease based on in-house valuations and market analyses provided by outside parties. Lease residual values are reviewed at least annually for OTTI. A decline in the estimated residual value of a leased asset determined to be other-than-temporary would be recorded in the period in which the decline is identified as a reduction of interest income.

I.

Allowance for Credit Losses.

The allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. The loan and lease portfolio and other lending-related credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses. In determining an appropriate allowance level, Northern Trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lending-related commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lending-related credit exposures. The allowance for credit losses consists of the following components:

Specific Allowance.

The specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows, the value of collateral, and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay. For impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance, if any, is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management. These appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral.

Inherent Allowance.

The inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss data specific to the Northern Trust loan and lease portfolio. The estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

segregate the loan and lease portfolio into homogeneous segments. For each segment, the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance. The quantitative inherent allowance is then reviewed within the qualitative adjustment framework, where management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not fully contemplated in the quantitative methodology to compute an adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio.

The results of the inherent allowance estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by Northern Trust’s Loan Loss Reserve Committee, which includes representatives from Credit Risk Management, reporting segment management, and Corporate Finance.

Loans, leases, and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Northern Trust’s policies relative to the charging-off of uncollectible loans and leases are consistent across both loan and lease segments. Determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are charged-off or a specific reserve is established are based on management’s assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss. The provision for credit losses, which is charged to income, is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level determined to be appropriate through the above processes. Actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater or less than actual net charge-offs.

Northern Trust analyzes its exposure to credit losses from both on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet activity using a consistent methodology.

For purposes of estimating the allowance for credit losses for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit, the exposure at default includes an estimated drawdown of unused credit based on a credit conversion factor. The proportionate amount of the quantitative methodology calculation after any required adjustment in the qualitative framework results in the required allowance for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit as of the reporting date.

The portion of the allowance assigned to loans and leases is reported as a contra asset, directly following loans and leases in the consolidated balance sheets. The portion of the allowance assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit is reported in Other Liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

J.

Standby Letters of Credit.

Fees on standby letters of credit are recognized in other operating income using the straight-line method over the lives of the underlying agreements. Northern Trust’s recorded other liability for standby letters of credit, reflecting the obligation it has undertaken, is measured as the amount of unamortized fees on these instruments.

K.

Buildings and Equipment.

Buildings and equipment owned are carried at original cost less accumulated depreciation. The charge for depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the following range of lives: buildings – up to


years

; equipment –


to


years

; and leasehold improvements – the shorter of the lease term or


years

. Leased properties meeting certain criteria are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the lease period.

L. Other Real Estate Owned (OREO)

.

OREO is comprised of commercial and residential real estate properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans. OREO assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell and are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Fair value is typically based on third-party appraisals. Appraisals of OREO properties are updated on an annual basis and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the properties. Losses identified during the 90-day period after the acquisition of such properties are charged against the allowance for credit losses assigned to loans and leases. Subsequent write-downs that may be required to the carrying value of these assets and gains or losses realized from asset sales are recorded within other operating expense.

M.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Goodwill is not subject to amortization. Separately identifiable acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, primarily on a straight-line basis. Purchased software, software licenses, and allowable internal costs, including compensation relating to software developed for internal use, are capitalized. Software is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from


to


years

. Fees paid for the use of software licenses that are not hosted by Northern Trust are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

N.

Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees.

Trust, investment and other servicing fees are recorded on an accrual basis, over the period in which the service is provided. Fees are primarily a function of the market value of assets custodied, managed and serviced, transaction volumes, and securities lending volume and spreads, as set forth in the underlying client


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

agreement. This revenue recognition involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including components that are calculated based on estimated asset valuations and transaction volumes.

O.

Client Security Settlement Receivables.

These receivables result from custody client withdrawals from short-term investment funds that settle on the following business day as well as custody client security sales executed under contractual settlement date accounting that have not yet settled. Northern Trust advances cash to the client on the date of either client withdrawal or trade execution and awaits collection from either the short-term investment funds or via the settled trade.

P.

Income Taxes.

Northern Trust follows an asset and liability approach to account for income taxes. The objective is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax rates.

Tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are evaluated based on their likelihood of being sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Only tax positions that are considered more-likely-than-not to be sustained are recorded in the consolidated financial statements. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion will not be realized. Northern Trust recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.

Q.

Cash Flow Statements.

Cash and cash equivalents have been defined as “Cash and Due from Banks”.

R.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits.

Northern Trust records the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets. Funded pension and postretirement benefits are reported in Other Assets and unfunded pension and postretirement benefits are reported in Other Liabilities. Plan assets and benefit obligations are measured annually at December 31. Plan assets are determined based on fair value generally representing observable market prices. The projected benefit obligations are determined based on the present value of projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate. Pension costs are recognized ratably over the estimated working lifetime of eligible participants.

S.

Share-Based Compensation Plans.

Northern Trust recognizes as compensation expense the grant-date fair value of stock and stock unit awards and other share-based compensation granted to employees within the consolidated statements of income. The fair values of stock and stock unit awards, including performance stock unit awards and director awards, are based on the closing price of the Corporation’s stock on the date of grant adjusted for certain awards that do not accrue dividends while vesting. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model utilizes weighted-average assumptions regarding the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding (expected term) based primarily on the historical exercise behavior attributable to previous option grants, the estimated yield from dividends paid on the Corporation’s stock over the expected term of the options, the historical volatility of Northern Trust’s stock price and the implied volatility of traded options on Northern Trust stock, and a risk free interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for a period equal to the expected term of the options granted.

Compensation expense for share-based award grants with terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule, whereby portions of the award vest in increments over the requisite service period, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Compensation expense for performance stock unit awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on expected achievement of the performance condition. Adjustments are made for employees that meet certain eligibility criteria at the grant date or during the requisite service period.

Northern Trust does not include an estimate of future forfeitures in its recognition of share-based compensation expense. Share-based compensation expense is adjusted based on forfeitures as they occur. Dividend equivalents are paid on a current basis for restricted stock units granted prior to February 21, 2017 that are not yet vested. Dividend equivalents are accrued for performance stock unit awards, most restricted stock units granted on or after February 21, 2017 and director awards not yet vested, and are paid upon vesting. Certain restricted stock units granted on or after February 20, 2018 are not entitled to dividend equivalents during the vesting period. Cash flows resulting from the realization of excess tax benefits are classified as operating cash flows.

T.

Net Income Per Common Share.

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income/loss applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock and potential common shares by the aggregate of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and common share equivalents calculated for stock options outstanding using the treasury stock method. In a period of a net loss, diluted net income per common share is calculated in the same manner as basic net income per common share.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Northern Trust has issued certain restricted stock unit awards, which are unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. These units are considered participating securities. Accordingly, Northern Trust calculates net income applicable to common stock using the two-class method, whereby net income is allocated between common stock and participating securities.

Note 2 –

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2019, Northern Trust adopted ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)" (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet, with certain specified scope exceptions. Specifically within the lessee model under ASU 2016-02, a lessee is required

to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make future lease payments, known as the lease liability, and a right-of-use asset (ROU asset)

representing its right to use the underlying asset over the lease term. Upon adoption, Northern Trust elected the package of practical expedients available under ASU 2016-02, which allowed Northern Trust to forego a reassessment of (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) the initial direct costs for any existing leases.

As a result of adopting ASU 2016-02, Northern Trust recognized operating lease liabilities and ROU assets of approximately

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively.

Northern Trust did not restate comparative periods for the effects of applying ASU 2016-02. There was no significant impact to Northern Trust’s consolidated results of operations.

Please refer to Note 10, “Lease Commitments” for further information.

On January 1, 2019, Northern Trust adopted ASU No. 2017-08, “Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Securities” (ASU 2017-08).

ASU 2017-08 amends the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium and shortens the amortization period for the premium to the earliest call date. Upon adoption of ASU 2017-08, there was no significant impact to Northern Trust’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

On January 1, 2019, Northern Trust adopted ASU No. 2018-16, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes” (ASU 2018-16).

ASU 2018-16 permits use of the OIS rate based on SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815. Upon adoption of ASU 2018-16, there was no significant impact to Northern Trust’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Note 3 –

Fair Value Measurements

Fair value under GAAP is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.

Fair Value Hierarchy.

The following describes the hierarchy of valuation inputs (Levels 1, 2, and 3) used to measure fair value and the primary valuation methodologies used by Northern Trust for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity; unobservable inputs reflect the entity’s own assumptions about how market participants would value an asset or liability based on the best information available. GAAP requires an entity measuring fair value to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and establishes a fair value hierarchy of inputs. Financial instruments are categorized within the hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to their valuation. Northern Trust’s policy is to recognize transfers into and transfers out of fair value levels as of the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred. No transfers between fair value levels occurred during the years ended

December 31, 2019

, or


.

Level 1 – Quoted, active market prices for identical assets or liabilities.

Northern Trust’s Level 1 assets are comprised of available for sale investments in U.S. treasury securities.

Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted active market prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.

Northern Trust’s Level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account debt securities, the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors. Prices received from vendors are compared to other vendor and third-party prices. If a security price obtained from a pricing vendor is determined to exceed pre-determined tolerance levels that are assigned based on an asset type’s characteristics, the exception is researched and, if the price is not able to be validated, an alternate pricing vendor is utilized, consistent with Northern Trust’s pricing source hierarchy. As of

December 31, 2019

, Northern Trust’s available for sale debt securities portfolio included

1,704

Level 2 securities with an aggregate market value of

$

34.3

billion

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

account debt securities, which totaled

$

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, were all valued using external pricing vendors.

Northern Trust has established processes and procedures to assess the suitability of valuation methodologies used by external pricing vendors, including reviews of valuation techniques and assumptions used for selected securities. On a daily basis, periodic quality control reviews of prices received from vendors are conducted which include comparisons to prices on similar security types received from multiple pricing vendors and to the previous day’s reported prices for each security. Predetermined tolerance level exceptions are researched and may result in additional validation through available market information or the use of an alternate pricing vendor. Quarterly, Northern Trust reviews documentation from third-party pricing vendors regarding the valuation processes and assumptions used in their valuations and assesses whether the fair value levels assigned by Northern Trust to each security classification are appropriate. Annually, valuation inputs used within third-party pricing vendor valuations are reviewed for propriety on a sample basis through a comparison of inputs used to comparable market data, including security classifications that are less actively traded and security classifications comprising significant portions of the portfolio.

Level 2 assets and liabilities also include derivative contracts which are valued internally using widely accepted income-based models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect the contractual terms of the contracts. Observable inputs include foreign exchange rates and interest rates for foreign exchange contracts; credit spreads, default probabilities, and recovery rates for credit default swap contracts; interest rates for interest rate swap contracts and forward contracts; and interest rates and volatility inputs for interest rate option contracts. Northern Trust evaluates the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of its derivative instruments. Factors considered include the likelihood of default by Northern Trust and its counterparties, the remaining maturities of the instruments, net exposures after giving effect to master netting arrangements or similar agreements, available collateral, and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments. The resulting valuation adjustments have not been considered material.

Level 3 – Valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace.

Northern Trust’s Level 3 liabilities consist of swaps that Northern Trust entered into with the purchaser of

1.1

million

and

1.0

million

shares of Visa Inc. Class B common stock (Visa Class B common shares) previously held by Northern Trust and sold in June 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pursuant to the swaps, Northern Trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into shares of Visa Inc. Class A common stock (Visa Class A common shares), such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and Northern Trust will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. The swap also requires periodic payments from Northern Trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of Visa Class A common shares and a fixed rate of interest. The fair value of the swap is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are Northern Trust’s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares, the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the Visa Class A common share price. See “Visa Class B Common Shares” under Note 26, “Contingent Liabilities,” for further information.

Northern Trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate; however, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to Level 3 assets and liabilities, could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values.

Management of various businesses and departments of Northern Trust (including Corporate Market Risk, Credit Risk Management, Corporate Finance, C&IS and Wealth Management) reviews valuation methods and models for Level 3 assets and liabilities. Fair value measurements are performed upon acquisitions of an asset or liability. Management of the appropriate business or department reviews assumed inputs, especially when unobservable in the marketplace, in order to substantiate their use in each fair value measurement. When appropriate, management reviews forecasts used in the valuation process in light of other relevant financial projections to understand any variances between current and previous fair value measurements. In certain circumstances, third party information is used to support the fair value measurements. If certain third party information seems inconsistent with consensus views, a review of the information is performed by management of the respective business or department to determine the appropriate fair value of the asset or liability.

Carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis may be adjusted to fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition, for example, to record an impairment of an asset. GAAP requires entities to separately disclose these subsequent fair value measurements and to classify them under the fair value hierarchy.

Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at

December 31, 2019

and


, all of which were categorized as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy, were comprised of impaired loans whose values were based on real estate and other available collateral, and of OREO properties. Fair values of real estate loan collateral were estimated using a market approach typically supported by third-party valuations and property-specific fees and taxes, and were subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to realizable value. Other loan collateral, which typically consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, is valued using a market approach adjusted for asset specific characteristics and in limited instances third-party valuations are used.

189.5

million

. Unrealized losses of

$

78.1

million

and

$

13.3

million

related to government sponsored agency and obligations of states and political subdivisions, respectively, are primarily attributable to changes in market rates since their purchase.

The majority of the

$

73.3

million

of unrealized losses in debt securities classified as “other” at

December 31, 2019

related to debt securities primarily purchased at a premium or par by Northern Trust to fulfill its obligations under the CRA. Unrealized losses on these CRA-related securities are attributable to yields that are below market rates for the purpose of supporting institutions and programs that benefit low- to moderate-income communities within Northern Trust’s market area. The remaining unrealized losses on Northern Trust’s securities portfolio as of

December 31, 2019

were attributable to changes in overall market interest rates, increased credit spreads, or reduced market liquidity. As of

December 31, 2019

, Northern Trust did not intend to sell any investment in an unrealized loss position and it was more likely than not that Northern Trust would not be required to sell any such investment before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.

Security impairment reviews are conducted quarterly to identify and evaluate securities that have indications of possible OTTI. A determination as to whether a security’s decline in market value is other-than-temporary takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security. Factors Northern Trust considers in determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary include, but are not limited to, the length of time the security has been impaired; the severity of the impairment; the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; activity in the market of the issuer which may indicate adverse credit conditions; Northern Trust’s intent regarding


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the sale of the security as of the balance sheet date; and the likelihood that it will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. For each security meeting the requirements of Northern Trust’s internal screening process, an extensive review is conducted to determine if OTTI has occurred.

While all securities are considered, the process for identifying credit impairment within CRA-eligible mortgage-backed securities, a security type for which Northern Trust has recognized OTTI in


and


, incorporates an expected loss approach using discounted cash flows on the underlying collateral pools. To evaluate whether an unrealized loss on a CRA-eligible mortgage-backed security is other-than-temporary, a calculation of the security’s present value is made using current pool data, the current delinquency pipeline, default rates and loan loss severities based on the historical performance of the mortgage pools, and Northern Trust’s outlook for the housing market and the overall economy. If the present value of the collateral pools were found to be less than the current amortized cost of the security, a credit-related OTTI loss would be recorded in earnings equal to the difference between the two amounts.

Impairments of CRA-eligible mortgage-backed securities are influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to, U.S. economic and housing market performance, pool credit enhancement level, year of origination, and estimated credit quality of the collateral. The factors used in estimating losses related to CRA-eligible mortgage-backed securities vary by year of loan origination and collateral quality.

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until the repurchase.

Credit Quality Indicators.

Credit quality indicators are statistics, measurements or other metrics that provide information regarding the relative credit risk of loans and leases. Northern Trust utilizes a variety of credit quality indicators to assess the credit risk of loans and leases at the segment, class, and individual credit exposure levels.

As part of its credit process, Northern Trust utilizes an internal borrower risk rating system to support identification, approval, and monitoring of credit risk. Borrower risk ratings are used in credit underwriting and management reporting.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Risk ratings are used for ranking the credit risk of borrowers and the probability of their default. Each borrower is rated using one of a number of ratings models, which consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. The ratings models vary among classes of loans and leases in order to capture the unique risk characteristics inherent within each particular type of credit exposure. Provided below are the more significant performance indicator attributes considered within Northern Trust’s borrower rating models, by loan and lease class.

•

Commercial and Institutional: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, asset size and capital levels;

•

Commercial Real Estate: debt service coverage, loan-to-value ratio, leasing status and guarantor support;

•

Lease Financing and Commercial-Other: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, asset size and capital levels;

•

Non-U.S.: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, return on assets and capital levels;

•

Residential Real Estate: payment history, credit bureau scores and loan-to-value ratio;

•

Private Client: cash flow-to-debt and net worth ratios, leverage and liquidity; and

•

Personal-Other: cash flow-to-debt and net worth ratios.

While the criteria vary by model, the objective is for the borrower ratings to be consistent in both the measurement and ranking of risk. Each model is calibrated to a master rating scale to support this consistency. Ratings for borrowers not in default range from “1” for the strongest credits to “7” for the weakest non-defaulted credits. Ratings of “8” or “9” are used for defaulted borrowers. Borrower risk ratings are monitored and are revised when events or circumstances indicate a change is required. Risk ratings are generally validate

d at least annually.

Loan and lease segment and class balances at

December 31, 2019

and


are provided below, segregated by borrower ratings into “1 to 3”, “4 to 5”, and “6 to 9” (watch l

ist), categories.

TABLE 79: BORROWER RATINGS

Loans and leases in the “1 to 3” category are expected to exhibit minimal to modest probabilities of default and are characterized by borrowers having the strongest financial qualities, including above average financial flexibility, cash flows and capital levels. Borrowers assigned these ratings are anticipated to experience very little to moderate financial pressure in adverse down cycle scenarios. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers within this category exhibit a minimal to modest likelihood of loss.

Loans and leases in the “4 to 5” category are expected to exhibit moderate to acceptable probabilities of default and are characterized by borrowers with less financial flexibility than those in the “1 to 3” category. Cash flows and capital levels are generally sufficient to allow for borrowers to meet current requirements, but have fewer financial resources to manage through economic downturns. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers within this category exhibit a moderate likelihood of loss.

Loans and leases in the watch list category have elevated credit risk profiles that are monitored through internal watch lists, and consist of credits with borrower ratings of “6 to 9”. These credits, which include all nonperforming credits, are expected to exhibit minimally acceptable probabilities of default, elevated risk of default, or are currently in default. Borrowers associated with these risk profiles that are not currently in default have limited financial flexibility. Cash flows and capital

levels range from acceptable to potentially insufficient to meet current requirements, particularly in adverse down cycle scenarios. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers in this category exhibit an elevated to probable

likelihood of loss.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses, which represents management’s estimate of probable losses related to specific borrower relationships and inherent in the various loan and lease portfolios, undrawn commitments, and standby letters of credit, is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process. Northern Trust’s accounting policies related to the estimation of the allowance for credit losses and the charging off of loans, leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are consistent across both loan and lease segments.

Loans, leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Determinations as to whether an uncollectible loan is charged off or a specific allowance is established are based on management’s assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss.

Changes in the allowance for credit losses by segment were as follows:

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Concentrations of credit risk exist if a number of borrowers or other counterparties are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The fact that a credit exposure falls into one of these groups does not necessarily indicate that the credit has a higher than normal degree of credit risk. These groups are: banks and bank holding companies, residential real estate, and commercial real estate.

Banks and Bank Holding Companies.

At

December 31, 2019

, on-balance-sheet credit risk to banks and bank holding companies, both U.S. and non-U.S., consisted primarily of interest-bearing deposits with banks of

$

, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell of

$

712.8

. Credit risk associated with U.S. and non-U.S. banks and bank holding companies deemed to be counterparties by Credit Risk Management is managed by the Capital Markets Credit Committee. Credit limits are established through a review process that includes an internally-prepared financial analysis, use of an internal risk rating system and consideration of external ratings from rating agencies. Northern Trust places deposits with banks that have strong internal and external credit ratings and the average life to maturity of deposits with banks is maintained on a short-term basis in order to respond quickly to changing credit conditions.

Commercial Real Estate.

The commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended primarily to experienced investors well known to Northern Trust. Underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage requirements. Recourse to borrowers through guarantees is also commonly required. Commercial mortgage financing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of income-producing properties. Cash flows from the properties generally are sufficient to amortize the loan. These loans are primarily located in the

California

,

Illinois

,

Florida

,

Texas

, and

markets. Construction, acquisition and development loans provide financing for commercial real estate prior to rental income stabilization. The intent is generally that the borrower will sell the project or refinance the loan through a commercial mortgage with Northern Trust or another financial institution upon completion.

TABLE 93: GOODWILL

The goodwill impairment test is performed at least annually at the reporting-unit level. The Corporation has determined its reporting units for this purpose to be Corporate & Institutional Services and Wealth Management. Goodwill was tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2019 using a quantitative assessment in which the estimated fair values of the reporting units are compared to their carrying values. Impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Based upon the quantitative assessments, there were no impairments to goodwill in 2019.

Floating Rate Capital Debt

In January 1997, the Corporation issued

$


million

of Floating Rate Capital Securities, Series A, through a statutory business trust wholly owned by the Corporation (NTC Capital I). In April 1997, the Corporation also issued, through a separate wholly owned statutory business trust (NTC Capital II),

$


million

of Floating Rate Capital Securities, Series B. The sole assets of the trusts are subordinated debentures of Northern Trust Corporation that have the same interest rates and maturity dates as the corresponding distribution rates and redemption dates of the Floating Rate Capital Securities. The Series A Securities were issued at a discount to yield

60.5

basis points above the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and are due

January 15, 2027

. The Series B Securities were issued at a discount to yield

67.9

basis points above the three-month LIBOR and are due

April 15, 2027

.

Under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the regulatory capital treatment of these securities is required to be phased out over a period that began on January 1, 2013. In


,


%

of these securities are eligible for Tier 2 capital treatment, declining at an incremental


%

a year until they are fully phased out in 2022.

The Corporation has fully, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed all payments due on the Series A and B securities. The holders of the Series A and B securities are entitled to receive preferential cumulative cash distributions quarterly in arrears (based on the liquidation amount of

$

1,000

per security) at an interest rate equal to the rate on the corresponding


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

subordinated debentures. The interest rate on the Series A and Series B securities is equal to three-month LIBOR plus

0.52

%

and

0.59

%

, respectively. Subject to certain exceptions, the Corporation has the right to defer payment of interest on the subordinated debentures at any time or from time to time for a period not exceeding


consecutive quarterly periods provided that no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity date. If interest is deferred on the subordinated debentures, distributions on the Series A and B securities will also be deferred and the Corporation will not be permitted, subject to certain exceptions, to pay or declare any cash distributions with respect to the Corporation’s capital stock or debt securities that rank the same as or junior to the subordinated debentures, until all past due distributions are paid. The subordinated debentures are unsecured and subordinated to substantially all of the Corporation’s existing indebtedness.

The Corporation has the right to redeem the Series A and Series B subordinated debentures, in whole or in part, at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Revenue from Contracts with Clients

Trust, Investment, and Other Servicing Fees.

Custody and fund administration income is comprised of revenues received from our core asset servicing business for providing custody, fund administration, and middle-office-related services, primarily to C&IS clients. Investment management and advisory income contains revenue received from providing asset management and related services to Wealth Management and C&IS clients and to Northern Trust sponsored funds. Securities lending income represents revenues generated from securities lending arrangements that Northern Trust enters into as agent, mainly with C&IS clients. Other income largely consists of revenues received from providing employee benefit, investment risk and analytic and other services to C&IS and Wealth Management clients.

Other Noninterest Income.

Treasury management income represents revenues received from providing cash and liquidity management services to C&IS and Wealth Management clients. The portion of securities commissions and trading income that relates to revenue from contracts with clients is primarily comprised of commissions earned from providing securities brokerage services to Wealth Management and C&IS clients. The portion of other operating income that relates to revenue from contracts with clients is mainly comprised of service fees for banking-related services provided to Wealth Management and C&IS clients.

Performance Obligations.

Clients are typically charged monthly or quarterly in arrears based on the fee arrangement agreed to with each client; payment terms will vary depending on the client and services offered.

Substantially all revenues generated from contracts with clients for asset servicing, asset management, securities lending, treasury management and banking-related services are recognized on an accrual basis, over the period in which services are provided. The nature of Northern Trust’s performance obligations is to provide a series of distinct services in which the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the promised services as they are performed. Fee arrangements are mainly comprised of variable amounts based on market value of client assets managed and serviced, transaction volumes, number of accounts, and securities lending volume and spreads. Revenue is recognized using the output method in an amount that reflects the consideration to which Northern Trust expects to be entitled in exchange for providing each month or quarter of service. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on the price agreed to with the client, representing its relative standalone selling price.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Security brokerage revenue is primarily represented by securities commissions received in exchange of providing trade execution related services. Control is transferred at a point in time, on the trade date of the transaction, and fees are typically variable based on transaction volumes and security types.

Northern Trust’s contracts with its clients are typically open-ended arrangements and are therefore considered to have an original duration of less than one year. Northern Trust has elected the practical expedient to not disclose the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.

The following table presents revenues disaggregated by major revenue source.

TABLE 103: REVENUE DISAGGREGATION

Trust, investment and other servicing fees and treasury management fees represent revenue from contracts with clients. For the year ended

Income Taxes

The following table reconciles the total provision for income taxes recorded in the consolidated statements of income with the amounts computed at the statutory federal tax rate for the periods presented below.

TABLE 108: INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense for the twelve months ended

December 31, 2019

and


was

$

451.9

million

and

$

401.4

million

, representing an effective tax rate of

23.2

%

and

20.5

%

, respectively. For the twelve months ended

December 31, 2019

, the provision for income taxes included an increase in the U.S. taxes payable on the income of the Corporation’s non-U.S. branches. This increase included a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as management believes the foreign tax credit carryforward generated in


will not be fully realized.

For the twelve months ended

December 31, 2018

, the provision for income taxes included income tax benefits recorded in 2018 associated with the timing of tax deductions for software development-related expenses and the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by a change in the earnings mix in tax jurisdictions in which the Corporation operates.

Additionally, the 2017 provision for income taxes included a net benefit attributable to the implementation of the TCJA of

$

53.1

million

and Federal and State research tax credits of

$

17.6

million

related to the Corporation’s technology spend between 2013 and 2016, each resulting in a reduction of the effective tax rate.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The TCJA was enacted on December 22, 2017, and reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from

35%

to

21%

.

It also required companies to pay a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. At December 31, 2017, Northern Trust made a reasonable estimate as to the impact of the TCJA. During 2018, Northern Trust completed the related calculations and additional analyses associated with the implementation of the TCJA, resulting in a number of adjustments to the 2018 tax provision as follows:

TABLE 109: IMPACT OF TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT

Adjustments in the above table included a 2018 tax benefit of

$

16.8

million

resulting from an adjustment to the Corporation’s 2017 income tax provision for mandatory deemed repatriation with respect to the pre-2018 earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, offset by a

$

12.7

million

net provision recorded in 2018 associated with the repricing of deferred taxes.

For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the TCJA introduces new provisions for U.S. taxation of certain Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). Northern Trust has made the policy election to record any current year tax expense associated with GILTI in the period in which it is incurred.

The Corporation files income tax returns in the U.S. federal, various state, and foreign jurisdictions. The Corporation is no longer subject to income tax examinations by U.S. federal authorities before 2013, U.S. state or local tax authorities for years before 2011, or non-U.S. tax authorities for years before 2012.

Included in Other Liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets at

December 31, 2019

and


were

$

25.3

million

and

$

21.9

million

of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively. If recognized,


and


net income would have increased by

$

22.7

million

and

$

19.8

million

, respectively, resulting in a decrease of those years’ effective income tax rates.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

TABLE 110: UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

Unrecognized tax benefits had net increases of

$

3.4

million

, resulting in a remaining balance of

$

25.3

million

at

December 31, 2019

, compared to net decreases of

$

5.8

million

resulting in a remaining balance of

$

21.9

million

at

December 31, 2018

. It is possible that changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could occur in the next 12 months due to changes in judgment related to recognition or measurement, settlements with taxing authorities, or expiration of statute of limitations. Management does not believe that future changes, if any, would have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of Northern Trust, although they could have a material effect on operating results for a particular period.

A benefit for interest and penalties of

$

1.3

million

, net of tax, was included in the provision for income taxes for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. This compares to a provision for interest and penalties of

$

0.3

million

, net of tax, and

$

0.1

million

, net of tax, for the year ended

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the liability for the potential payment of interest and penalties totaled

$

8.4

million

and

$

9.2

million

, net of tax, respectively.

Employee Benefits

The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries provide various benefit programs, including defined benefit pension, postretirement health care, and defined contribution plans. A description of each major plan and related disclosures are provided below.

Pension.

A noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covers substantially all U.S. employees of Northern Trust. Employees of certain European subsidiaries retain benefits in local defined benefit plans, although those plans are closed to new participants and to future benefit accruals. Employees continue to accrue benefits under the Swiss pension plan, which is accounted for as a defined benefit plan under U.S. GAAP.

Northern Trust also maintains a noncontributory supplemental pension plan for participants whose retirement benefits under the U.S. Qualified Plan are expected to exceed the limits imposed by federal tax law. Northern Trust has a nonqualified trust, referred to as a “Rabbi” Trust, used to hold assets designated for the funding of benefits in excess of those permitted in certain of its qualified retirement plans. This arrangement offers participants a degree of assurance for payment of benefits in excess of those permitted in the related qualified plans. As the “Rabbi” Trust assets remain subject to the claims of creditors and are not the property of the employees, they are accounted for as corporate assets and are included in Other Assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Total assets in the “Rabbi” Trust related to the nonqualified pension plan at

During 2017, the investment strategy employed for Northern Trust's U.S. Qualified Plan was changed to utilize a dynamic glide path based on a set of pre-approved asset allocations to return-seeking and liability-hedging assets that vary in accordance with the U.S. Qualified Plan's projected benefit obligation funded ratio. In general, as the U.S. Qualified Plan’s projected benefit obligation funded ratio increases beyond an established threshold, the U.S. Qualified Plan’s allocation to liability-hedging assets will increase while the allocation to return-seeking assets will decrease. Conversely, a decrease in the U.S. Qualified Plan’s projected benefit obligation funded ratio beyond an established threshold will result in a decrease in the U.S. Qualified Plan’s allocation to liability-hedging assets and increase in the allocation to return-seeking assets. Liability-hedging assets include U.S. long credit bonds, U.S. long government bonds, and a custom completion strategy used to hedge more closely the liability duration of projected plan benefits with bond duration across all durations. Return-seeking assets include: U.S. equity, international developed equity, emerging markets equity, real estate, high yield bonds, global listed infrastructure, emerging market debt, private equity and hedge funds.

Northern Trust utilizes an asset/liability methodology to determine the investment policies that will best meet its short and long-term objectives. The process is performed by modeling current and alternative strategies for asset allocation, funding policy and actuarial methods and assumptions. The financial modeling uses projections of expected capital market returns and expected volatility of those returns to determine alternative asset mixes having the greatest probability of meeting the U.S. Qualified Plan’s investment objectives. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of the U.S. Qualified Plan liabilities, funded status, and corporate financial condition. The intent of this strategy is to protect the U.S. Qualified Plan's healthy funded status and generate returns, which in combination with minimal voluntary contributions are expected to outpace the U.S. Qualified Plan's liability growth over the long run.

The target allocation of the U.S. Qualified Plan assets since February 2019 is


%

U.S. long credit bonds,


%

U.S. long government bonds,


%

custom completion,


%

U.S. equities,


%

international developed equity,


%

emerging markets equity,


%

private real estate,


%

high yield bonds,


%

global listed infrastructure,


%

emerging market debt,


%

private equity, and


%

hedge funds.

Equity investments include common stocks that are listed on an exchange and investments in commingled funds that invest primarily in publicly traded equities. Equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks and divided by investment style and market capitalization. Fixed income securities held include U.S. treasury securities and investments in commingled funds that invest in a diversified blend of longer duration fixed income securities; the custom completion strategy uses U.S. treasury securities and interest rate futures (or similar instruments) to align more closely with the target hedge ratio across maturities. Diversifying investments, including private equity, hedge funds, private real estate, emerging market debt, high yield bonds, and global listed infrastructure, are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Private equity assets consist primarily of investments in limited partnerships that invest in individual companies in the form of non-public equity or non-public debt positions. Direct or co-investment in non-public stock by the U.S. Qualified Plan is prohibited. The U.S. Qualified Plan’s private equity investments are limited to


%

of the total limited partnership and the maximum allowable loss cannot exceed the commitment amount. The U.S. Qualified Plan invests in

one

hedge fund of funds, which invests, either directly or indirectly, in diversified portfolios of funds or other pooled investment vehicles.

Investments in private real estate, high yield bonds, emerging market debt, and global listed infrastructure are designed to provide income and added diversification.

Though not a primary strategy for meeting the U.S. Qualified Plan’s objectives, derivatives may be used from time to time, depending on the nature of the asset class to which they relate, to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner,

Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through monthly liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews. Standards used to evaluate the U.S. Qualified Plan’s investment manager performance include, but are not limited to, the achievement of objectives, operation within guidelines and policy, and comparison against a relative benchmark. In addition, each manager of the investment funds held by the U.S. Qualified Plan is ranked against a universe of peers and compared to a relative benchmark. Total U.S. Qualified Plan performance analysis includes an analysis of the market environment, asset allocation impact on performance, risk and return relative to other ERISA plans, and manager impacts upon U.S. Qualified Plan performance.

The following describes the hierarchy of inputs used to measure fair value and the primary valuation methodologies used by Northern Trust for the U.S. Qualified Plan assets measured at fair value.

Level 1 – Quoted, active market prices for identical assets or liabilities.

The U.S. Qualified Plan’s Level 1 investments are comprised of a mutual fund and domestic common stocks. The U.S. Qualified Plan’s Level 1 investments that are exchange traded are valued at the closing price reported by the respective exchanges on the day of valuation.

Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted active market prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.

The U.S. Qualified Plan’s Level 2 assets are comprised of U.S. government obligations and collective trust funds. The investments in collective trust funds fair values are calculated on a scheduled basis using the closing market prices and accruals of securities in the funds (total value of the funds) divided by the number of fund shares currently issued and outstanding. Redemptions of the collective trust funds occur by contract at the respective fund’s redemption date NAV.

Level 3 – Valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace.

The U.S. Qualified Plan’s Level 3 assets are comprised of private equity and hedge funds, which invest in underlying groups of investment funds or other pooled investment vehicles that are selected by the respective funds’ investment managers. The investment funds and the underlying investments held by these investment funds are valued at fair value. In determining the fair value of the underlying investments of each fund, the fund’s investment manager or general partner takes into account the estimated value reported by the underlying funds as well as any other considerations that may, in their judgment, increase or decrease such estimated value.

The U.S. Qualified Plan’s Level 3 assets are also comprised of real estate funds, which invest in real estate assets. The investment in properties by the real estate funds are carried at fair value, which is estimated based on the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date. The valuation plan for each real estate investment is subject to review on an annual basis which is based on either an external appraisal from appraisal firms or internal valuations prepared by the real estate fund's investment advisor.

While Northern Trust believes its valuation methods for U.S. Qualified Plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to Level 3 assets, could have a material effect on the computation of the estimated fair values.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A building block approach is employed for Northern Trust’s U.S. Qualified Plan in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets and long-term historical relationships between equities, fixed income and other asset classes are studied using the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long-run. Current market factors such as inflation expectations and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio rate of return is established with consideration given to diversification and rebalancing. The rate is reviewed against peer data and historical returns to verify the return is reasonable and appropriate. Based on this approach and the U.S. Qualified Plan’s target asset allocation, the expected long-term rate of return on assets as of the U.S. Qualified Plan’s

December 31, 2019

measurement date was set at

5.25

%

Postretirement Health Care.

Northern Trust maintains an unfunded postretirement health care plan under which those employees who retire at age


or older under the provisions of the U.S. defined benefit plan and had attained


years

of service as of December 31, 2011 may be eligible for subsidized postretirement health care coverage. The provisions of this health care plan may be changed further at the discretion of Northern Trust, which also reserves the right to terminate these benefits at any time.

The Northern Trust Corporation 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2017 Plan) is administered by the Compensation and Benefits Committee (Committee) of the Board of Directors. All employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and all directors of the Corporation are eligible to receive awards under the 2017 Plan. The 2017 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options; tandem and free-standing stock appreciation rights; stock awards in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock awards; and performance awards.

Beginning with grants made on February 21, 2017 under the Northern Trust Corporation 2012 Stock Plan (2012 Plan), restricted stock unit and performance stock unit grants continue to vest in accordance with the original terms of the award if the applicable employee retires after satisfying applicable age and service requirements. For all applicable periods, stock option grants continue to vest in accordance with the original terms of the award if the employee meets applicable age and service requirements upon separation from service.

Grants are outstanding under the 2017 Plan, the 2012 Plan, and the Amended and Restated Northern Trust Corporation 2002 Stock Plan (2002 Plan). The 2017 Plan was approved by stockholders in April 2017. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan, no additional shares have been or will be granted under the 2012 Plan or 2002 Plan. The total number of shares of the Corporation’s common stock authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan is

20,000,000

plus shares forfeited under the 2012 Plan and 2002 Plan. As of

December 31, 2019

are as follows:

TABLE 128: WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR OPTIONS GRANTED

The expected term of options represents the period of time options granted are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the historical exercise behavior attributable to previous option grants. Dividend yield represents the estimated yield from dividends paid on the Corporation’s common stock over the expected term of the options. Expected volatility is determined based on a combination of the historical volatility of Northern Trust’s stock price and the implied volatility of traded options on Northern Trust stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for a period equal to the expected term of the options granted.

Note 26 –

Contingent Liabilities

Legal Proceedings.

In the normal course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to pending and threatened legal actions, and are subject to regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings, both formal and informal. In certain legal actions, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted. In regulatory matters, claims for disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other remedial actions or sanctions may be sought.

Based on current knowledge, after consultation with legal counsel and after taking into account current accruals, management does not believe that losses, fines or penalties, if any, arising from pending litigation or threatened legal actions or regulatory matters either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation, although such matters could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operating results for a particular period.

Under GAAP, (i) an event is “probable” if the “future event or events are likely to occur”; (ii) an event is “reasonably possible” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely”; and (iii) an event is “remote” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.”

The outcome of litigation and regulatory matters is inherently difficult to predict and/or the range of loss often cannot be reasonably estimated, particularly for matters that (i) will be decided by a jury, (ii) are in early stages, (iii) involve uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iv) are subject to appeals or motions, (v) involve significant factual issues to be resolved, including with respect to the amount of damages, (vi) do not specify the amount of damages sought or (vii) seek very large damages based on novel and complex damage and liability legal theories. Accordingly, the Corporation cannot reasonably estimate the eventual outcome of these pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties, if any, related to each pending matter will be.

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation records accruals for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. When loss contingencies are not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Corporation does not record accruals.

No

material accruals have been recorded for pending litigation or threatened legal actions or regulatory matters.

For a limited number of matters for which a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss. As of

December 31, 2019

, the Corporation has estimated the range of reasonably possible loss for these matters to be from

zero

to approximately

$


million

in the aggregate. The Corporation’s estimate with respect to the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate.

In certain other pending matters, there may be a range of reasonably possible loss (including reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued) that cannot be reasonably estimated for the reasons described above. Such matters are not included in the estimated range of reasonably possible loss discussed above.

In 2015, Northern Trust Fiduciary Services (Guernsey) Limited (NTFS), an indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, was charged by a French investigating magistrate judge with complicity in estate tax fraud in connection with the administration of

two

trusts for which it serves as trustee. Charges also were brought against a number of other persons and entities related to this matter. In 2017, a French court found no estate tax fraud had occurred and NTFS and all other persons and entities charged were acquitted. The Public Prosecutor’s Office of France appealed the court decision and in June 2018 a French appellate court issued its opinion on the matter, acquitting all persons and entities charged, including NTFS. The Public Prosecutor’s Office of France has appealed the appellate court’s decision to the Cour de Cassation, the highest court in France. As trustee, NTFS provided no tax advice and had no involvement in the preparation or filing of the challenged estate tax filings.

Visa Class B Common Shares.

Northern Trust, as a member of Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A.) and in connection with the 2007 restructuring of Visa U.S.A. and its affiliates and the 2008 initial public offering of Visa Inc. (Visa), received certain Visa Class B common shares. The Visa Class B common shares are subject to certain selling restrictions until the final resolution of certain litigation related to interchange fees involving Visa (the covered litigation), at which time the shares are convertible into Visa Class A common shares based on a conversion rate dependent upon the ultimate cost of resolving the covered litigation. On June 28, 2018, and September 27, 2019, Visa deposited an additional

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, into an escrow account previously established with respect to the covered litigation. As a result of the additional contributions to the escrow account, the rate at which Visa Class B common shares will convert into Visa Class A common shares was reduced.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In September 2018, Visa reached a proposed class settlement agreement covering damage claims but not injunctive relief claims regarding the covered litigation. In December 2019, the district court granted final approval for the proposed class settlement agreement. Certain merchants have opted out of the class settlement and are pursuing claims separately, while other merchants have appealed the approval order granted by the district court. The ultimate resolution of the covered litigation, the timing for removal of the selling restrictions on the Visa Class B common shares and the rate at which such shares will ultimately convert into Visa Class A common shares are uncertain.

In June 2016 and 2015, Northern Trust recorded a

$

123.1

million

and

$

99.9

million

net gain on the sale of

1.1

million

and

1.0

million

of its Visa Class B common shares, respectively. These sales do not affect Northern Trust’s risk related to the impact of the covered litigation on the rate at which such shares will ultimately convert into Visa Class A common shares. Northern Trust continued to hold approximately

4.1

Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at their original cost basis of

Clearing and Settlement Organizations.

The Bank is a participating member of various cash, securities, and foreign exchange clearing and settlement organizations. It participates in these organizations on behalf of its clients and on its own behalf as a result of its own activities. A wide variety of cash and securities transactions are settled through these organizations, including those involving obligations of states and political subdivisions, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, dollar placements, and securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association.

As a result of its participation in cash, securities, and foreign exchange clearing and settlement organizations, the Bank could be responsible for a pro rata share of certain credit-related losses arising out of the clearing activities. The method in which such losses would be shared by the clearing members is stipulated in each clearing organization’s membership agreement. Credit exposure related to these agreements varies from day to day, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the volume of transactions cleared through the organizations. At

Note 27 –

Derivative Financial Instruments

Northern Trust is a party to various derivative financial instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients, as part of its trading activity for its own account; and as part of its risk management activities. These instruments may include foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts, total return swap contracts, and swaps related to the sale of certain Visa Class B common shares. Please refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for the significant accounting policies for derivative financial instruments.

Foreign exchange contracts

are agreements to exchange specific amounts of currencies at a future date, at a specified rate of exchange. Foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to meet the foreign exchange needs of clients. Foreign exchange contracts are also used for trading and risk management purposes. For risk management purposes, Northern Trust uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates relating to certain forecasted non-functional currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions, foreign-currency- denominated assets and liabilities, including debt securities and net investments in non-U.S. affiliates.

Interest rate contracts

include swap and option contracts. Interest rate swap contracts involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Northern Trust enters into interest rate swap contracts with its clients and also may utilize such contracts to reduce or eliminate the exposure to changes in the cash flows or fair value of hedged assets or liabilities due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate option contracts may include caps, floors, collars and swaptions, and provide for the transfer or reduction of interest rate risk, typically in exchange for a fee. Northern Trust enters into option contracts as a seller of interest rate protection to clients. Northern Trust receives a fee at the outset of the agreement for the assumption of the risk of an unfavorable change in interest rates. This assumed interest rate risk is then mitigated by entering into an offsetting position with an outside counterparty. Northern Trust may also purchase or enter into option contracts for risk management purposes including to reduce the exposure to changes in the cash flows of hedged assets due to changes in interest rates.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following table shows the notional and fair values of all derivative financial instruments as of

TABLE 134: NOTIONAL AND FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

(1) Derivative assets are reported in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

(2) Derivative liabilities are reported in Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

(3) This line includes swaps related to sales of certain Visa Class B common shares and total return swap contracts.

(4) See further detail in Note 28, "Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities."

Notional amounts of derivative financial instruments do not represent credit risk, and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. They are used merely to express the volume of this activity. Northern Trust’s credit-related risk of loss is limited to the positive fair value of the derivative instrument, net of any collateral received, which is significantly less than the notional amount.

Hedging Derivative Instruments Designated under GAAP.

Northern Trust uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate, and equity price. Certain hedging relationships are formally designated and qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Other derivatives that are entered into for risk management purposes as economic hedges are not formally designated as hedges and changes in fair value are recognized currently in other operating income (see below section “Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedging under GAAP”).

Fair Value Hedges.

Derivatives are designated as fair value hedges to limit Northern Trust’s exposure to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to movements in interest rates.

Cash Flow Hedges.

Derivatives are also d

esignated as cash flow hedges in order to minimize the variability in cash flows of earning assets or forecasted transactions caused by movements in interest or foreign exchange rates.

Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedging under GAAP.

Northern Trust’s derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging under GAAP include derivatives for purposes of client-related and trading activities, as well as other risk management purposes. These activities consist principally of providing foreign exchange services to clients in connection with Northern Trust’s global custody business. However, in the normal course of business, Northern Trust also engages in trading of currencies for its own account.

Non-designated risk management derivatives include foreign exchange contracts entered into to manage the foreign currency risk of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, the net investment in certain non-U.S. affiliates, commercial loans, and forecasted foreign-currency-denominated transactions. Swaps related to sales of certain Visa Class B common shares were entered into pursuant to which Northern Trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares. Total return swaps are entered into to manage the equity price risk associated with certain investments.

Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges under GAAP are recognized currently in income.

(3) Northern Trust did not place any cash collateral with counterparties that was not offset in the consolidated balance sheets that could have been used to offset the net amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets as of

and


.

All of Northern Trust’s securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) involve the transfer of financial assets in exchange for cash subject to a right and obligation to repurchase those assets for an agreed upon amount. In the event of a repurchase failure, the cash or financial assets are available for offset. All of Northern Trust’s repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are subject to a master netting arrangement, which sets forth the rights and obligations for repurchase and offset. Under the master netting arrangement, Northern Trust is entitled to set off receivables from and collateral placed with a single counterparty against obligations owed to that counterparty. In addition, collateral held by Northern Trust can be offset against receivables from that counterparty. However, Northern Trust’s repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements do not meet the requirements to net under GAAP.

Derivative asset and liability positions with a single counterparty can be offset against each other in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist. Derivative assets and liabilities can be further offset by cash collateral received from, and deposited with, the transacting counterparty. The basis for this view is that, upon termination of transactions subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement, the individual derivative receivables do not


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

represent resources to which general creditors have rights and individual derivative payables do not represent claims that are equivalent to the claims of general creditors.

Credit risk associated with derivative instruments relates to the failure of the counterparty and the failure of Northern Trust to pay based on the contractual terms of the agreement, and is generally limited to the unrealized fair value gains and losses on these instruments, net of any collateral received or deposited. The amount of credit risk will increase or decrease during the lives of the instruments as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or equity prices fluctuate. Northern Trust’s risk is controlled by limiting such activity to an approved list of counterparties and by subjecting such activity to the same credit and quality controls as are followed in lending and investment activities. Credit Support Annexes and other similar agreements are currently in place with a number of Northern Trust’s counterparties which mitigate the aforementioned credit risk associated with derivative activity conducted with those counterparties by requiring that significant net unrealized fair value gains be supported by collateral placed with Northern Trust.

Additional cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties totaling

$

196.3

million

and

$

2.0

million

, respectively, as of

December 31, 2019

, and

$

and

$

91.5

million

, respectively, as of

December 31, 2018

, was not offset against derivative assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as the amounts exceeded the net derivative positions with those counterparties.

Certain master netting arrangements Northern Trust enters into with derivative counterparties contain credit risk-related contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare Northern Trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event Northern Trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was

$

million

and

at

December 31, 2019

and


of

Note 29 –

Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments, Guarantees and Other Commitments

Northern Trust, in the normal course of business, enters into various types of commitments and issues letters of credit to meet the liquidity and credit enhancement needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these instruments represent the potential credit exposure should the instrument be fully drawn upon and the client default. To control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit, Northern Trust subjects such activities to the same credit quality and monitoring controls as its lending activities. Commitments and letters of credit consist of the following:

Legally Binding Commitments to Extend Credit

generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since a significant portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements.

Standby Letters of Credit

obligate Northern Trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the clients are unable to do so. These instruments are primarily issued to support public and private financial commitments, including commercial paper, bond financing, initial margin requirements on futures exchanges, and similar transactions. Northern Trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements and in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants.

Financial Guarantees

are issued by Northern Trust to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party under certain arrangements.

Commercial Letters of Credit

are instruments issued by Northern Trust on behalf of its clients that authorize a third party (the beneficiary) to draw drafts up to a stipulated amount under the specified terms and conditions of the agreement and other similar instruments. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily to facilitate international trade.

Custody Securities Lent with Indemnification

involves Northern Trust lending securities owned by clients to borrowers who are reviewed and approved by the Northern Trust Capital Markets Credit Committee, as part of its securities custody activities and at the direction of its clients. In connection with these activities, Northern Trust has issued indemnifications to certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrower’s failure to return securities when due, should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral required to be posted. Borrowers are required to collateralize fully securities received with cash or marketable securities. As securities are loaned, collateral is maintained at a minimum


%

of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest. The collateral is revalued on a daily basis. The amount of securities loaned as of

December 31, 2019

and


subject to indemnification was

$

138.1

billion

and

$

128.9

billion

, respectively. Because of the credit quality of the borrowers and the requirement to fully collateralize securities borrowed, management

Note 30 –

Variable Interest Entities

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) are defined within GAAP as entities which either have a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Investors that finance a VIE through debt or equity interests, or other counterparties that provide other forms of support, such as guarantees, subordinated fee arrangements, or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder, if any, that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the VIE’s primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.

Leveraged Leases.

In leveraged leasing transactions, Northern Trust acts as lessor of the underlying asset subject to the lease and typically funds


-


%

of the asset’s cost via an equity ownership in a trust with the remaining


-


%

provided by third party non-recourse debt holders. In such transactions, the trusts, which are VIEs, are created to provide the lessee use of the property with substantially all of the rights and obligations of ownership. The lessee’s maintenance and operation of the leased property has a direct effect on the fair value of the underlying property, and the lessee also has the ability to increase the benefits it can receive and limit the losses it can suffer by the manner in which it uses the property. As a result, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the leveraged lease trust VIEs given it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the leveraged lease trust VIEs.

Northern Trust’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with leveraged lease trust VIEs is limited to the carrying amounts of its leveraged lease investments. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in loans and leases in the consolidated balance sheets, were

$

42.6

million

and

$

56.8

million

, respectively. Northern Trust’s funding requirements relative to the leveraged lease trust VIEs are limited to its invested capital. Northern Trust has

no

other liquidity arrangements or obligations to purchase assets of the leveraged lease trust VIEs that would expose Northern Trust to a loss.

Tax Credit Structures.

Northern Trust invests in qualified affordable housing projects and community development entities (collectively, community development projects) that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits. The community development projects are formed as limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which Northern Trust invests as a limited partner/investor member through equity contributions. The economic performance of the community development projects, some of which are VIEs, is subject to the performance of their underlying investment and their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development project VIEs as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. This power is held by the general partners and managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the community development project VIEs.

Northern Trust’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with community development projects is limited to the carrying amounts of its investments, including any undrawn commitments. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the carrying amounts of these investments in community development projects that generate tax credits, included in Other Assets

Investment Funds.

Northern Trust acts as asset manager for various funds in which clients of Northern Trust are investors. As an asset manager of funds, Northern Trust earns a competitively priced fee that is based on assets managed and varies with each fund’s investment objective. Based on its analysis, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs under GAAP.

Periodically, Northern Trust makes seed capital investments to certain funds. As of

December 31, 2019

, Northern Trust had

$

112.0

million

Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends and Loans or Advances

Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to the Corporation without regulatory approval. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for payment of any dividend by a state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding

two years

. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its “undivided profits,” as defined, without regulatory and stockholder approval.

Under Illinois law, an Illinois state bank, prior to paying a dividend, must carry over to surplus at least one-tenth of its net profits since the date of the declaration of the last preceding dividend, until the bank’s surplus is equal to its capital. In addition, an Illinois state bank may not pay any dividend in an amount greater than its net profits then on hand, after deduction of losses and bad debts (defined as debts due to a state bank on which interest is past due and unpaid for a period of

six months

or more, unless the same are well secured and in the process of collection).

The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the Bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the Bank to become undercapitalized. In addition, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The payment of dividends could, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Basel III impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends (e.g., the Corporation must include proposed dividends in the capital plan that it submits to the Federal Reserve Board and such dividends may only be declared if the Federal Reserve Board does not object to the Corporation’s capital plan).

Under federal law, financial transactions by the Bank, the Corporation’s insured banking subsidiary, with the Corporation and its affiliates that are in the form of loans or extensions of credit, investments, guarantees, derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions or purchases of assets, are restricted. These transactions must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be, offered to non-affiliated companies (i.e. on terms not less favorable to the Bank than market terms). Further, extensions of credit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral and are limited to

10%

of the Bank’s capital and surplus for transactions with a single affiliate and to

20%

of the Bank’s capital and surplus with all affiliates. Other state and federal laws may limit the transfer of funds by the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries to the Corporation and certain of its affiliates.

Note 33 –

Reporting Segments and Related Information

Segment Information.

Northern Trust is organized around its

two

client-focused reporting segments: C&IS and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C&IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to C&IS and Wealth Management.

Reporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets, liabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology. Under the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. Equity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, risk, regulatory considerations, and internal metrics. Allocations of capital and certain corporate


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

expense may not be representative of levels that would be required if the segments were independent entities. The accounting policies used for management reporting are consistent with those described in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." Transfers of income and expense items are recorded at cost; there is no consolidated profit or loss on sales or transfers between reporting segments. Northern Trust's presentations are not necessarily consistent with similar information for other financial institutions.

Effective January 1, 2019, Northern Trust implemented several enhancements to its FTP methodology, including the allocation of contingent liquidity charges to C&IS and Wealth Management client instruments and products. These methodology enhancements affect the results of each reporting segment. Due to the lack of historical information, segment results for periods ended prior to January 1, 2019 have not been revised to reflect the methodology enhancements.

Also effective January 1, 2019, all revenues, expenses and average assets are allocated to C&IS and Wealth Management with the exception of non-recurring activities such as certain costs associated with acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment.

For reporting periods ended prior to January 1, 2019, income and expense associated with the wholesale funding activities and investment portfolios of the Corporation and the Bank, as well as certain corporate-based expense, executive-level compensation and nonrecurring items, were not allocated to C&IS and Wealth Management, and were reported in Treasury and Other.

Reporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made. The results are also subject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies, which are typically reflected on a prospective basis.

Geographic Area Information.

Northern Trust’s non-U.S. activities are primarily related to its asset servicing, asset management, foreign exchange, cash management, and commercial banking businesses. The operations of Northern Trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both U.S and non-U.S. source income and assets. Non-U.S. source income and assets are not separately identified in Northern Trust’s internal management reporting system. However, Northern Trust is required to disclose non-U.S. activities based on the domicile of the customer. Due to the complex and integrated nature of Northern Trust’s activities, it is difficult to segregate with precision revenues, expenses and assets between U.S. and non-U.S.-domiciled customers. Therefore, certain subjective estimates and assumptions have been made to allocate revenues, expenses and assets between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.

For purposes of this disclosure, all foreign exchange trading income has been allocated to non-U.S. operations. Interest expense is allocated to non-U.S. operations based on specifically matched or pooled funding. Allocations of indirect noninterest expenses, when made, are based on various methods such as time, space, and number of employees.

Regulatory Capital Requirements

Northern Trust and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal bank regulatory authorities. Under these requirements, banks must maintain specific risk-based and leverage ratios in order to be classified as “well-capitalized.” The regulatory capital requirements impose certain restrictions upon banks that meet minimum capital requirements but are not “well-capitalized” and obligate the federal bank regulatory authorities to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not maintain such minimum ratios. Such prompt corrective action could have a direct material effect on a bank’s financial statements.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the Bank had capital ratios above the levels required for classification as a “well-capitalized” institution and had not received any regulatory notification of a lower classification. Additionally, Northern Trust’s subsidiary banks located outside the U.S. are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, Northern Trust’s non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements. There were no conditions or events since

December 31, 2019

, that management believes have adversely affected the capital categorization of any Northern Trust subsidiary bank.

The table below provides capital ratios for the Corporation and the Bank determined by Basel III phased in requirements.

TABLE 149: RISK-BASED AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND RATIOS

(1) Effective January 1, 2018, a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of


percent

became applicable.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The risk-based capital guidelines that apply to the Corporation and the Bank, commonly referred to as Basel III, are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the Basel Committee. The Basel III rules are currently being phased in, and will come into full effect by January 1, 2022.

Under the final Basel III rules, the Corporation and the Bank are required to calculate and publicly disclose risk-based capital ratios using two methodologies: an advanced approach and a standardized approach. Under the advanced approach, credit risk weighted assets (RWA) are based on internal credit models and parameters. Additionally, the advanced approach incorporates operational risk RWA. Under the standardized approach, RWA are based on supervisory prescribed risk weights that are primarily dependent on counterparty type and asset class.

Pursuant to the Federal Reserve Board's implementation in the final Basel III rules of a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, the capital adequacy of the Corporation and the Bank is assessed based on the lower of the advanced approach or standardized approach capital ratios.

The U.S.’s implementation of Basel III has increased the minimum capital thresholds for banking organizations and tightened the standards for what qualifies as capital. The Corporation and the Bank believe their capital strength, balance sheets and business models leave them well positioned for the continued U.S. implementation of Basel III.

ACCOUNTING

FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Northern Trust Corporation’s (and subsidiaries’) (the Corporation) internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation as of

December 31, 2019

and


, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended

December 31, 2019

, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated

February 25, 2020

expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
