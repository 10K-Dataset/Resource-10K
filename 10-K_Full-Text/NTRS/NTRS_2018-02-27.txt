In addition to the following information regarding Northern Trust’s business, the reporting segment and geographic area information included in Note 31, “Reporting Segments and Related Information,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.

Business Overview

Northern Trust focuses on managing and servicing client assets through its two client-focused reporting segments: Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C&IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to C&IS and Wealth Management. Northern Trust reports certain income and expense items not allocated to C&IS and Wealth Management in a third reporting segment, Treasury and Other.

CORPORATE & INSTITUTIONAL SERVICES

C&IS is a leading global provider of asset servicing and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors around the globe. Asset servicing and related services encompass a full range of capabilities including, but not limited to: global custody; fund administration; investment operations outsourcing; investment management; investment risk and analytical services; employee benefit services; securities lending; foreign exchange; treasury management; brokerage services; transition management services; banking; and cash management. Client relationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support from locations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region. At

December 31, 2017

, total C&IS assets under custody/administration, assets under custody, and assets under management were

$10.07 trillion

,

$7.44 trillion

, and

$871.2 billion

, respectively.

WEALTH MANAGEMENT

Wealth Management focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. The business also includes the Global Family Office, which provides customized services to meet the complex financial needs of individuals and family offices in the United States and throughout the world with assets typically exceeding $200 million. In supporting these targeted segments, Wealth Management provides trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services; financial consulting; guardianship and estate administration; family business consulting; family financial education; brokerage services; and private and business banking.

Wealth Management is one of the largest providers of advisory services in the United States, with assets under custody/administration, assets under custody, and assets under management of

$655.8 billion

,

$645.5 billion

, and

$289.8 billion

, respectively, at

December 31, 2017

. Wealth Management services are delivered by multidisciplinary teams through a network of offices in 18 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., as well as offices in London, Guernsey, and Abu Dhabi.


ASSET MANAGEMENT

Asset Management, through the Corporation’s various subsidiaries, supports the C&IS and Wealth Management reporting segments by providing a broad range of asset management and related services and other products to clients around the world. Investment solutions are delivered through separately managed accounts, bank common and collective funds, registered investment companies, exchange traded funds, non-U.S. collective investment funds, and unregistered private investment funds. Asset Management’s capabilities include active, passive, and engineered equity; active and passive fixed income; cash management; alternative asset classes (such as private equity and hedge funds of funds); and multi-manager advisory services and products.

December 31, 2017

, including

$871.2 billion

for C&IS clients and

$289.8 billion

for Wealth Management clients.

Competition

Northern Trust faces intense competition in all aspects and areas of its business. Competition is provided by both regulated and unregulated financial services organizations, whose products and services span the local, national, and global markets in which Northern Trust conducts operations. Our competitors include a broad range of financial institutions and service companies, including other custodial banks, deposit-taking institutions, asset management firms, benefits consultants, trust companies, investment banking firms, insurance companies, investment counseling firms, and various financial technology companies, including software providers and data services firms. As our businesses grow and markets evolve, we may encounter increasing and new forms of competition around the world.

Northern Trust’s principal business strategy is to provide quality financial services to targeted market segments in which it believes it has a competitive advantage and favorable growth prospects. As part of this strategy, Northern Trust seeks to deliver a level of service that distinguishes it from its competitors. In addition, Northern Trust emphasizes the development and growth of recurring sources of fee-based income. Northern Trust seeks to develop and expand its recurring fee-based revenue by identifying select markets with attractive growth characteristics and providing a high level of individualized service to clients in those markets. Northern Trust also seeks to preserve its asset quality through established credit review procedures and to maintain a conservative balance sheet.

Economic Conditions And Government Policies

The earnings of Northern Trust are affected by numerous external influences. Chief among these are general economic conditions, both domestic and international, and actions that governments and their central banks take in managing their economies. These general conditions affect all of Northern Trust’s businesses, as well as the quality, value, and profitability of their loan and investment portfolios.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) implements monetary policy through its open market operations in United States Government securities, its setting of the discount rate at which member banks may borrow from Federal Reserve Banks, and its changes in the reserve requirements for deposits. The policies adopted by the Federal Reserve Board directly affect interest rates and therefore what banks earn on their loans and investments and what they pay on their savings and time deposits and other purchased funds.

Supervision And Regulation

Northern Trust is subject to extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the United States, as well as the applicable laws of each of the various jurisdictions outside the United States in which Northern Trust does business. The discussion below outlines significant elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to Northern Trust. Changes in these laws or regulations, or their application, cannot be predicted, but may have a material effect on Northern Trust’s businesses and results of operations.

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION

Under U.S. law, the Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHCA). Consequently, the Corporation and its business activities throughout the world are subject to the supervision, examination, and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. The BHCA and other federal laws subject bank and financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements, including enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Supervision and regulation of bank holding companies, financial holding companies, and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other clients of banking subsidiaries, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of stockholders or other nondepository creditors.


Under the BHCA, bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking. As a financial holding company, the Corporation is permitted to engage in other activities that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, or to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities. Activities defined to be financial in nature include: providing financial or investment advice; securities underwriting and dealing; insurance underwriting; and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies, subject to significant limitations. They also include activities previously determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The Corporation may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

In order to maintain the Corporation’s status as a financial holding company, the Bank, as the Corporation’s sole insured depository institution subsidiary, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” under applicable regulations, and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). In addition, as a result of the amendment of the BHCA by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), as discussed further below, the Corporation must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met, that the Corporation could not undertake new activities, continue certain activities, or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies.

SUBSIDIARY REGULATION

The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, its eligible deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum authorized limit, and it is subject to regulation by both these agencies. As an Illinois banking corporation, the Bank is also subject to Illinois state laws and regulations and to examination and supervision by the Division of Banking of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. The Bank is also registered as a transfer agent with the Federal Reserve Board and is therefore subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board in this area.

The Bank is registered provisionally as a swap dealer with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under the Commodity Exchange Act and is a member of the National Futures Association (NFA). As a provisionally registered swap dealer, the Bank is subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding swap activity and the supervision, examination and enforcement power of the CFTC, NFA, and other regulators. Certain of the Corporation’s other affiliates are registered with the CFTC as commodity trading advisors or commodity pool operators under the Commodity Exchange Act, are members of the NFA, and are subject to that act and the associated rules and regulations of the CFTC and NFA.

The Corporation’s nonbanking affiliates are all subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Its broker-dealer subsidiary is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a broker-dealer and an investment adviser and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, subject to the rules and regulations of both of these bodies. The Corporation’s broker-dealer subsidiary also is registered with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board as a municipal securities dealer. Several subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and are subject to that act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Those subsidiaries also act as investment advisers to various mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and hedge funds of funds that are subject to regulation by the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Other subsidiaries are regulated by state regulators in various states.

FUNCTIONAL REGULATION

Federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on functional regulation, meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity. Banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators, insurance by state insurance regulators, derivatives and swaps activities by the CFTC, and securities activities by the SEC and state securities regulators.

A significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and SEC oversight of some bank securities activities. Generally, banks may conduct securities activities without broker-dealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activity-based exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities. Securities activities outside these exemptions, as a practical matter, need to be conducted by a registered broker-dealer affiliate. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as an investment adviser to a registered investment company.


Another component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal commodity and derivatives laws and CFTC oversight of some bank commodity and derivatives activities, including swap-dealing activities.

THE DODD-FRANK ACT

The Dodd-Frank Act has had a broad impact on the financial services industry, imposing significant new regulatory and compliance requirements, including the imposition of increased capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements, and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness within, the financial services sector. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the U.S. financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Federal Reserve Board, and the FDIC. In February 2017, an executive order was issued by the current Presidential administration (i) establishing core principles for regulating the U.S. financial system and (ii) instructing the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to consult with heads of the member agencies of the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council and issue reports that identify laws, regulations and policies, including those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act, that inhibit federal regulation of the U.S. financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles. Certain of these required reports were issued during 2017, and additional such reports may be issued in the future. The Corporation cannot predict what changes may occur to the Dodd-Frank Act as a result of the executive order and related reports or the ultimate effect such changes would have on the Corporation. The following items provide a brief description of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that currently are the most relevant to the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including the Bank.

Enhanced Prudential Standards.

The Dodd-Frank Act imposed enhanced prudential requirements on U.S. bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, including the Corporation. The enhanced prudential standards include more stringent risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements and single counterparty credit limits for large bank holding companies, including the Corporation. The Federal Reserve Board also has the discretion to require these large U.S. bank holding companies to limit their short-term debt, to issue contingent capital instruments, and to provide enhanced public disclosures. The Federal Reserve Board has issued final rules implementing enhanced prudential standards for more stringent risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements. Under the final rules, the Corporation must submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve Board, be subject to supervisor-conducted periodic stress tests to evaluate capital adequacy in adverse economic conditions, conduct capital stress tests, implement enhanced risk management procedures, comply with a liquidity risk management framework (discussed below in “Liquidity Standards”), conduct liquidity stress tests, and hold a buffer of liquid assets estimated to meet funding needs during a financial stress event. The Federal Reserve Board also has proposed rules that would implement aggregate credit exposure limits and early remediation requirements that are required to be established under sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act. In 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill that would introduce a multi-pronged factor-based approach, rather than the current threshold of $50 billion in total consolidated assets, to be used in determining the financial institutions subject to enhanced prudential standards. As of the date of this report, the U.S. Senate had not approved such bill and the Corporation cannot predict whether the bill will be enacted into law and whether such a law would alter the way in which the enhanced prudential standards are applied to the Corporation, if enacted.

Resolution Planning.

As required by Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have jointly issued a final rule requiring each U.S. bank holding company with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, including the Corporation, to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for such bank holding company’s rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. In addition, the FDIC has issued a final rule requiring insured depository institutions with more than $50 billion in total assets, including the Bank, to submit to the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of such institution’s failure. The Corporation and the Bank submitted resolution plans pursuant to these rules in December 2015. On March 24, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC provided joint written feedback to the Corporation regarding the resolution plan submitted by the Corporation in December 2015 pursuant to Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “2015 165(d) Plan”). The joint written feedback identified certain “shortcomings” in the Corporation’s 2015 165(d) Plan. While the identification of these shortcomings is different from a determination that the plan is not “credible”, the Corporation was required to address the shortcomings in a satisfactory manner in the Corporation’s resolution plan to be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC by December 31, 2017. This plan was submitted on December 19, 2017. If the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC jointly decide that the Corporation’s 2017 resolution plan fails to address the identified shortcomings in a satisfactory manner, then the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC could jointly determine that the 2017 resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In the event of such a joint determination, the Corporation could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, restrictions on growth, activities


or operations, or be required to divest certain assets or operations. Separately, the European Union Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), was adopted for European Union credit institutions, including certain of the Bank’s subsidiaries and branches, effective January 1, 2015. In accordance with applicable Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) guidance, a recovery plan for Northern Trust Global Services Limited (NTGSL), a U.K. incorporated indirect subsidiary of the Bank, has been established and will be reviewed at least annually. PRA guidance also requires institutions to produce resolution planning information. In accordance with such guidance, a resolution pack for NTGSL and the Bank’s London branch has been prepared and such information will be reviewed every two years. The Corporation and the Bank have and will continue to focus management attention and substantial resources to meet U.S. and European regulatory expectations with respect to these resolution planning requirements.

Orderly Liquidation Authority.

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, such as the Corporation and certain of its covered subsidiaries, can be subjected to a new orderly liquidation authority. For the orderly liquidation authority to apply, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must make a determination, among other things, that the Corporation is in default or danger of default, the failure of the Corporation and its resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States, no viable private sector alternative is available to prevent the default of the Corporation, and orderly liquidation authority proceedings would mitigate these adverse effects. This determination must be recommended by two-thirds of the FDIC Board of Directors and two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board. Absent such actions, the Corporation, as a bank holding company, would remain subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The orderly liquidation authority became effective in July 2010, and rulemaking is proceeding in stages. If the Corporation were subject to orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would be appointed as its receiver, which would give the FDIC considerable powers to resolve the Corporation, including: (1) the power to remove officers and directors and appoint new ones; (2) the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review; (3) the ability to differentiate among creditors, including by treating junior creditors better than senior creditors, subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what such senior creditors would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and (4) broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership to creditors not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution.

The Volcker Rule

. The Volcker Rule bans proprietary trading subject to exceptions for market-making, hedging, certain trading activities in U.S. and foreign sovereign debt, certain trading activities of non-U.S. banking entities trading outside the United States, and trading activities related to liquidity management. The Volcker Rule also maintains significant restrictions on sponsoring or investing in certain “covered funds,” such as hedge funds or private equity funds. A banking entity may “organize and offer” certain private funds only if certain requirements are satisfied. Moreover, a banking entity only may retain a limited ownership interest in such funds, and must monitor and track investments in such covered funds carefully to ensure that the ownership interest in the fund does not exceed regulatory thresholds. A banking entity that sponsors or invests in certain private funds is also restricted from providing credit or other support to the funds or permitting the funds to use the name of the bank. The Volcker Rule requires large banking entities, including the Corporation, to implement a detailed compliance program and, on an annual basis, requires the Chief Executive Officer of the banking entity to attest that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule. Compliance with the Volcker Rule generally has been required since July 21, 2015. Northern Trust has conducted an enterprise-wide review of affected activities, taken steps to bring those activities into conformance, and has established an enterprise-wide compliance program to comply with the Volcker Rule. The full impact of the Volcker Rule on Northern Trust ultimately will depend on further interpretation and guidance by the regulatory agencies responsible for its enforcement. Northern Trust is monitoring developments with respect to the Volcker Rule actively and will revise further its operations and compliance programs as appropriate or required.

Swaps and Other Derivatives.

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act (Title VII) imposes a new regulatory structure on the over-the-counter derivatives market, including requirements for clearing, exchange trading, capital, margin, trade reporting, and recordkeeping. Title VII also requires certain persons to register as a “major swap participant,” a “swap dealer,” a “major-security-based swap participant” or a “security-based swap dealer.” The CFTC has finalized most rules further defining these registrant categories, while the SEC continues to draft rules related to security-based swaps. The CFTC’s Title VII rules and regulations are applicable to the Bank’s activity as a swap dealer and include rules related to internal and external business conduct standards, reporting and recordkeeping, mandatory clearing for certain swaps, and trade documentation and confirmation requirements, and applied certain regulatory requirements to cross-border swap activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has finalized regulations applicable to the Bank regarding mandatory posting and collection of margin by certain swap entities. The SEC’s rules related to security-based swaps are not currently applicable to the Bank’s swap dealing activity and the Bank’s current trading activity will not mandate its regulation as a security-based swap dealer. It is anticipated that the SEC will continue with its rulemaking process, which will further clarify, among other things, margin requirements for uncleared security-based swaps, central clearing requirements, and exchange-


traded requirements for security-based swaps. Northern Trust is monitoring Title VII-related regulatory developments and will revise further its operations and/or swaps compliance program as appropriate or required.

Incentive Compensation Arrangements.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires federal regulators to prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding incentive-based compensation practices at certain large financial institutions. No final rule has been issued to date.

HOLDING COMPANY SUPPORT UNDER THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACT

The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to obligate the Federal Reserve Board to require bank holding companies, such as the Corporation, to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution. The term “source of financial strength” is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries. Under this requirement, the Corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should the Bank experience financial distress.

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS

The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The Corporation may pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the Federal Reserve Board and as to which the Federal Reserve Board has not objected. A significant source of funds for the Corporation is dividends from the Bank. As a result, the Corporation’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations and fund dividend payments. Dividend payments from the Bank are subject to Illinois law and to regulatory limitations, generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings, imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability, financial condition or cash flow requirements.

Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to the Corporation without regulatory approval. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for payment of any dividend by a state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year (including any prospective dividend) would exceed the total of its retained net income (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its “undivided profits,” as defined, without regulatory and stockholder approval.

The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the Bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the Bank to become undercapitalized. In addition, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The payment of dividends could, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III (as defined and discussed further below) impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends.

CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING

The Corporation’s capital distributions are subject to Federal Reserve Board oversight. The major component of that oversight is the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercise, implementing its capital plan rules. These rules require bank holding companies having $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets (including the Corporation) to submit annual capital plans to their respective Federal Reserve Bank. The Corporation also is required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the Federal Reserve Board to monitor progress against the annual capital plans. The CCAR exercise is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies as well as of the processes used by certain bank holding companies to assess their capital needs. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve Board assesses whether bank holding companies have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. The Corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan as to which the Federal Reserve Board has not objected. The Federal Reserve Board may object to a capital plan for a number of reasons, including if the capital plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will meet, for each quarter throughout the nine-quarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan, all minimum regulatory capital ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for that quarter, as well as all minimum regulatory capital ratios on a pro forma basis under the base case and stressful scenarios. The capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered bank holding company may not make a capital distribution, unless after giving effect to the distribution, it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios.


On January 30, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board announced modifications to capital plan and stress testing rules. Under the modified final rules, the qualitative assessment of CCAR was removed for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between $50 billion and $250 billion, irrespective of the amount of on-balance-sheet foreign exposure held by such bank holding companies. As a result, capital plans submitted by the Corporation are no longer subject to objection from the Federal Reserve Board on qualitative grounds. In lieu of the qualitative assessment of CCAR, the Corporation is subject to a horizontal capital review (HCR), focusing on specific areas of capital planning, conducted as part of the Federal Reserve Board’s normal supervisory process. Any supervisory findings resulting from the HCR are addressed through supervisory communications. Capital plans submitted by the Corporation remain subject to objection from the Federal Reserve Board on quantitative grounds.

The Corporation submitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board in April 2017 as part of the Federal Reserve Board’s 2017 CCAR exercise, and the Federal Reserve Board did not object to the Corporation’s plan. The Corporation will submit its 2018 capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board by April 5, 2018. The Federal Reserve Board is expected to publish either its objection or non-objection to the 2018 capital plan and proposed capital actions, such as dividend payments and share repurchases, in mid-2018.

In addition to the CCAR stress testing requirements, Federal Reserve Board regulations include Dodd-Frank Act stress tests (DFAST). Under the DFAST regulations, the Corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve Board annually, and to conduct internal stress tests pursuant to regulatory requirements semi-annually. The Bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test (although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the Corporation). These requirements involve both company-run and supervisory-run testing of capital under various scenarios, including baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator. Results from the Corporation’s and the Bank’s annual company-run stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and published. Northern Trust published the results of its company-run stress tests on June 22, 2017, and the results of its company-run mid-cycle stress tests on October 27, 2017.

CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS

The regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution’s financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies (including the Bank and the Corporation) are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. The final supervisory determination on an institution’s capital adequacy is based on the regulator’s assessment of numerous factors.

The risk-based capital guidelines that apply to the Corporation and the Bank are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, as implemented by the Federal Reserve Board (Basel III). The Basel III rules are currently being phased in, and will come into full effect by January 1, 2022.

To implement Basel III for bank holding companies, including the Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines. The federal banking regulators also established risk-based and leverage capital guidelines that FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, are required to meet. These regulations are generally similar to those established by the Federal Reserve Board for bank holding companies. The Bank’s risk-based and leverage capital ratios remained strong at

December 31, 2017

, and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by U.S. banking regulators.

Under the final Basel III rules, the Corporation is one of a small number of “core” banking organizations. The rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles, and to disclose publicly certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy. In order to implement the capital rules, a core banking organization, such as the Corporation, is required to complete satisfactorily a parallel run, in which it calculates capital requirements under both the Basel III rules and previously effective regulations. The Corporation and the Bank completed their parallel runs in 2014 and are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their risk-based capital ratios.

Pursuant to the Federal Reserve Board’s implementation in the final Basel III rules of a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Corporation is subject to a capital floor that is based on the Basel III standardized approach. The Corporation is therefore required to calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches, and is subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of its capital adequacy.


The risk-based and leverage capital ratios for the Corporation and the Bank, together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as “well-capitalized,” are provided in the following chart.

TABLE 1: RISK-BASED AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2017

In addition to the above, as of January 1 2018, advanced approaches institutions, such as the Corporation and the Bank, must comply with a supplementary leverage ratio. Under the supplementary leverage ratio rule, advanced approaches institutions are subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. Insured depository institutions that are advanced approaches institutions, such as the Bank, also are required to maintain at least a 3.0% supplementary leverage ratio to be considered “well-capitalized” under the rule. The supplementary leverage ratio differs from the leverage ratio in that the leverage ratio does not take into account certain off-balance-sheet assets and exposures that are reflected in the supplementary leverage ratio.

Basel III also introduced a capital conservation buffer, requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The minimum capital conservation buffer in 2018 is 1.875% and will increase to 2.5% for 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking organizations with a common equity Tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall. Basel III also introduced a “countercyclical buffer” of 0% to 2.5% of a banking organization’s total risk-weighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations, such as the Corporation, which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken. In general, the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures. The U.S. countercyclical buffer is currently set at 0%, and the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that generally it will provide a 12-month phase-in of changes to the minimum required countercyclical buffer and use the notice and comment process to communicate proposed changes to the public. Certain other jurisdictions in which the Corporation has credit exposures currently have countercyclical buffers set at levels greater than 0%, slightly increasing the weighted average countercyclical buffer to which the Corporation is subject.

LIQUIDITY STANDARDS

In addition to capital adequacy standards, Basel III introduced two quantitative liquidity standards: a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and a net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations, improve the banking industry’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. In September 2014, the U.S. banking agencies finalized rules to implement the LCR in the United States for large banking organizations, such as the Corporation and the Bank. Among other things, the finalized LCR rules require covered banking organizations, which include the Corporation and the Bank, to maintain an amount of high-quality liquid assets (HQLAs) equal to or greater than 100% of the banking organization’s total net cash outflows over a thirty-calendar-day standardized supervisory liquidity stress scenario. The LCR has been fully implemented since January 1, 2017. Currently, Northern Trust is required to calculate its LCR on a daily basis. Daily calculation of the LCR has been required since July 2016. Additionally, on December 19, 2016, the Federal Reserve Board finalized rules that will require large banking organizations, such as the Corporation, to disclose publicly certain LCR information on a quarterly basis; these disclosure rules are being phased in through October 2018.

The NSFR requires banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance-sheet activities. More specifically, the NSFR requires that the ratio of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding be equal to at least 100% on an ongoing basis. The Basel Committee finalized its NSFR rules in October 2014, which were to be implemented by the Federal Reserve Board as a minimum


standard by January 1, 2018. The Federal Reserve Board issued a proposal on May 3, 2016 to implement the NSFR, but has not adopted a final rule.

The enhanced prudential standards (discussed above) specify certain liquidity risk management practices to be followed by covered large U.S. banks and bank holding companies, including the Corporation and the Bank. These practices include an independent review of liquidity risk management and the establishment of cash flow projections, a contingency funding plan, and liquidity risk limits. The Corporation’s Board of Directors (Board) also is required to establish and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered HQLAs based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing. This liquidity buffer must be tailored to Northern Trust’s business risks and is in addition to other liquidity requirements, such as the LCR and NSFR discussed above. The enhanced prudential standards also establish requirements and responsibilities for the Board of Directors and its Business Risk Committee with respect to liquidity risk management. The enhanced prudential standards require Northern Trust to engage in liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to its specific products and risk profile. The Board of Directors has approved a liquidity management policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the Corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position. Among other matters, this policy includes limits and thresholds related to the enhanced prudential standards liquidity buffer and the LCR.

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION

The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. While these regulations apply only to banks, such as the Bank, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company, such as the Corporation, based on the under-capitalized status of any banking subsidiary. In certain instances, the Corporation would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its under-capitalized banking subsidiary.

As noted above, the Federal Reserve Board has issued proposed rules to implement certain “early remediation requirements” applicable to U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more as required under Section 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Similar to prompt corrective action, the early remediation requirements would require firms subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the firm’s financial condition deteriorates. No final rule implementing Section 166 has been issued as of the date of this report.

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND INSIDERS

As an insured depository institution, the Bank is subject to restrictions which govern transactions between FDIC-insured banks and any affiliated entity, whether that entity is the Corporation, as the Bank’s parent holding company, a holding company affiliate of the Bank or a subsidiary of the Bank. Regulation W restrictions apply to certain “covered transactions,” including extensions of credit, issuance of guarantees, investments or asset purchases. In general, these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral and are limited, as to any one of the Corporation or such nonbank affiliates, to 10% of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus, and, as to the Corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus. These restrictions are also applied to transactions between the Bank and its financial subsidiaries. Furthermore, these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be, offered to nonaffiliated companies (i.e., at arm’s length).

The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements, and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. The definition of “affiliate” was expanded to include any investment fund to which the Corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser. The ability of the Federal Reserve Board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed, including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators. In addition, the provision in Section 23A that had permitted the Bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the Bank in an amount greater than 10% (but less than 20%) of the Bank’s capital and surplus has been eliminated.

The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as “insiders”) contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O apply to all federally insured institutions, including the Bank. These restrictions include, among others, limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans (including credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements) to insiders and their related interests. These loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus, and the FDIC may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of


applicable restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders.

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING, ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION, AND OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL

The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which contains anti-money laundering (AML) and financial transparency provisions and requires implementation of regulations applicable to financial services companies, including, but not limited to, standards for conducting due diligence, verifying client identification, and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities. AML laws outside the U.S. contain similar requirements. The Corporation and its subsidiaries have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable AML laws and regulations. Compliance with applicable AML laws and related requirements is a common area of review for financial regulators, and the Corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions or difficulties in obtaining approvals, restrictions on their business activities or harm to their reputation.

In May 2016, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a new rule that requires certain financial institutions, including the Bank, to obtain certain beneficial ownership information from legal entity clients. Compliance with the new rule is not required until May 2018, and it is possible that FinCEN may issue additional guidance regarding its implementation.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for requiring that U.S. entities do not engage in business with certain prohibited parties and jurisdictions, as defined by various executive orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, trafficking in narcotics, proliferating weapons of mass destruction or representing other threats to national security, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If the Corporation or the Bank finds a sanctioned name or jurisdiction on any transaction or account, the Corporation or the Bank must reject or block such account or transaction as required, and notify the appropriate authorities.

Many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the Corporation’s non-U.S. offices. The Corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions.

DEPOSIT INSURANCE AND ASSESSMENTS

The Bank accepts deposits, and eligible deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limit. The current limit for FDIC insurance for deposit accounts is $250,000 for each depositor account. Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency. The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions. Certain liquid assets are excluded from the deposit insurance assessment base of custody banks that satisfy certain institutional eligibility criteria. This has the effect of reducing the amount of deposit insurance fund insurance premiums due from custody banks. In March 2016, the FDIC finalized a surcharge assessment on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, such as the Bank, in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act requirement to increase the Deposit Insurance Fund’s minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% without increasing the assessments of small insured depository institutions. This surcharge assessment will remain in effect until such time as the reserve ratio reaches 1.35% or December 31, 2018, whichever occurs first. If the reserve ratio has not reached 1.35% by December 31, 2018, a shortfall assessment will be levied on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, placing new restrictions on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, such as the Bank, with respect to the deduction of all or a portion of all of their deposit insurance assessment payments as business expenses for federal taxation purposes. As a result of this tax law change, the Bank will not be able to deduct its FDIC deposit insurance assessment payments beginning in 2018.


FIDUCIARY RULE

The U.S. Department of Labor has issued a final regulation significantly expanding the concept of “investment advice” for the purpose of determining fiduciary status to employee benefits plans, plan participants, and individual retirement account (IRA) owners under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The final regulation became applicable on June 9, 2017. Pursuant to the final regulation, if an entity or individual is a fiduciary adviser under ERISA or the IRC, then that entity will be subject to procedural and other requirements related to (i) the services it performs for ERISA employee benefit plans and IRAs, subject to certain exemptions for advice given to “sophisticated independent fiduciaries,” and (ii) compensation or other benefits the institution or its affiliates receive in connection with those services. The original application date for full compliance was January 1, 2018. The Department of Labor has delayed the date by which entities and individuals must satisfy certain conditions of the prohibited transaction exemptions created or amended in connection with the new fiduciary rule until July 1, 2019. Specifically, the conditions in these exemptions relating to the “Impartial Conduct Standards” (as defined in such prohibited transaction exemptions) are the only conditions that must be satisfied by advice fiduciaries relying on such exemptions between June 9, 2017 and July 1, 2019. The other conditions of the exemptions, such as the specific disclosures and representations of fiduciary compliance in written communications with investors, were postponed until July 1, 2019, unless they are delayed further or revised before becoming effective. Furthermore, the Department of Labor has announced a temporary “non-enforcement policy” for those fiduciaries who are working diligently and in good faith to comply with the fiduciary rule and related exemptions. The Corporation is monitoring regulatory developments and reviewing and conforming its business practices as necessary to meet the requirements of the new fiduciary rule and related exemptions within the current implementation periods.

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT

The Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications, and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. In October 2012, the Federal Reserve Board, the federal regulator responsible for monitoring the Bank’s CRA compliance, approved the designation of the Bank as a “wholesale bank.” As a result of this designation, the Bank fulfills its CRA obligations by making qualified investments for the purposes of community development, rather than retail CRA loans. Federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. The Bank received an “outstanding” CRA rating from the Federal Reserve Board in its most recent CRA examination.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY

Federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by, among other provisions, requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information. Regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security, confidentiality and integrity of client information, and require notice of data breaches to regulators, and in some cases, to clients.

Most states, the European Union (EU) and other non-U.S. jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes and/or regulations concerning financial privacy and security and requiring notification of data breaches. For example, a new European data protection framework - the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - was adopted on April 8, 2016, and will become effective in all European Economic Area (EEA) member states on May 25, 2018. GDPR is designed to harmonize data privacy laws across the EEA, to protect EEA citizens’ data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. GDPR has extraterritorial effect as its scope includes all data controllers and processors outside the EEA whose processing activities relate to the offering of goods or services to, or monitoring the behavior of, EEA individuals.

The Corporation has adopted and disseminated privacy policies, and communicates required information relating to financial privacy and data security, in accordance with applicable law.


CONSUMER LAWS AND REGULATIONS

The Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits, making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such clients. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties, operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act established an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB was tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The creation of the CFPB by the Dodd-Frank Act has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer financial protection laws.

NON-U.S. REGULATION

Northern Trust is subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which its non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries operate. For example, branches and subsidiaries conducting banking, fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the United Kingdom are authorized to do so pursuant to the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. They are authorized by the PRA or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and regulated by the FCA and, in some instances, also the PRA. The PRA and FCA exercise broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to revoke temporarily or permanently authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations, suspend registered employees, and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees.

Northern Trust’s European branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the EU and the member states in which they are domiciled. Moreover, Northern Trust’s non-European branches and subsidiaries conducting financial services activities also may be within the scope of these laws, given that some EU laws apply to the wider EEA, which includes not only all EU member states but also the non-EU member states Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and because of increasing extraterritorial effect of European legislation.

The following items provide a brief description of certain recently implemented and in-progress regulatory changes in the EU and UK relevant to the Corporation and its subsidiaries, in addition to the BRRD and GDPR discussed under “The Dodd-Frank Act – Resolution Planning” and “Privacy and Security”, respectively, above.

EU Central Securities Depositories Regulation.

On September 17, 2014 the EU Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) entered into force. The CSDR aims principally to ensure that transactions between buyers and sellers of dematerialized securities are settled in a safe and timely manner by introducing common securities settlement standards across the EU. Implementing provisions adopted by the EU Commission were published on March 10, 2017.

Securities Financing Transactions and Reuse of Collateral Regulation.

On November 25, 2015, the EU adopted a regulation on securities financing transactions and reuse of collateral (SFTR) as part of its approach to addressing shadow banking. The regulation includes provisions for enhanced transparency and reporting of securities financing transactions. The SFTR became applicable on January 12, 2016, subject to certain transitional provisions.

Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive.

On June 26, 2017, the Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive (MLD4) became effective in all EU member states. MLD4 is designed to strengthen the EU’s defenses against money laundering and terrorist financing, while also ensuring that the EU framework is aligned with the Financial Action Task Force’s February 2012 anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards, which are the recognized international standards. On the same day, the revised “EU regulation on information accompanying transfers of funds”, or “Wire Transfer Regulation” (WTR) became law in all EU member states. The WTR sets out the minimum requirements on information that should be included in SWIFT payment messages to ensure the traceability of transfers of funds.

EU Benchmarks Regulation.

On January 1, 2018, the EU Benchmarks Regulation (BMR) entered into force. The principal objectives of the BMR are to restore investor confidence in the accuracy, robustness and integrity of indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, and the benchmark-setting process itself. The BMR aims to achieve this by ensuring that benchmarks are not subject to conflicts of interest, are used appropriately, and reflect the actual market or economic reality they are intended to measure.

Market in Financial Instruments Directive.

On January 3, 2018, the recast Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) was transposed into the local laws of EU member states. MiFID II, together with the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR), repeals and recasts the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004/39/EC) (MiFID). Together, MiFID II and MiFIR form the EU legal framework governing the requirements applicable to investment firms, trading venues, data reporting service providers and third-country firms providing investment services or activities in the EU.


Payment Services Directive.

On January 13, 2018, the recast Payment Services Directive (PSD II) was transposed into the local laws of EU member states. PSD II provides the legal foundation for an EU single market for payments to establish safer and more innovative payment services across the EU.

EU Money Market Funds Regulation.

On June 30, 2017, the EU adopted a regulation on money market funds (MMFR) with a view of making money market funds more resistant to crises and market turbulence. The MMFR will be effective July 21, 2018 for new money market funds and January 21, 2019 for existing money market funds, and it will impose detailed rules relating to the investment policies, risk management and other operational aspects of such funds. Further regulation containing the technical implementation of the MMFR has not yet been published.

European Deposit Insurance Scheme.

On October 11, 2017, the EU Commission announced that it aims to complete all parts of the European Banking Union by 2018. This will require, among other things, the creation of a single European Deposit Insurance Scheme.

In addition to the above, the Bank’s and the Corporation’s subsidiary banks located outside the United States are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of

December 31, 2017

, each of our non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements.

Staff

Northern Trust employed approximately

18,100

full-time equivalent staff members as of

ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS

In the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks. The following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to Northern Trust. Although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations, you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as: reducing the price of our common stock and other securities; reducing our capital, which can have regulatory and other consequences; affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us, with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses; and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers, which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so. Further, additional risks beyond those discussed below, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in other of our reports filed with, or furnished to, the SEC also could affect us adversely. We cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face.

These risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements” included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Market Risks

We are dependent on fee-based business for a majority of our revenues, which may be affected adversely by market volatility, a downturn in economic conditions, underperformance and/or negative trends in investment preferences.

Our principal operational focus is on fee-based business, which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interest-generating products and services. Fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management, custody or administration; the volume of transactions processed; securities lending volume and spreads; and fees for other services rendered, all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility, a downturn in economic conditions, underperformance and/or negative trends in investment preferences. For example, downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debt-related investments resulting from market disruption, illiquidity or other factors historically have reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others, which generally impacted our earnings negatively. Market volatility and/or weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation, investment preferences, trading activities, and savings patterns, which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide.

Our earnings also may be affected by poor investment returns or changes in investment preferences driven by factors beyond market volatility or weak economic conditions. For example, poor investment performance in funds or client accounts that we manage or in investment products that we design or provide that is due to underperformance relative to our competitors or benchmarks could result in declines in the market values of portfolios that we manage and/or administer and may affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients. Further, broader changes in investment preferences that lead to less investment in mutual funds or other collective funds, such as the recent shift in investor preference to lower fee products, could impact our earnings negatively.

Changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively.

The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. Although the Federal Reserve Board has raised the target Federal Funds rate range in recent years, interest rates generally remain low relative to historical levels. The low interest rate environment has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our net interest margin, which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. A continued low interest rate environment also may have a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products. For example, in recent years we have waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to short-term interest rate levels. While the recent Federal Funds rate increases have reduced significantly the amount of such fee waivers, they have not been altogether eliminated, and they could increase in the future if short-term interest rate levels decline. Low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings.

Conversely, a continued rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively. For example, we may be impacted negatively if such an increase were to cause: our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return, resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions; our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments, resulting in increased credit costs, provisions for loan and lease losses and charge-offs; reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity, resulting in lower performance, yield and fees; a decline in the value of


securities held in our portfolio of investment securities, resulting in decreased levels of capital and liquidity; or higher funding costs.

Further, although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks, if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect, these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective, which could impact earnings negatively.

Please see “Market Risk” in the “Risk Management” section included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face.

Changes in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the United States, non-U.S. governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively.

The monetary and other policies of U.S. and international governments, agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. For example, the Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing, which are important factors in our earnings. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold. Further, their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available, which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us. Changes in monetary and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict, and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Uncertainty about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe, including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets, could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings.

Risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world. Foreign market and economic disruptions have affected, and may continue to affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, personal bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt, and home prices. Economic challenges faced in various foreign markets, including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions, and any disruptions related to such challenges, may impact our earnings negatively.

The ultimate impact on us of the United Kingdom’s referendum regarding whether to remain part of the European

Union remains uncertain.

In June 2016, United Kingdom (“UK”) voters approved a departure from the European Union (the “EU”), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” In March 2017, the UK delivered a formal notice of withdrawal to the EU. The terms of the withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period expected to last at least two years from the withdrawal notification date and such negotiation period likely will be followed by additional negotiations between the EU and the UK concerning future relations between the parties. The ultimate impact of Brexit on the Corporation and the Bank remains uncertain and will depend on the terms of withdrawal and the post-Brexit relationships between the UK and other nations. Brexit has contributed, and may continue to contribute, to market volatility, particularly the valuation of the euro and British pound, and could have significant adverse effects on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, certain of our EU operations are conducted through subsidiaries located in the UK. If our UK subsidiaries are not able to retain their EU financial services “passport,” which permits activities throughout the single EU market without needing to obtain local authorizations, we may incur costs to move operations and personnel from our UK subsidiaries to new or existing subsidiaries in other EU member states, such as the planned move of our EU-banking headquarters to Luxembourg. During any such transition we may incur additional costs, as well as face greater operational risk and client concern with respect to our ability to maintain a high level of service delivery, particularly relative to those of our competitors with subsidiaries in other EU member states facing a lesser degree of cost or disruption. If our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them, our revenues will decrease accordingly.

Declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively.

Our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion, and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion, of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions. The value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio, which is generally determined based upon market values available from third-party sources, may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions. For example, the global financial crisis of 2007-08 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial


market disruption affected negatively the liquidity and pricing of securities, generally, and asset-backed and auction rate securities, in particular. Declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity. Further, to the extent that we experience unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities from declines in securities values that management determines to be other than temporary, the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination. Although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks, including hedging-related strategies, those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Accordingly, we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly.

Volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings.

We provide foreign exchange services to our clients, primarily in connection with our global custody business. Foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity. Foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income. Fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions, where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods. We also are exposed to non-trading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, and future non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expense.

We have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks, including hedging-related strategies. Any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively. Please see “Market Risk” in the “Risk Management” section included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face.

Changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively.

In past periods, reductions in the volatility of currency-trading markets, the level of cross-border investing activity, and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively. If these conditions occur in the future, our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively. In a few of our businesses, such as securities lending, our fee is calculated as a percentage of our client’s earnings, such that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues. For example, the global financial crisis of 2007-08 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption produced losses in some securities lending programs, reduced borrower demand and led some clients to withdraw from these programs. A return of these conditions in the future could result in additional withdrawals and decreased activity, which could impact our earnings negatively.

Operational Risks

Many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively.

We regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses. Despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk, our risk management program may not be effective in all cases. Factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size, scale and scope include:

•

failures of technological systems or breaches of security measures, including, but not limited to, those resulting from cyber-attacks;

•

human errors or omissions, including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures;

•

theft, fraud or misappropriation of assets, whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties;

•

defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems;

•

breakdowns in processes, over-reliance on manual processes, which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes, breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the systems and facilities that support our operations;

•

unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades;

•

defects in product design or delivery;

•

difficulty in accurately pricing assets, which can be aggravated by increased asset coverage, market volatility and illiquidity, and lack of reliable pricing from third-party vendors;

•

negative developments in relationships with key counterparties, third-party vendors, employees or associates in our day-to-day operations; and


•

external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as natural disasters, epidemics, computer viruses, geopolitical events, political unrest or acts of terrorism.

While we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors, these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively. We also may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businesses-particularly as we expand our geographic footprint, product pipeline and client types-and consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion. If our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully, such factors may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions. We continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture, ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate for our role as a major financial institution. Nonetheless, if we fail to provide the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk, our business could be impacted adversely.

Failures of our technological systems or breaches of our security measures, including, but not limited to, those resulting from cyber-attacks, may result in losses.

Any failure, interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations. Our systems involve the use of clients’ and our proprietary and confidential information, and security breaches, including cyber-attacks, could expose us to a risk of theft, loss or other misappropriation of this information. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients’ proprietary and confidential information, resulting in theft, loss or other misappropriation of this information.

Information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists, organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state actors. If we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective cyber-security relative to the type, size and complexity of our operations, we could become more vulnerable to cyber-attack. Additionally, our computer, communications, data processing, networks, backup, business continuity or other operating, information or technology systems, including those that we outsource to other providers, may fail to operate properly or become disabled, overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities.

The third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks (including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely), and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely, perhaps materially, by failures, terminations, errors or malfeasance by, or attacks or constraints on, one or more financial, technology, infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business. In addition, our clients often use their own devices, such as computers, smart phones and tablets, to manage their accounts, which may heighten the risk of system failures, interruptions or security breaches.

In recent years, several financial services firms suffered successful cyber-attacks launched both domestically and from abroad, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data, and reputational harm. Although we have not to our knowledge suffered a material breach of our systems, we and our clients have been subject to cyber-attacks, and it is possible that we could suffer a material breach in the future. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We expect to continue to face increasing cyber-threats, including computer viruses, ransomware and other malicious code, distributed denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our, our clients’ or other parties’ confidential, personal, proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt, compromise or damage our or our clients’ or other parties’ business assets, operations and activities. Our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyber-threats. If a breach of our security occurs, we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients, each of which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions,


service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our business. An event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services, which could be costly and have a negative impact on our business and reputation.

Further, even if not directed at us, attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of our business.

The systems and models we employ to analyze, monitor and mitigate risks, as well as for other business purposes, are inherently limited, may be not be effective in all cases and, in any case, cannot eliminate all risks that we face.

We use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories, as well as for other business purposes. However, these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate, nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Further, these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of the risks we face. Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations. These assumptions may be incorrect, and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant. Consequently, the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes, each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Errors in the underlying model or model assumptions, or inadequate model assumptions, could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences, including material loss or noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations.

Errors, breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability, result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways.

In our asset servicing, investment management, fiduciary administration and other business activities, we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money. Failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences, and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses. Given the high volume of transactions we process, errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected.

Our dependence on technology, and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure, exposes us to risks that also can result in losses.

Our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure, both internal and external, to record and process, among other things, a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data, in many currencies, on a daily basis, across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions. Due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations, we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure. Updating these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation, integration and security risks that could cause financial, reputational and operational harm. Failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations. The failure to respond properly to and invest in changes and advancements in technology could limit our ability to attract and retain clients, prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors, inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations.

A failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system will be met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. In addition, there are risks that individuals, either employees or contractors, consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by, for example, exceeding trading or investment management limitations, or committing fraud.


Failure of any of our third-party vendors to perform can result in losses.

Third-party vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, and network access. Our use of third-party vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us, including with respect to indemnification and information security, and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers. While we have established risk management processes and continuity plans, any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business. Replacing these third-party vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could create significant delay and expense.

We are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely.

In conducting our U.S. and non-U.S. business, we are subject to risks of loss from various unfavorable political, economic, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations. Less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets, in which we have been expanding our business activities. Our non-U.S. operations accounted for

32%

of our revenue in


. Our non-U.S. businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies. Moreover, the regulatory and supervisory standards and expectations in one jurisdiction may not conform with standards or expectations in other jurisdictions. Even within a particular jurisdiction, the standards and expectations of multiple supervisory agencies exercising authority over our affairs may not be harmonized fully. Accordingly, it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally. The failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could affect our business and results of operations adversely.

We actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint. This optimization may occur by establishing operations in lower-cost locations or by outsourcing to third-party vendors in various jurisdictions. These efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality, control or effective management within these operations. In addition, we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic, political and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions. The increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk. During periods of transition, greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery.

In addition, we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments and money laundering, laws relating to doing business with certain individuals, groups and countries, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the UK Bribery Act, and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar agencies worldwide. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring, the geographic diversity of our operations, employees, clients and customers, as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal, presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules, regulations, laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely.

Failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively.

Our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results. Through various parts of our business strategy, we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses, including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets. Failure to control these and other costs could affect our earnings negatively and reduce our competitive position. In October 2017, we announced our “Value for Spend” expense management initiative, through which we intend to realize $250 million in expense run-rate savings by 2020 through improved organizational alignment, process optimization and strategic sourcing. We cannot provide assurance that such initiative will be successful, nor can we predict its overall effect on our financial condition or results of operations.


Acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations.

Acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, global conflicts or other similar catastrophic events could have a negative impact on our business and operations. While we have in place business continuity plans, such events could still damage our facilities, disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business (including communications and technology), result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees, and have a similar impact on our clients, suppliers, third-party vendors and counterparties. These events also could impact the purchase of our products and services negatively to the extent that those acts or conflicts result in reduced capital markets activity, lower asset price levels, or disruptions in general economic activity in the United States or abroad, or in financial market settlement functions. In addition, war, terror attacks, political unrest, global conflicts, national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities may impact economic growth negatively, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations, and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict.

Credit Risks

Failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings.

We evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, including undrawn credit commitments. This process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments. Challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors. Allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet, which in turn would affect earnings negatively.

Market volatility and/or weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings.

Credit risk levels and our earnings also can be affected by market volatility and/or weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit. Adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from market volatility and/or weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans, which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of operations negatively.

The failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss.

The financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions, including banks, broker/dealers, collective investment funds and insurance companies. As a result of these interconnections, we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions. This counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss. Instability in the financial markets has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy. During such periods of instability, we are exposed to increased counterparty risks, both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients. Changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly, are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict. In addition, the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain. Further, the consolidation of financial service firms and the failures of other financial institutions has in the past, and may in the future increase the concentration of our counterparty risk. We are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients’ counterparty credit risk. If a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us, we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Liquidity Risks

If we do not effectively manage our liquidity, our business could suffer.

Liquidity is essential for the operation of our business. Market conditions, unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. If our access to stable and low-cost sources of funding, such as customer deposits, are reduced, we may need to use alternative funding, which could be more expensive or of limited availability. Further evolution in the regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively. Additional regulations may impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions, including the Corporation and the Bank.


Given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes, the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation. For more information on these regulations and other regulatory changes, see “Supervision and Regulation-Liquidity Standards” in Item 1, “Business,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could affect our business adversely.

If the Bank is unable to supply the Corporation with funds over time, the Corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations.

The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries. The Corporation relies on dividends paid to it by the Bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the Corporation. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the Corporation by dividend or otherwise. Dividend payments by the Bank to the Corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the Bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances. For more information on dividend restrictions, see “Supervision and Regulation-Payment of Dividends” in Item 1, “Business,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms.

We may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments, to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients, to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes, including capital rules, or for other purposes. However, our ability to access the capital markets, if needed, will depend on a number of factors, including the state of the financial markets. Rising interest rates, disruptions in financial markets, negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength, or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. Any diminished ability to raise additional capital, if needed, could subject us to liability, restrict our ability to grow, require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan, capital plan and strategic goals adversely.

Any downgrades in our credit ratings, or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength, could affect our borrowing costs, capital costs and liquidity adversely.

Rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control, such as rating-agency-specific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types, which are subject to revision from time to time, and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally.

Downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs, our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity adversely. A failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products. Additionally, our counterparties, as well as our clients, rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us. If we experience diminished financial strength or stability, actual or perceived, a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating, our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions, secured or unsecured, with us, our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers, or our prospective clients may select other service providers, all of which may have other adverse effects on our business.

The risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation, and in some instances failure, of financial institutions, including major global financial institutions, could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors. If our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty, our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients, on our or our clients’ behalf, will be compromised materially. If our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them, our revenues will decrease accordingly.

Our success with large, complex clients requires substantial liquidity.

A significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large, complex clients, which, by their nature, require substantial liquidity. Our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow.


Regulatory and Legal Risks

Failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business, or that reduce earnings.

Virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated, generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions. In the United States, the Corporation, the Bank and many of the Corporation’s other subsidiaries are regulated heavily by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. These regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities. They are directed specifically at protecting depositors, the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole, not our stockholders or other security holders. The Corporation and its subsidiaries also are regulated heavily by bank, securities and other regulators globally. Regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties, require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business, result in limitations on our ability to conduct business, restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely. Failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely. Similarly, changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively.

The ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act may have a material effect on our operations.

The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has had a significant impact on the regulatory and compliance structure in which we operate. While the current Presidential administration and U.S. Congress have indicated that the Dodd-Frank Act may be subject to scrutiny and that some of its provisions may be amended or repealed, there remains uncertainty surrounding the manner in which certain of the existing provisions will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies. In February 2017, an executive order was issued by the President (i) establishing core principles for regulating the U.S. financial system and (ii) instructing the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to consult with heads of the member agencies of the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council and to issue reports that identify laws, regulations, and policies, including those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act, that inhibit federal regulation of the U.S. financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles. Certain of the required reports were issued during 2017, and additional reports may be issued in the future. Further changes to or resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act, the February 2017 executive order, or the reports issued by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, or otherwise affect our business adversely. These legislative and/or regulatory changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.

Failure to address shortcomings identified by regulators in our 2015 resolution plan could result in restrictions or directives that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business.

Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations jointly issued by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC require bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in assets, which includes the Corporation, to annually submit a resolution plan to the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC detailing the bank holding company’s plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. If the regulators jointly determine that our resolution plan is not “credible” or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Corporation could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, restrictions on growth, activities or operations, or be required to divest certain assets or operations. On March 24, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC jointly identified certain “shortcomings” in the resolution plan submitted by the Corporation in December 2015. While the identification of shortcomings is different from a determination that the plan is not credible, the Corporation was required to address satisfactorily the identified shortcomings in the Corporation’s resolution plan to be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC by December 31, 2017. The Corporation submitted this resolution plan on December 19, 2017. If the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC jointly decide that the Corporation’s 2017 resolution plan fails to address the identified shortcomings in a satisfactory manner, then the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC could jointly determine that the 2017 resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and could subject us to the measures described above.

Changes in regulatory capital requirements could result in reduced earnings.

The Dodd-Frank Act and the implementation of Basel III have led to significantly higher capital requirements, higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios, and could impact the capital allocations to various business activities. The ultimate impact of the evolving capital and liquidity standards on us will depend on a number of factors, including the interpretation and implementation of capital and leverage requirements by the U.S. banking regulators. Increased capital requirements ultimately could impact the profitability of certain of our business activities,


require changes to certain business practices or otherwise affect our business and earnings adversely. See “Supervision and Regulation” under Item 1, “Business,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the various capital and liquidity requirements to which we are, and in the future may be, subject.

Changes by the U.S. and other governments to policies involving the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make compliance with the evolving laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies more difficult and costly.

In the past several years, various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny through many regulatory initiatives, including anti-money-laundering rules, anti-bribery laws, and loan-modification requirements. These and other regulatory requirements have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation. While we have programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees. Governments may take further actions to change significantly the way financial institutions are regulated, either through new legislation, new regulations, new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods. We cannot currently predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business. Additionally, governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry, and likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies. Any such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks, lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation, affect our ability to compete successfully, and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways. The full scope and impact of possible legislative or regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory activity is uncertain and difficult to predict.

We may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation, including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities.

Our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us, claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them. Our trust, custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk. This risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit, equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile, or when clients or investors are experiencing losses. In addition, as a publicly-held company, we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws, and volatility in our stock price and those of other financial institutions increases this risk. Claims made or actions brought against us, whether founded or unfounded, may result in injunctions, settlements, damages, fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business. Even if we defend ourselves successfully, the cost of litigation is often substantial, and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties, rating agencies and stockholders, consequently affecting our earnings negatively.

We may be impacted adversely by regulatory enforcement matters.

In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to various regulatory, governmental and enforcement inquiries, investigations and subpoenas. These may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us. In conjunction with enforcement matters, we may face claims for disgorgement, the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of other remedial sanctions, any of which could have an adverse impact on us.

We may fail to set aside adequate reserves for, or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to, pending and threatened claims, with a negative effect on our earnings.

We estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims, and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to GAAP, by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations. This process is inherently subject to risk, including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case. Our earnings will be affected adversely to the extent that our reserves are not adequate.


If we fail to comply with legal standards, we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients, which could affect our earnings negatively.

Managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important. Failure to comply with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws, manage adequately risks or manage appropriately the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities may subject us to liability or cause client dissatisfaction, which may impact negatively our earnings and growth.

Strategic Risks

If we do not execute strategic plans successfully, we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be impacted negatively.

Our growth depends upon successful, consistent execution of our business strategies. A failure to execute these strategies will impact growth negatively. A failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business. The challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners, delivering enhanced products and services, as well as combining accounting, data processing and internal control systems. To the extent we enter into transactions to acquire complementary businesses and/or technologies, we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions, which could result in increased costs, lowered revenues, ineffective deployment of capital, regulatory concerns, exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation. These risks may be increased if the acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations.

Execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents, which may include approvals of the Federal Reserve Board and other domestic and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities. Further, acquisitions we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals, if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied.

Competition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel.

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees, and continue to compensate our employees competitively. Competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel. Factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs, our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees. Our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs. These regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel, both in businesses and corporate functions, could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our markets, operations and clients, years of industry experience and, in some cases, the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. Similarly, the loss of key employees, either individually or as a group, could affect our clients’ perception of our abilities adversely.

We are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses, which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings.

We provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets. We compete against large, well-capitalized, and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices. In certain businesses, such as foreign exchange trading, electronic networks present a competitive challenge. Additionally, technological advances and the growth of internet-based commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business. Many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures. The same may be said for competitors based in non-U.S. jurisdictions, where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those applicable to the Corporation and the Bank as U.S.-domiciled financial institutions. These competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow. Pricing pressures, as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price, also may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services, which could have, and in some cases has had, a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.


Damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete, grow and generate revenue.

Damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and accordingly affect our earnings negatively. Damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies, regulators, stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business. Failure to maintain our reputation ultimately would have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively. Further, whereas negative public opinion once was driven primarily by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the proliferation of social media channels utilized by us and third parties, as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, may increase the risk of negative publicity, including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate, misleading or false information, which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences.

We need to invest in innovation constantly, and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively.

Our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation, particularly in light of the current “FinTech” environment, in which financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies and developing potentially industry-changing new products, services and industry standards. Our investment is directed at generating new products and services, and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace. Among other things, investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins. Our investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients, and includes investment in technological innovation as well. Effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important. Falling behind our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities, growth and earnings adversely. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts. We must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services, and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met. Further, our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require start-up costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all.

Failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will affect our businesses and earnings negatively.

The success of our innovation efforts depends, in part, on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives. Not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings, but we must accurately price them (as well as existing products) on a risk-adjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively. Our identification of risks arising from new products and services, both in their design and implementation, and effective responses to those identified risks, including pricing, is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings.

Our success with large, complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal, regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions.

A significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large, complex clients which require an understanding of the market and legal, regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions. Any failure to understand, address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation negatively. We identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls. If we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully, we could incur financial loss, suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably, or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive. In addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. We may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements, our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion. If our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets, legal and regulatory requirements, our businesses, our counterparties, clients or service providers or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations. These risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires end-to-end management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many inter-related products and services.


Failure to produce adequate and competitive returns can affect our earnings and growth prospects negatively.

We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our investment management, fiduciary and asset-servicing businesses. If we do not generate competitive risk-adjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes, we will have greater difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business, which would affect our earnings negatively.

We may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings.

We may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings, liquidity or valuation issues or other developments, even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments. The risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted.

Other Risks

Changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negatively.

Both U.S. and non-U.S. governments and tax authorities, including states and municipalities, from time to time issue new, or modify existing, tax laws and regulations. These authorities may also issue new, or modify existing, interpretations of those laws and regulations. These new laws, regulations or interpretations, and our actions taken in response to, or reliance upon, such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that affects our earnings negatively.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act includes a number of changes in existing tax law impacting businesses including, among other things, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, disallowance of certain deductions that had previously been allowed, limitations on interest deductions, alteration of the expensing of capital expenditures, adoption of a territorial tax system, assessment of a repatriation tax or “toll-charge” on undistributed earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign corporations, and introduction of certain anti-base erosion provisions. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a net tax benefit of $53.1 million associated with the Act; however, the ultimate impact of the Act on our financial condition and results of operations in 2018 and future years remains uncertain and may differ materially from our expectations due to the issuance of technical guidance regarding elements of the Act, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made with respect to the Act, and changes to the competitive landscape in which we operate and other factors.

In the course of our business, we are sometimes subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities, including states and municipalities, regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise affect earnings negatively.

Changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

New accounting standards, changes to existing accounting standards, or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the International Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or bank regulatory agencies, or otherwise reflected in GAAP, potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. These changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities, or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods.

Our ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations, applicable provisions of Delaware law, or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt.

Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends and other distributions of capital as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments under Delaware law. Although we have declared cash dividends on shares of our common stock historically, we are not required to do so. In addition to the approval of our Board of Directors, our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital distributions, is dependent upon, among other things, their payment being made in accordance with a capital plan as to which the Federal Reserve Board has not objected. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve Board will not object to our future capital plans. In addition to imposing restrictions on our ability to return capital to stockholders, an objection by the Federal Reserve Board to a future capital plan would negatively impact our reputation and investor perceptions of us.


A significant source of funds for the Corporation is dividends from the Bank. As a result, our ability to pay dividends on the Corporation’s common stock will depend on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Corporation. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries can supply funds to the Corporation by dividend or otherwise. Dividend payments by the Bank to the Corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the Bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Corporation in the future, our ability to pay dividends on the Corporation’s common stock would be affected adversely.

Our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to our preferred stock as to the payment of dividends and/or the distribution of any assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation also generally will be prohibited in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends on our Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series C preferred stock) and Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series D preferred stock). Further, in the future if we default on certain of our outstanding debts or elect to defer interest payments on our Floating Rate Capital Debt we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such payments have been brought current.

Any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend, or even our failure to increase our common stock dividend along with our competitors, likely would have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.

For more information on dividend restrictions, see “Supervision and Regulation-Payment of Dividends” in Item 1, “Business,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Revenue

Northern Trust generates the majority of its revenue from noninterest income that primarily consists of trust, investment and other servicing fees. Net interest income comprises the remainder of revenue and consists of interest income generated by earning assets, net of interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds.

Revenue in


was

$5.38 billion

, an increase of

8%

from

$4.96 billion

in

73%

of total revenue in


compared to

75%

in


, and totaled

$3.95 billion

, up

6%

from

$3.73 billion

in


.

The current-year increase in noninterest income primarily reflected

higher trust, investment and other servicing fees, including revenue associated with the UBS acquisition, partially offset by lower other operating income, primarily due to income recorded in the prior year from the sale of Visa Inc. Class B common shares partially offset by impairment charges associated with our leasing portfolio, and lower foreign exchange trading income.

Trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled

$3.43 billion

in


, up

$326.2 million

in the prior year. The prior year included the sale of

1.1 million

Visa Inc. Class B common shares, net of the valuation adjustment to existing swap agreements, for a net gain of

$118.2 million

, partially offset by impairment charges and the loss on sale related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio and impairment charges related to the residual value of certain aircraft and rail cars of

$18.9 million

.

Net interest income on an FTE basis in


was

$1.48 billion

, an increase of

$215.0 million

, or

17%

, from

$1.26 billion

in


,

due to higher levels of average earning assets and an increased net interest margin.

Average earning assets increased

$4.1 billion

, or

4%

, in


, reflecting higher levels of securities and short-term interest bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease in loans and leases. The net interest margin on an FTE basis increased to

TABLE 3: NONINTEREST INCOME

Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees

Trust, investment and other servicing fees were

$3.43 billion

in


compared with

$3.11 billion

in


. Trust, investment and other servicing fees are based primarily on the market value of assets held in custody, managed and serviced; the volume of transactions; securities lending volume and spreads; and fees for other services rendered. Certain market value calculations on which fees are based are performed on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears. Based on an analysis of historical trends and current asset and product mix, management estimates that a 10% rise or fall in overall equity markets would cause a corresponding increase or decrease in Northern Trust’s trust, investment and other servicing fees of approximately 3% and in total revenue of approximately 2%. For a more detailed discussion of


trust, investment and other servicing fees, refer to the “Reporting Segments and Related Information” section.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income stated on an FTE basis is a non-generally-accepted-accounting-principle (GAAP) financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. Management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income. A reconciliation of net interest income on a GAAP basis to net interest income on an FTE basis is provided on page 86.

An analysis of net interest income on an FTE basis, major balance sheet components impacting net interest income and related ratios are provided below.

TABLE 13: ANALYSIS OF NET INTEREST INCOME (FTE)

Refer to pages 163 and 164 for additional analysis of net interest income.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net interest income is defined as the total of interest income and amortized fees on earning assets, less interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds, adjusted for the impact of interest-related hedging activity. Earning assets – including federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks, Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits, securities, and loans and leases – are financed by a large base of interest-bearing funds that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, senior notes and long-term debt. Earning assets also are funded by net noninterest-related funds, which include demand deposits, and stockholders’ equity, reduced by nonearning assets such as noninterest-bearing cash and due from banks, items in process of collection, and buildings and equipment. Net interest income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. In addition, the levels of nonperforming assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact net interest income.

Net interest income in


was

$1.43 billion

, up

$194.3 million

, or

16%

, from

$1.23 billion

in


. Net interest income on an FTE basis for


was

$1.48 billion

, an increase of

$215.0 million

, or

17%

, from

$1.26 billion

in


,

due to higher levels of average earning assets and an increased net interest margin.

Average earning assets increased

$4.1 billion

, or

4%

, to

$111.2 billion

from

$107.0 billion

in


, primarily reflecting higher levels of securities and short-term interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by reductions in loans and leases. The net interest margin in


was

1.29%

, up from

1.15%

in


. The net interest margin on an FTE basis in


was

1.33%

, up from

1.18%

in


.

Growth in average earning assets primarily reflected higher levels of Federal Reserve and other bank deposits and securities, partially offset by reductions in interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks and loans and leases. Federal Reserve and other bank deposits averaged

$23.9 billion

, an increase of

$3.5 billion

or

17%

, from

$20.4 billion

in


. Securities, inclusive of Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and certain community development investments which are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, averaged

$44.7 billion

, an increase of

$2.7 billion

in


. Interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks averaged

$7.1 billion

in

. Loans and leases averaged

$33.6 billion

, a decrease of

$478.3 million

, or

1%

, from

$34.0 billion

in


.

The increase in average earning assets was primarily funded by higher levels of interest-bearing deposits and short-term borrowings, partially offset by reductions of demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits increased

$6.0 billion

, or

9%

, to

$73.4 billion

in


from

$67.4 billion

in


. Average short-term borrowings increased

$359.0 million

. Average demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits decreased

$3.1 billion

, or

$23.1 billion

in


from

$26.2 billion

in


.

Stockholders’ equity averaged

$10.0 billion

in


, compared with

$9.1 billion

in


. The increase of

$895.3 million

, or

10%

, was attributable to current-year earnings, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation’s share repurchase program and dividend declarations. During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, the Corporation increased its quarterly common stock dividend by

11%

to

$0.42

per share and repurchased

5.8 million

shares, returning

$895.6 million

in capital to common stockholders, compared to

$754.7 million

in


.

Under the Corporation’s 2017 Capital Plan, which was reviewed without objection by the Federal Reserve, the Corporation may repurchase up to

$454.6 million

of common stock after

December 31, 2017

, through June 2018.

Provision for Income Taxes

Provisions for income tax and effective tax rates are impacted by levels of pre-tax income, tax rates, and the impact of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries whose earnings are reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, as well as nonrecurring items such as the resolution of tax matters and changes in income tax rates and tax laws. The


provision for income taxes was

$434.9 million

, representing an effective rate of

26.6%

. This compares with a provision for income taxes of

$484.6 million

and an effective rate of

31.9%

in


.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The current-year tax provision includes a net benefit attributable to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of

$53.1 million

as outlined below, an increased income tax benefit derived from the vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises, and Federal and State research tax credits of

$20.9 million

,

$17.6 million

of which were recognized related to the Corporation’s technology spend between 2013 and 2016, each resulting in a reduction of the effective tax rate.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017.

The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. It also requires companies to pay a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred.

At

December 31, 2017

, Northern Trust has made a reasonable estimate as to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as follows:

TABLE 16: IMPACT OF TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT

The amounts related to federal taxes on mandatory deemed repatriation and certain other adjustments are considered provisional as of

December 31, 2017

, as Northern Trust did not have the necessary information available to complete its accounting for the change in tax law and as such has provided a reasonable estimate. Northern Trust will continue to refine the related calculations as additional analyses are completed.

In addition, these provisional amounts may require adjustment based on an evolving understanding of the new tax law and the issuance of guidance by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

As a result of the changes in U.S. tax law, Northern Trust

expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 23% to 24% in 2018.

The income tax provision for


reflects reductions totaling

$50.0 million

related to certain non-U.S. subsidiaries whose earnings are being reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act being enacted on December 22, 2017, these earnings and the earnings from prior years which have been reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States are deemed to have been repatriated to the United States and subject to a repatriation tax. Northern Trust’s repatriation tax has been estimated to be

$150.0 million

and recorded as an income tax provision. The repatriation tax will be paid in installments over eight years as permitted under U.S. income tax laws.

The income tax provision of

$484.6 million

for


reflects reductions totaling

$50.1 million

related to certain non-U.S. subsidiaries whose earnings were reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States. The


income tax provision of

$491.2 million

represented an effective tax rate of

33.5%

, and reflects reductions of

$43.6 million

REPORTING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

Northern Trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: C&IS and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C&IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to C&IS and Wealth Management. Income and expense associated with the Corporation’s and the Bank’s wholesale funding activities and investment portfolios, as well as certain corporate-based expense, executive level compensation and nonrecurring items are not allocated to C&IS and Wealth Management, and are reported in Northern Trust’s third reporting segment, Treasury and Other, in the following pages.

C&IS and Wealth Management results are presented to promote a greater understanding of their financial performance. The information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is derived from internal accounting systems that support Northern Trust’s strategic objectives and management structure. Management has developed accounting systems to allocate revenue and expense related to each segment. These systems incorporate processes for allocating assets, liabilities and equity, and the applicable interest income and expense. Equity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, risk, regulatory considerations, and internal metrics. Allocations of capital and certain corporate expense may not be representative of levels that would be required if the segments were independent entities. The accounting policies used for management reporting are consistent with those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Transfers of income and expense items are recorded at cost; there is no consolidated profit or loss on


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

sales or transfers between reporting segments. Northern Trust’s presentations are not necessarily consistent with similar information for other financial institutions.

Corporate & Institutional Services

C&IS is a leading global provider of asset servicing and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors around the globe. Asset servicing and related services encompass a full range of capabilities including but not limited to: global custody; fund administration; investment operations outsourcing; investment management; investment risk and analytical services; employee benefit services; securities lending; foreign exchange; treasury management; brokerage services; transition management services; banking and cash management. Client relationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support from locations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.

The following table summarizes the results of operations of C&IS for the years ended

TABLE 18: C&IS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Note: Stated on an FTE basis.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The

24%

increase in C&IS net income in


compared to


primarily resulted from higher trust, investment and other servicing fees, which includes revenue associated with the UBS acquisition of

$21.1 million

, net interest income, and other noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense, which includes

$24.2 million

of higher costs associated with the UBS acquisition, and lower foreign exchange trading income. The

3%

increase in C&IS net income in


primarily resulted from higher net interest income and trust, investment and other servicing fees, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses and lower foreign exchange trading income and other noninterest income.

C&IS Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees

C&IS trust, investment and other servicing fees are primarily attributable to services related to custody, fund administration, investment management, and securities lending. Custody and fund administration fees are driven primarily by values of client assets under custody/administration, transaction volumes, and number of accounts. The asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. Custody fees related to asset values are client specific and are priced based on quarter-end or month-end values, values at the beginning of each quarter or average values for a month or quarter. The fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. Investment management fees, which are based generally on client assets under management, are based primarily on market values throughout a period.

Securities lending revenue is affected by market values; the demand for securities to be lent, which drives volumes; and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed. The other services fee category in C&IS includes such products as investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments, and other services. Revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee.

Provided below are the components of C&IS trust, investment and other servicing fees.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until the repurchase.

Loans and Leases

During 2017, the Corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes. As a result, the prior-period loan and lease balances below have been adjusted to conform with current-period presentation. The adjustments generally reflected reclassification of loans and leases from the commercial and institutional class to the residential real estate class. There was no impact on total loans and leases previously reported.

The following table presents the amounts outstanding of loans and leases by segment and class as of

December 31, 2017

and the preceding four year-ends.

TABLE 30: COMPOSITION OF LOAN PORTFOLIO

Residential Real Estate

The residential real estate loan portfolio is primarily composed of mortgages and home equity credit lines provided as an accommodation to clients. Residential real estate loans totaled

$7.2 billion

at

December 31, 2017

, or

22%

of total U.S. loans, compared with

$8.1 billion

, or

24%

of total U.S. loans, at

December 31, 2016

. All residential real estate loans are underwritten utilizing Northern Trust’s credit policies, which do not support the origination of loan types generally considered to be of high risk in nature, such as option ARM loans, subprime loans, loans with initial “teaser” rates, and loans with excessively high loan-to-value ratios. Residential real estate loans consist of traditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines that generally require a loan-to-collateral value of no more than

65%

to

80%

at inception. Appraisals of supporting collateral for residential real estate loans are obtained upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted. Residential real estate collateral appraisals are performed and reviewed by independent third parties.

Of the total

$7.2 billion

in residential real estate loans at

December 31, 2017

,

$1.9 billion

were in Florida,

$1.4 billion

were in the greater Chicago area, and

$1.4 billion

were in California, with the remainder distributed throughout the other geographic regions within the United States served by Northern Trust. Legally binding commitments to extend residential real estate credit, which are primarily equity credit lines, totaled

$1.0 billion

and

$1.2 billion

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

Commercial Real Estate

In managing its credit exposure, management has defined a commercial real estate loan as one where: (1) the borrower’s principal business activity is the acquisition or the development of real estate for commercial purposes; (2) the principal collateral is real estate held for commercial purposes, and loan repayment is expected to flow from the operation of the property; or (3) the loan repayment is expected to flow from the sale or refinance of real estate as a normal and ongoing part of the business. Unsecured lines of credit to firms or individuals engaged in commercial real estate endeavors are included without regard to the use of loan proceeds. The commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended primarily to investors well known to Northern Trust. Underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage requirements. Recourse to owners through guarantees also is commonly required.

Commercial mortgage financing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of income-producing properties. Cash flows from the properties generally are sufficient to amortize the loan. These loans are primarily located in the

Illinois

,

California

,

Florida

,

Texas

, and

markets. Construction, acquisition and development loans provide financing for commercial real estate prior to rental income stabilization. The intent is generally that the borrower will sell the project or refinance the loan through a commercial mortgage with Northern Trust or another financial institution upon completion.

The table below provides additional detail regarding commercial real estate loan types:

TABLE 31: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS

At

December 31, 2017

, legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to commercial real estate borrowers totaled

$312.5 million

and

Nonperforming Assets and 90 Days Past Due Loans

During 2017, the Corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain nonperforming loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes. As a result, the prior-period balances below have been adjusted to conform with current-period presentation. These adjustments generally reflect reclassification of nonperforming loans and leases from commercial and institutional class to the residential real estate class. There was no impact on total nonperforming loans and leases previously reported.

Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and leases and other real estate owned (OREO). OREO is comprised of commercial and residential properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans. Loans that are delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest can fluctuate widely at any reporting period based on the timing of cash collections, renegotiations and renewals. The following table presents nonperforming assets and loans that were delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing at

December 31, 2017

and each of the prior four year-ends.

TABLE 32: NONPERFORMING ASSETS

Nonperforming assets of

$155.3 million

as of

December 31, 2017

, decreased

$10.1 million

, or

6%

, reflecting improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio, partially offset by additional impaired loans in the commercial and institutional portfolio. Changes in the level of nonperforming assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes. Changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the specific allowance and of the qualitative factors used in the determination of the inherent allowance levels within the allowance for credit losses.

Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses

During 2017, the Corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes. The previously reported allowance for credit losses remains unadjusted, as the impact of the reclassification on the allowance was immaterial.

TABLE 33: CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The provision for credit losses is the charge to current period earnings that is determined by management, through a disciplined credit review process, to be the amount needed to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb probable credit losses that have been identified with specific borrower relationships (specific loss component) and for probable losses that are believed to be inherent in the loan and lease portfolios, undrawn commitments, and standby letters of credit (inherent loss component).

The following table shows the specific portion of the allowance and the allocated inherent portion of the allowance and its components by loan category at

December 31, 2017

, and at each of the prior four year-ends.

TABLE 34: ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Specific Component of the Allowance:

The amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows, collateral value, and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay.

At

December 31, 2017

, the specific allowance component amounted to

$5.4 million

compared with

$2.1 million

at the end of


. The

$3.3 million

increase is primarily attributable to additional allowances provided for new nonperforming loans, partially offset by charge-offs and pay-offs.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The decrease in the specific component of the allowance from

$3.1 million

in


to

$2.1 million

in


was primarily attributable to charge-offs and pay-offs, partially offset by additional allowances provided for new nonperforming loans.

Inherent Component of the Allowance:

The inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified credit-related losses. The inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit. To estimate the allowance for credit losses on these instruments, management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans.

The inherent portion of the allowance decreased

$41.5 million

to

$148.4 million

at

December 31, 2017

, compared with

$189.9 million

at

December 31, 2016

, which decreased

$40.3 million

from

$230.2 million

at

December 31, 2015

.

The decrease in


was primarily driven by continued improvement in the credit quality of the commercial real estate and residential real estate portfolios. The decrease in


was primarily driven by continued improvement in the credit quality of the residential real estate and private client portfolios.

Overall Allowance:

The evaluation of the specific component and the inherent component above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of

$153.8 million

at

December 31, 2017

, compared with

$192.0 million

at the end of


. The allowance of

$131.2 million

assigned to loans and leases, as a percentage of total loans and leases, was

0.40%

at

December 31, 2017

, down from a

$161.0 million

allowance, representing

0.48%

of total loans and leases, at

December 31, 2016

. Allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled

$22.6 million

and

$31.0 million

at

December 31, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

, respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Provision:

The provision for credit losses was a credit of

$28.0 million

and net charge-offs totaled

$10.2 million

in


. This compares with a credit provision of

$26.0 million

and net charge-offs of

$15.2 million

in


, and a

$43.0 million

credit provision and net charge-offs of

$19.5 million

in


.

Impaired Loans

A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtor’s financial difficulties, referred to as a troubled debt restructuring. As of

December 31, 2017

, impaired loans totaled

$139.8 million

and included

$98.4 million

of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of

$156.1 million

at

December 31, 2016

, which included

$127.6 million

of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings. Impaired loans had

$5.4 million

and

$2.1 million

of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at

December 31, 2017

, and

December 31, 2016

, respectively. Impaired loans are measured based upon the loan’s market price, the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan, dependent upon the level of certainty of loss, either a specific allowance is established or a charge-off is recorded for the difference. Smaller balance (individually less than $1 million as of

December 31, 2017

) homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and actual results could differ from those estimates. The SEC has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on Northern Trust’s future financial condition and results of operations.

For Northern Trust, accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and pension plan accounting. Management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee).


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses which have been incurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. The loan and lease portfolio and other lending-related credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses. In determining an appropriate allowance level, Northern Trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lending-related commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lending-related credit exposures.

The allowance for credit losses consists of the following components:

Specific Allowance:

The specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows, collateral value, and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay. For impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance, if any, is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management. These appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral.

Inherent Allowance:

The inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss data

specific to the Northern Trust loan and lease portfolio. The estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment

framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into segments. For each segment, the probability of default

and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance. The estimated allowance is reviewed by the Loan Loss Reserve Committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio. In determining the appropriate adjustment, management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology. The Loan Loss Reserve Committee is comprised of representatives from Credit Risk Management, the reporting segments and Corporate Finance.

The quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by Credit Risk Management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of, and adjustment for, changes in estimated credit loss levels. In addition to Northern Trust’s own experience, management also considers regulatory guidance. Control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate.

Loans, leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are charged-off or a specific reserve is established based on management’s assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss. The provision for credit losses, which is charged to income, is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process. Actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net charge-offs.

Management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. Management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, in determining an appropriate allowance level. Due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates, other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in


and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.

Additionally, as an integral part of their examination process, various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses. These agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. However, management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Pension Plan Accounting

Northern Trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees (the Qualified Plan) and a U.S. noncontributory supplemental pension plan (the Nonqualified Plan). Certain European-based employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans, of which the majority are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals. Measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates, asset returns, compensation increases, mortality rates, and other actuarially-based projections relating to the plans. Due to the long-term nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made, the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required. Pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. The differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants. As a result, differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders’ equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods.

Northern Trust recognizes the significant impact that these pension-related assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year. These procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans’ actuaries. In addition to actual experience, adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities, known compensation trends and policies, as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets.

In determining the pension expense for the U.S. plans in


, Northern Trust utilized a discount rate of

4.46%

for both the Qualified Plan and the Nonqualified Plan. The rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from

9.00%

to

2.50%

that averaged

4.39%

. The expected long-term rate of return on Qualified Plan assets was

6.75%

.

In evaluating possible revisions to pension-related assumptions for the U.S. plans as of Northern Trust’s

December 31, 2017

measurement date, the following were considered:

•

Discount Rate:

Northern Trust estimates the discount rate for its U.S. pension plans by applying the projected cash flows for future benefit payments to the Aon Hewitt AA Above Median yield curve as of the measurement date. This yield curve is composed of individual zero-coupon interest rates for 198 different time periods over a 99-year time horizon. Zero-coupon rates utilized by the yield curve are mathematically derived from observable market yields for AA-rated corporate bonds. This yield curve model referenced by Northern Trust in establishing the discount rate resulted in a rate of

3.79%

at

December 31, 2017

for the Qualified and Nonqualified plans, a decrease from

4.46%

at

December 31, 2016

.

•

Compensation Level:

Based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience, the compensation scale assumption is based on a graded schedule from

9.00%

to

2.50%

that averages

4.39%

.

•

Rate of Return on Plan Assets:

The expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the long-term (30 years) rate of return on plan assets, which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience, giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness. As a result of these analyses, Northern Trust’s rate of return assumption for the Qualified Plan decreased from 6.75% for


to 6.00% for


.

•

Mortality Table:

Northern Trust uses the aggregate RP-2014 mortality table with adjustment from 2014 to 2006. Northern Trust’s pension obligations reflect proposed future improvement under scale MP-2017, released by the Society of Actuaries in October 2017. This assumption was updated at

December 31, 2017

from improvement scale MP-2016. The updated improvement scale applies to annuity payments only and results in generally lower projected mortality improvements than estimated by the MP-2016 improvement scale. Mortality assumptions on lump sum payments remain static and continue to be in line with the IRS prescribed table for minimum lump sums in 2018. The IRS prescribed table for 2018 now reflects the aggregate RP-2014 mortality table with adjustment from 2014 to 2006, and future improvements under scale MP-2016.

Annual net pension expense in 2018 is expected to increase by approximately

$19 million

,

primarily driven by the decrease in discount rate and a lower expected rate of return on plan assets.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected U.S Plans’ periodic pension expense in


and the projected benefit obligation as of

December 31, 2017

, the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires certain assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value. As of

December 31, 2017

, approximately

25%

of Northern Trust’s total assets and approximately

1%

of its total liabilities were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As discussed more fully in Note 3, “Fair Value Measurements,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” GAAP requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted, active market prices for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place (Level 3). Approximately

17%

of Northern Trust’s assets carried at fair value are classified as Level 1. Northern Trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange.

Approximately

83%

of Northern Trust’s assets and

98%

of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as Level 2, as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. Investment securities classified as available for sale make up

97%

of Level 2 assets with the remaining

3%

primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments. Level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments.

Northern Trust’s Level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities, the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors. Northern Trust has a well-established process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in Note 3, “Fair Value Measurements,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

As of

December 31, 2017

, all derivative assets and liabilities, excluding the swap related to the sale of certain Visa Class B common shares described below, were classified as Level 2 and approximately

96%

, measured on a notional value basis, related to client-related and trading activities, predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts. Derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted income-based models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts. Northern Trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments. Factors considered included the likelihood of default by Northern Trust and its counterparties, the remaining maturities of the instruments, net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements, available collateral, and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments. The resulting valuation adjustments are not considered material.

As of

December 31, 2017

, the fair value of Northern Trust’s Level 3 assets was

$4.3 million

. Level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities purchased from Northern Trust clients. To estimate the fair value of auction rate securities, Northern Trust uses external pricing vendors that incorporate transaction details and market based inputs such as past auction results,


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

trades and bids. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are the prices of the securities supported by little market activity and for which trading is limited.

As of

December 31, 2017

, Northern Trust’s Level 3 liabilities consisted of swaps that Northern Trust entered into with the purchaser of

1.1 million

and

1.0 million

shares of Visa Class B common shares previously held by Northern Trust and sold in June 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pursuant to the swaps, Northern Trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into shares of Visa Inc. Class A common stock (Visa Class A common shares), such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and Northern Trust will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. The swaps also require periodic payments from Northern Trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of Visa Class A common shares and a fixed rate of interest. The fair value of the swaps are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are Northern Trust’s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares, the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the Visa Class A common share price. See “Visa Class B Common Shares” under Note 24, “Contingent Liabilities,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

While Northern Trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to Level 3 assets, could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09 is a converged standard between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers across transactions and industries. The primary objective of ASU 2014-09 is revenue recognition that represents the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.

Northern Trust adopted ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.

In 2017, Northern Trust focused efforts on completing an extensive contract review, covering services offered in each of its respective locations throughout the world, principal versus agent considerations, developing detailed disclosures required by ASU 2014-09 and assessing the extent of changes to the internal control environment.

Northern Trust recognizes the majority of its revenues “over time” under current policy and will continue this practice for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. ASU 2014-09 is not expected to require significant changes to revenue-related information technology applications. As a result of completing its implementation project, Northern Trust will disclose additional information related to revenue recognition and implement certain changes to gross vs. net presentation for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not impact significantly Northern Trust’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (ASU 2016-01).

ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income unless a policy election is made for investments without readily determinable fair values.

Additionally, ASU 2016-01 requires public entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for measurement purposes and eliminates the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. Furthermore, it requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.

Northern Trust adopted ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 will not impact significantly Northern Trust’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases onto the balance sheet, with certain specified scope exceptions. Specifically within the lessee model under ASU 2016-02, a lessee is required to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make future lease payments, known as the lease liability, and a right-of-use asset (ROU asset) representing its right to use the underlying asset over the lease term. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with certain practical expedients available.

Northern Trust has established an overall governance structure


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

and a detailed project plan for its implementation efforts, along with taking further action in defining the future operating model for lease accounting and administration.

Northern Trust does not expect a significant change in leasing activity between now and adoption on January 1, 2019. Although Northern Trust is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-02, it

is expected to have a significant impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated financial condition

, with the most significant changes related to the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is

not expected to impact significantly Northern Trust’s consolidated results of operations.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 significantly changes the way impairment of financial instruments is recognized by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of financial instruments. The main provisions of ASU 2016-13 include (1) replacing the “incurred loss” approach under current GAAP with an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost, (2) requiring entities to record an allowance for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount of the investments, as is required by the other-than-temporary-impairment model under current GAAP, and (3) a simplified accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, although early adoption is permitted.

Northern Trust has established a working group across various functions, an overall governance structure, and has finalized a detailed project plan for its implementation efforts.

Further, Northern Trust assessed its current inventory of underlying credit models along with the suitability of these models for the overall expected loss impairment model under ASU 2016-13 and prepared a comprehensive gap analysis. Development activities for new and modified credit loss models have commenced.

Northern Trust continues to evaluate specific application issues and the overall impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08, “Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Securities” (ASU 2017-08), which

amends the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium and shortens the amortization period for the premium to the earliest call date.

ASU 2017-08 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted.

Northern Trust is currently assessing the impact of adoption of ASU 2017-08.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” (ASU 2017-12).

The main provisions of ASU 2017-12 better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships.

ASU 2017-12 eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. Further, ASU 2017-12 eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. ASU 2017-12 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted.

Northern Trust plans to early adopt ASU 2017-12 in the first half of 2018.

Northern Trust currently applies the “shortcut” method of accounting available under GAAP for substantially all fair value hedges and other aspects of Northern Trust’s current hedge accounting program and therefore

ASU 2017-12 is not expected to impact significantly Northern Trust’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations upon adoption.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” (ASU 2018-02).

The amendments in ASU 2018-02 allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

. ASU 2018-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of the amendments in ASU 2018-02 is permitted. The amendments in ASU 2018-02 may be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized.

Northern Trust plans to early adopt ASU 2018-02 in the first quarter of 2018, and expects to reclassify approximately $25 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

Capital expenditures in


included ongoing enhancements to Northern Trust’s software and hardware capabilities, the opening of new offices, and the expansion and renovation of several existing offices. Capital expenditures for


totaled

$472.8 million

, of which

$381.2 million

was for software,

$58.3 million

was for computer hardware,

$27.1 million

was for building and leasehold improvements, and

$6.2 million

was for furnishings. These capital expenditures principally support and enhance Northern Trust’s investment management, asset servicing and asset management capabilities, as well as relationship management and client interaction. Additional capital expenditures committed for systems technology will result in future expense for the depreciation of hardware and amortization of software. Software amortization and


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

depreciation on computer hardware and machinery are charged to equipment and software expense. Depreciation on building and leasehold improvements and on furnishings is charged to occupancy expense and equipment expense, respectively. Capital expenditures for


totaled

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Assets Under Custody/Administration and Assets Under Management

Northern Trust, in the normal course of business, holds assets under custody/administration and management in a fiduciary or agency capacity for its clients. In accordance with GAAP, these assets are not assets of Northern Trust and are not included in its consolidated balance sheets.

Commitments, Letters of Credit and Securities Lent with Indemnification

Northern Trust, in the normal course of business, enters into various types of commitments and issues letters of credit to meet the liquidity and credit enhancement needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these instruments represent the potential credit exposure should the instrument be drawn fully upon and the client default. To control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit, Northern Trust subjects such activities to the same credit quality and monitoring controls as its lending activities. The following table provides details of Northern Trust’s off-balance-sheet financial instruments as of

December 31, 2017

and


.

TABLE 36: SUMMARY OF OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CONTRACT AMOUNTS


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Undrawn commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since a significant portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements. The following table provides information about the industry sector and expiration dates of undrawn commitments to extend credit as of

December 31, 2017

.

TABLE 37: UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT BY INDUSTRY SECTOR

Note: Commercial and Institutional industry sector information is presented on the basis of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

Standby letters of credit obligate Northern Trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the clients are unable to do so. These instruments are primarily issued to support public and private financial commitments, including commercial paper, bond financing, initial margin requirements on futures exchanges and similar transactions. Northern Trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements and in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants. Standby letters of credit of

$3.0 billion

and

$3.8 billion

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, include

$92.5 million

and

$134.2 million

, respectively, of standby letters of credit secured by cash deposits or participated to others. The weighted average maturity of standby letters of credit was


months at

December 31, 2017

and


.

As part of its securities custody activities and at the direction of its clients, Northern Trust lends securities owned by clients to borrowers who are reviewed and approved by the Northern Trust Capital Markets Credit Committee. In connection with these activities, Northern Trust has issued indemnifications to certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrower’s failure to return securities when due, should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral required to be posted. Borrowers are required to collateralize fully securities received with cash or marketable securities. As securities are loaned, collateral is maintained at a minimum of

100%

of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest. The collateral is revalued on a daily basis. The amount of securities loaned subject to indemnification was

$143.6 billion

and

$102.3 billion

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. Because of the credit quality of the


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

borrowers and the requirement to collateralize fully securities borrowed, management believes that the exposure to credit loss from this activity is not significant and no liability was recorded at

December 31, 2017

, or


related to these indemnifications.

Additional information about Northern Trust’s off-balance-sheet financial instruments is included in Note 27, “Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Variable Interest Entities

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) are defined within GAAP as entities which either have a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Investors that finance a VIE through debt or equity interests, or other counterparties that provide other forms of support, such as guarantees, subordinated fee arrangements, or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder, if any, that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the VIE’s primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.

Leveraged Leases.

In leveraged leasing transactions, Northern Trust acts as lessor of the underlying asset subject to the lease and typically funds


-

30%

of the asset’s cost via an equity ownership in a trust with the remaining


-

80%

provided by third-party non-recourse debt holders. In such transactions, the trusts, which are VIEs, are created to provide the lessee use of the property with substantially all of the rights and obligations of ownership. The lessee’s maintenance and operation of the leased property has a direct effect on the fair value of the underlying property, and the lessee also has the ability to increase the benefits it can receive and limit the losses it can suffer by the manner in which it uses the property. As a result, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs given it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs.

Tax Credit Structures.

Northern Trust invests in qualified affordable housing projects and community development entities (collectively, community development projects) that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits. The community development projects are formed as limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which Northern Trust invests as a limited partner/investor member through equity contributions. The economic performance of the community development projects, which are VIEs, is subject to the performance of their underlying investment and their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development projects as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. This power is held by the general partners and managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the VIEs.

Investment Funds.

Northern Trust acts as asset manager for various funds in which clients of Northern Trust are investors. As an asset manager of funds, Northern Trust earns a competitively priced fee that is based on assets managed and varies with each fund’s investment objective. Based on its analysis, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs under GAAP.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity

As the Corporation’s principal subsidiary encompassing all of Northern Trust’s banking activities, the Bank centrally manages liquidity for all U.S. and international banking operations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, including client deposits (institutional and personal) from the C&IS and Wealth Management businesses, wholesale funding from the capital markets, maturities of short-term investments, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure additional funds. While management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity, at

December 31, 2017

, the Bank had over

$32.9 billion

of securities and loans readily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings. The Bank also is active in the U.S. interbank funding market, providing an important source of additional liquidity and low-cost funds. Liquidity supports a variety of activities, including client withdrawals, purchases of securities, net loan growth, and draws on commitments to extend credit. Northern Trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet, with cash and due from banks, deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, short-term money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing

70%

of total assets


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

as of

December 31, 2017

. The market value of unencumbered securities at the Bank, which include those placed at the Federal Reserve discount window, totaled

$39.2 billion

at

December 31, 2017

. The Corporation and the Bank each satisfied the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio requirements during


.

The liquidity of the Corporation is managed separately from that of the Bank. The primary sources of cash for the Corporation are issuances of debt or equity, dividend payments from the Bank and interest earned on investment securities and money market assets. On May 8, 2017, the Corporation issued

$350 million

of

3.375%

fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, due May 8, 2032. The Corporation also received

$525.0 million

of dividends from the Bank in


. Dividends from the Bank are subject to certain restrictions, as discussed in further detail in Note 30, “Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends and Loans or Advances,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

The Corporation’s uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the Corporation’s stockholders; the payment of principal and interest to note holders; repurchases of its common stock; and investments in, or loans to, its subsidiaries. The most significant uses of cash by the Corporation during


were

$523.1 million

of common stock repurchases and

$356.8 million

of common stock dividends.

The Corporation’s liquidity, defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets, was

$1.0 billion

and

$757.0 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. During, and at year-end,


and


, these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the Bank or overnight money market placements, both of which were fully available to the Corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries, as needed. Average liquidity during


and


was

$750.5 million

and

$562.8 million

, respectively. The cash flows of the Corporation are shown in Note 33, “Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation only),” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

A significant source of liquidity for both the Corporation and the Bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally. The credit ratings of the Corporation and the Bank as of

December 31, 2017

, provided below, allow Northern Trust to access capital markets on favorable terms.

TABLE 38: NORTHERN TRUST CREDIT RATINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31,


A significant downgrade in one or more of these ratings could limit Northern Trust’s access to capital markets and/or increase the rates paid for short-term borrowings, including deposits, and future long-term debt issuances. The size of these rate increases would depend on multiple factors, including the extent of the downgrade, Northern Trust’s relative debt rating compared to other financial institutions, current market conditions, and other factors. In addition, as discussed in Note 25, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Northern Trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain credit-risk-related contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare Northern Trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event Northern Trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels. The net maximum amount of these termination payments that Northern Trust could have been required to pay at

December 31, 2017

, was

$187.9 million

. Other than these credit-risk-related contingent derivative counterparty payments, Northern Trust had no long-term debt covenants or other credit-risk-related payments at

December 31, 2017

, that would be triggered by a significant downgrade in its debt ratings.

Regulatory Environment

Northern Trust actively follows regulatory developments and regularly evaluates its liquidity risk management framework against proposed rulemaking and industry best practices in order to comply with applicable regulations and further enhance its liquidity policies. Please refer to “Liquidity Standards” under “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1, “Business,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of applicable liquidity standards.

(4) Northern Trust has elected to pay the net tax liability on deferred foreign earnings in eight installments as allowed under section 965(h) of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Capital Management

One of Northern Trust’s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to merit the confidence of clients, counterparties, creditors, regulators and stockholders. A strong capital position helps Northern Trust execute its strategies and withstand unforeseen adverse developments.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Senior management, with oversight from the Capital Governance Committee and the full Board of Directors, is responsible for capital management and planning. Northern Trust manages its capital on both a total Corporation basis and a legal entity basis. The Capital Committee is responsible for measuring and managing capital metrics against levels set forth within the Capital Policy approved by the Board of Directors. In establishing the metrics related to capital, a variety of factors are taken into consideration, including the unique risk profiles of Northern Trust’s businesses, regulatory requirements, capital levels relative to peers, and the impact on credit ratings.

Capital levels were strengthened in

In accordance with Basel III requirements, capital ratios are calculated using both the standardized and advanced approaches. For each ratio, the lower of the result calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach serves as the effective ratio for purposes of determining capital adequacy. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Corporation’s common stockholders’ equity to total risk-based capital and its risk-based capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. regulatory rules as of

December 31, 2017

and

(1) Risk-weighted assets exclude, as applicable under each regulatory approach, amounts primarily related to goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and net unrealized gains or losses on securities and reflect adjustments for excess allowances for credit losses that have been excluded from Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, if any.

(2) Adjusted average fourth quarter assets exclude amounts primarily related to goodwill, other intangible assets, and net unrealized gains or losses on securities.

(3) Beginning with the first quarter of 2015, advanced approaches banking organizations must calculate and report their supplementary leverage ratio. Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation will be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent.

As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the Corporation’s capital ratios exceeded the minimum requirements for classification as “well-capitalized” under applicable U.S. regulatory requirements. Further information regarding the Corporation’s and the Bank’s capital ratios and the minimum requirements for classification as “well-capitalized” is provided in the


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

As of

December 31, 2017

, the Corporation’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the advanced approaches methodologies would have been

13.3%

on a fully phased-in basis, while the Corporation’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the standardized approach would have been

12.4%

on a fully phased-in basis.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk Management Overview

Northern Trust employs an integrated enterprise risk management framework to support its strategies. The framework provides a methodology to identify, assess, monitor, measure, manage and report both internal and external risks to Northern Trust, and promotes a culture of risk awareness across the organization. Northern Trust’s risk culture encompasses the general awareness, attitude and conduct of employees with respect to risk and the management of risk across all lines of defense within the organization. The key risk categories that are inherent in Northern Trust’s business activities include: credit, operational, fiduciary, compliance, market, liquidity, and strategic risk.

Northern Trust reinforces a culture of effective risk management by defining risk management accountabilities, embedding such accountabilities in performance expectations across the company, training and developing employees and evaluating and rewarding employee performance.

Risk Governance and Oversight Overview

Risk governance is an integral aspect of corporate governance at Northern Trust, and includes clearly defined accountabilities, expectations, internal controls and processes for risk-based decision-making and escalation of issues. The diagram below provides a high-level overview of Northern Trust’s risk governance structure, highlighting the oversight of the Board of Directors and key risk-related committees.

TABLE 41: RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

The Board of Directors provides oversight of risk management directly and through certain of its committees: the Audit Committee, the Business Risk Committee, the Capital Governance Committee and the Compensation and Benefits Committee. The Board of Directors approves Northern Trust’s enterprise risk management framework and Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. The Business Risk Committee assumes primary responsibility and oversight with respect to credit risk, operational risk, fiduciary risk, compliance risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and strategic risk. The Audit Committee provides oversight with respect to financial reporting and legal risk, while the Compensation and Benefits Committee oversees the development and operation of Northern Trust’s incentive compensation program. The Compensation and Benefits Committee annually reviews management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the design and performance of Northern Trust’s incentive compensation arrangements and practices in providing incentives that are consistent with Northern Trust’s safety and soundness. This assessment includes an evaluation of whether Northern Trust’s incentive compensation arrangements and practices discourage inappropriate risk-taking behavior by participants. The Capital Governance Committee of the Board assists the Board in discharging its oversight duties with respect to capital management and planning activities. Among other responsibilities, the Capital Governance Committee oversees Northern Trust’s capital adequacy assessments, forecasting, and stress testing processes and activities, including the annual CCAR exercise, and challenges management, as appropriate, on various elements of such processes and activities. Accordingly, the Capital Governance Committee provides oversight with respect to Northern Trust’s linkage of material risks to the capital adequacy assessment process.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) oversees Northern Trust’s management of risk, promotes risk awareness and fosters a proactive risk management environment wherein risks inherent in the business strategy are identified, understood, appropriately monitored and mitigated. The CRO reports directly to the Business Risk Committee and the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer. The CRO regularly advises the Business Risk Committee and reports to the Committee at least quarterly on risk exposures, risk management deficiencies and emerging risks. In accordance with the enterprise risk management framework, the executive risk management team of Northern Trust, together with the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Capital Management Officer, General Counsel and General Auditor, meets as the Global Enterprise Risk Committee (GERC) to provide executive management oversight and guidance with respect to the management of the categories of risk within Northern Trust. Among other risk management responsibilities, GERC receives reports or recommendations from senior risk committees that are responsible for the management of risk, and from time to time may delegate responsibility to such committees for risk issues. Senior risk committees include:

The Credit Risk Committee (CRC)

establishes and monitors credit-related policies and practices throughout Northern Trust and promotes their uniform application.

The Operational Risk Committee (ORC)

provides independent oversight and is responsible for setting the Corporate Operational Risk Management Policy and developing the operational risk management framework and programs that support the coordination of operational risk activities.

The Fiduciary Risk Committee (FRC)

is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities.

The Compliance & Ethics Oversight Committee (CEOC)

provides oversight and direction with respect to compliance policies, implementation of the compliance and ethics program, and the coordination of regulatory compliance initiatives across the Corporation.

The Market & Liquidity Risk Committee (MLRC)

oversees activities relating to the management of market and liquidity risks by facilitating a focused review of market and liquidity risk exposures and providing rigorous challenge of related policies, key assumptions, and practices.

The Model Risk Oversight Committee (MROC)

is responsible for providing management attention, direction, and oversight of the model risk management framework and model risk within Northern Trust.

In addition to the aforementioned committees, Northern Trust deploys business and regional risk committees that also report into GERC.

Risk Identification and Risk Management Process

As part of the integrated enterprise risk framework, Northern Trust has established key risk identification and risk management processes, embedded within its businesses to enable prudent risk-taking behavior. Integral to the risk framework are Northern Trust’s processes for definition and communication of acceptable risk appetite and reporting against risk appetite, dynamic assessment of risk against its strategic and business objectives, and a “three lines of defense” operating model. Northern Trust defines the organization’s risk appetite as the amount and types of risk that it is willing to assume in its exposures and business activities to achieve its strategic and financial objectives. Northern Trust manages its business activities consistent with the Corporate Risk Appetite Statement, in which specific guidelines are detailed for each key risk category. Northern Trust’s Corporate Risk Appetite Statement reflects the expectation that risk is consciously considered as part of day-to-day activities and strategic decisions. Northern Trust’s risk assessment process, aligned with this expectation, consists of a series of programs that identify, measure, manage, and report risks in line with risk appetite and guidelines. A common risk language used across Northern Trust supports risk identification processes and consistent identification of risk, designation of material risks, and grouping of risks into risk themes for effective analysis, oversight, and management of Northern Trust’s aggregate risk profile.

Northern Trust maintains a “three lines of defense” operating model to embed a robust risk management capability within its businesses. The model, used to communicate risk management expectations across the organization, contains three roles, each a complimentary level of risk management accountability. Within this operating model, Northern Trust’s businesses are the first line of defense for protecting it against the risks inherent in its businesses and are supported by dedicated business risk management teams. The Risk Management function, the second line of defense, sets the direction

for Northern Trust’s risk management activities and provides aggregate risk oversight and reporting in support of risk governance. Audit Services, the third line of defense, provides independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the integrated enterprise risk framework.

Risk Control

Risk Control is an internal, independent review function within the Risk Management function. Risk Control is managed by the Chief Risk Control Officer and is comprised of Model Risk Management, Credit Review, Global Compliance Testing and Basel Independent Verification groups, each with its own risk focus and oversight. Model Risk Management is responsible for the implementation and management of the enterprise-wide model risk framework and independently validating new models and reviewing and re-validating existing models. Credit Review provides an independent, ongoing assessment of credit exposure and related credit risk management processes across Northern Trust. Global Compliance Testing evaluates the effectiveness of procedures and controls designed to comply with relevant laws and regulations, as well as corresponding Northern Trust policies governing regulatory compliance activities. Lastly, Basel Independent Verification promotes rigor and accuracy in Northern Trust’s ongoing compliance with Basel III requirements and adherence to Enhanced Prudential Standards, including Liquidity Stress Testing. The Business Risk Committee oversees Risk Control generally as well as each of these groups.

Audit Services

Audit Services is an independent control function that assesses and validates controls within Northern Trust’s enterprise risk management framework. Audit Services is managed by the General Auditor with oversight from the Audit Committee. Audit Services tests the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls associated with the advanced systems on an ongoing basis and reports the results of these audits directly to the Audit Committee. Audit Services includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. The General Auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee and the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk to interest income or principal from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to perform on an obligation.

Credit Risk Overview

Credit risk is inherent in many of Northern Trust’s activities. A significant component of credit risk relates to loans, leases, securities, and counterparty-related exposures. Northern Trust’s loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large U.S. financial institutions in that Northern Trust is generally:

•

not an originator of loan products to be sold into a secondary market or to be bundled into asset securitizations;

•

not an agent bank or syndicator of loans, where risk management is achieved post-close through the sale of participations; and

•

not a participant in leveraged financial transactions, such as project finance, private-equity-originated acquisition financing or hedge fund leveraging.

Credit Risk Framework and Governance

The Credit Risk Management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and, while independent of the businesses, it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive management of credit risk. To monitor and control credit risk, the Credit Risk Management function maintains a framework that consists of policies, standards, and practices designed to promote a conservative credit culture. This function also monitors adherence to corporate policies, standards, and external regulations.

The Credit Risk Management function provides a system of checks and balances for Northern Trust’s diverse credit-related activities by monitoring these activities and practices and promoting their uniform application throughout Northern Trust.

The credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit. Individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities. Credit requests exceeding individual authority because of amount, rating, term or other conditions, are referred to the relevant Group Credit Approval Committee. Credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the Senior Credit Committee. The Capital Markets Credit Committee has sole credit authority for the approval, modification, or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The CRC establishes and monitors credit-related policies and practices throughout Northern Trust and promotes their uniform application. The Chief Credit Officer reports directly to the CRO and chairs the CRC. Independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework also is provided by Risk Control.

Credit Risk Measurement

An integral component of credit risk measurement is Northern Trust’s internal risk rating system. Northern Trust’s internal risk rating system enables identification, measurement, approval and monitoring of credit risk. Calculations include entity-specific information about the obligor’s or counterparty’s probability of default and exposure-specific information about loss given default, exposure at default and maturity.

The Credit Risk Management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal risk-rating system. Independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of Risk Control.

Loans and Other Extensions of Credit

A significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio, including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. These contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in the “Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements” section and in Note 27, “Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments,” to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

As part of Northern Trust’s credit processes, the Credit Risk Management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant and/or weaker-rated credits. This approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems. An integral part of the Credit Risk Management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits, if any, need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off. Northern Trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for adversely classified credit exposures that includes all nonperforming credits as well as other loans with elevated risk of default. Independent from the Credit Risk Management function, Credit Review undertakes both on-site and off-site file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of management’s implementation of the Credit Risk Management’s requirements.

Counterparty Credit Risk

Counterparty credit risk for Northern Trust primarily arises from a variety of funding, treasury, trading and custody-related activities, including over-the-counter (OTC) currency and interest rate derivatives, and from indemnified securities lending transactions. Credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor.

To calculate exposure, Northern Trust treats repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repo-style transactions. Foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as OTC derivatives. The exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure, including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants, is determined based on operational requirements, the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity.

Credit Risk Mitigation

Northern Trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for client-related credit exposures. However, Northern Trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure. Northern Trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories.

Physical and Financial Collateral:

Northern Trust’s primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral. Residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property. In cases where loans to commercial or certain Wealth Management clients are secured by marketable securities, the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies.

Netting:

On-balance-sheet netting is employed on a limited basis. Netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements. Northern Trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time.

Guarantees:

Personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect Northern Trust’s claims relative to other creditors. Northern Trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure, such as in any single (or small number of related) obligor/counterparty, loan type, industry, geography, country or risk mitigant. Processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits.

Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, human factors and systems, or from external events.

Operational Risk Overview

Operational risk is inherent in each of Northern Trust’s businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems, operating problems, product design and delivery difficulties, potential legal actions, or other catastrophes to result in losses.

Operational risk includes compliance, fiduciary and legal risks, which under the Corporation’s risk structure are governed and managed explicitly.

Operational Risk Framework and Governance

To monitor and control operational risk, Northern Trust maintains a framework consisting of risk management policies, programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment and maintain the Corporation’s operational risk profile and losses within approved risk appetites and guidelines. The framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that impact risk and drive action to reduce future loss events. The Operational Risk Management function is responsible for defining the operational risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across Northern Trust. It is the responsibility of each business to implement the enterprise-wide operational risk framework and business-specific risk management programs to identify, monitor, measure, and manage operational risk and mitigate Northern Trust’s exposure to loss. Several key programs support the operational risk framework, including:

•

Loss Event Data Program

- a program that collects internal and external loss data for use in monitoring operational risk exposure, various business analyses and a Basel Advanced Management Approach (AMA) capital quantification.

•

Risk and Control Self-Assessment

- a structured risk management process used by Northern Trust’s businesses to analyze the risks that are present in their respective business environments, processes and activities and to assess the adequacy of associated internal controls.

•

Operational Risk Scenario Analysis

- a systematic process of obtaining expert opinions from business managers and risk management experts to derive reasoned assessments of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss impact of plausible high-severity operational losses.

•

Product and Process Risk Management Program

- a program used for evaluating and managing risks associated with the introduction of new and modified noncredit products and services, significant changes to operating processes, and related significant loss events.

•

Outsourcing Risk Management Program

- a program that provides processes for appropriate risk assessment, measurement, monitoring and management of outsourced technology and business process outsourcing.

•

Information Security and Technology Risk Management

- a program that communicates and implements compliance and risk management processes and controls to address information security, including cyber threats and technology risks to the organization.

•

Significant New Business Opportunity

- a program that assesses the resource requirements, impact on systems and controls, and other risk factors prior to taking on significant new business.

•

Business Continuity Management Program

- a program designed to minimize business impact and support the resumption of mission critical functions for clients following an incident.

•

Physical Security

- a program that provides for the safety of Northern Trust partners, clients, and visitors worldwide.

•

Insurance Management Program

- a program designed to reduce the monetary impact of certain operational loss events.

As discussed in Risk Control, Model Risk Management also is part of the operational risk framework.

The ORC is responsible for overseeing the activities of Northern Trust related to the management of operational risk including establishing the Corporate Operational Risk Policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs. This committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks. The


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

purpose of this committee is to provide executive management’s insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks.

Operational Risk Measurement

Northern Trust utilizes the AMA capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the Corporation and applicable U.S. banking subsidiaries. Northern Trust’s AMA capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the Loss Event Data, Risk and Control Self-Assessment and Operational Risk Scenario Analysis programs to derive required capital. Business environment factor information is used to estimate loss frequency. The AMA capital quantification process uses a Loss Distribution Approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 99.9

th

percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a one-year time horizon.

Information Security and Technology Management

Effective management of risks related to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is crucial in an environment of increasing cyber threat and requires a structured approach to establish and communicate expectations and required practices. Northern Trust’s approach to information security begins at a governance level with an organizational structure that reflects support from executive management and includes risk committees comprised of members from across Northern Trust’s businesses. In addition to a strong governance process, internal controls and risk management practices are designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to Northern Trust’s overall risk appetite and the inherent risk in the markets in which Northern Trust operates. Northern Trust employees are responsible for promoting information security as well as adhering to applicable policies and standards and other means provided to them to safeguard electronic information and business systems within their care. Training and awareness programs to educate employees on information security are on-going and include multiple approaches such as mandatory computer-based training, phishing simulations, and the designation of individuals as Information Security and Privacy Champions within the businesses. In cases where Northern Trust relies on vendors to perform services, controls are routinely reviewed for alignment with industry standards and their ability to protect information. Any findings identified are remediated following a risk-based approach.

In addition to the various information security controls managed and monitored within the organization, Northern Trust uses external third-party security teams on a regular basis to assess effectiveness. These teams perform security program maturity assessments, penetration tests, security assessments and reviews of Northern Trust’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks such as spear phishing. Northern Trust operates a global security operations center for threat identification and response. This center aggregates security threat information from systems and platforms across the businesses, and alerts the organization in accordance with its documented Cyber Incident Response Plan.

The Cyber Incident Response Plan is used to respond to cybersecurity incidents. A cybersecurity incident is defined as an incident caused by damaging activity, which requires actions to prevent and respond to disruptions, denials, compromises or exfiltration that impact the confidentiality, integrity and availably of the assets of Northern Trust or its clients. The plan provides a streamlined approach that can be invoked rapidly to address matters that raise enterprise concern and to communicate impact, actions and status to senior management, including the Chief Information Security Officer, and appropriate stakeholders. The plan is designed to work with enterprise-level response plans and is tested routinely.

Business Resiliency and Continuity Management

Northern Trust’s business resiliency approach encompasses business continuity and disaster recovery processes enterprise-wide (including staff, technology and facilities) to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption Northern Trust resumes mission-critical business and economic functions and fulfills all regulatory and legal requirements.

Northern Trust’s business resiliency mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security, resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers, a highly redundant global network, robust network security, resiliency centers that offer alternative workstations, and transfer of work and work-from-home programs that provide further capability.

All of Northern Trust’s businesses are required to risk-assess regularly their critical functions and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements (people, systems, vendor relationships and other assets), arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards. The strength of the business continuity programs of all critical third-party vendors to Northern Trust are reviewed on a regular basis. All of Northern Trust’s businesses test their plans at least annually.

The ORC annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the Business Risk Committee.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Fiduciary Risk

Fiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure, in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients’ fiduciary accounts: i) to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws; or ii) to properly discharge fiduciary duties. Fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction, type of relationship and governing document.

Fiduciary Risk Overview

The fiduciary risk management framework identifies, assesses, measures, monitors and reports on fiduciary risk matters deemed significant. Fiduciary risk is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify, understand and keep such risk at levels consistent with the organization’s overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each relationship for which Northern Trust serves in a fiduciary capacity. Each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite level.

Fiduciary Risk Framework and Governance

The FRC is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities to identify, monitor, manage and report on fiduciary risk. In addition, the FRC serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization.

Compliance Risk

Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to Northern Trust. Compliance risk includes the following two subcategories:

•

Regulatory Risk - risk arising from failure to comply with prudential and conduct of business or other regulatory requirements.

•

Financial Crime Risk - risk arising from financial crime (e.g., money laundering, sanctions violations, fraud, insider dealing, theft, etc.) in relation to the products, services, or accounts of the institution, its clients, or others associated with the same.

Compliance Risk Framework and Governance

The compliance risk management framework identifies, assesses, controls, measures, monitors and reports on compliance risk. The framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur. The framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a Compliance and Ethics Program approved by the Business Risk Committee.

Each business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the Compliance and Ethics Program and specific compliance policies within their respective businesses. Each business is responsible for its respective employees’ compliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with Northern Trust’s Compliance and Ethics Program.

The CEOC establishes and monitors adherence to Northern Trust’s Compliance and Ethics Program. The Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer reports to the Business Risk Committee as appropriate and chairs the CEOC.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due, because of firm-specific or market-wide events.

Liquidity Risk Overview

Northern Trust maintains a strong liquidity position and conservative liquidity risk profile. Northern Trust’s balance sheet is liability-driven. That is, the main driver of balance sheet changes comes from changing levels of client deposits, which are generally related to the level of global custody assets serviced and commercial and personal deposits. This liability-driven business model differs from a typical asset-driven business model, where increased levels of deposits and wholesale borrowings are required to support, for example, increased levels of lending for execution of the organization’s investment strategy. Northern Trust’s balance sheet generally consists of high-quality assets with relatively short durations, resulting in low liquidity risk.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Liquidity Risk Framework and Governance

Northern Trust maintains a liquidity risk framework consisting of risk management policies, and practices to keep its risk profile within the Board-approved Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. All liquidity risk activities are overseen by the Risk Management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.

Exposure limits for liquidity risk are set by the Board and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. Limits are monitored based on measures such as the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the liquidity stress-testing buffer across a range of time horizons.

The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as cash flows and stress test results. The MLRC provides second line oversight and is responsible for approving sub-policies and procedures, establishing and monitoring risk metrics, and approving methodologies and key assumptions that drive liquidity risk measurement.

Liquidity Risk Analysis, Monitoring, and Reporting

Liquidity risk is analyzed and monitored in order to ensure compliance with the approved risk appetite. Various liquidity analysis and monitoring activities are employed by Northern Trust to understand better the nature and sources of its liquidity risks, including: liquidity stress testing, liquidity metric monitoring, collateral management, intraday management, cash flow projections, operational deposit assessments, liquid asset buffer measurement, funds transfer pricing, and contingency funding planning.

The liquidity risk management process is supported through management and regulatory reporting. Both Northern Trust’s Treasury and Market and Liquidity Risk Management functions produce management reports using the outputs from the liquidity assessment, monitoring, and analysis, enabling oversight bodies to make informed decisions and support management of risk within the approved risk appetite. Holistic liquidity metrics such as LCR and internal liquidity stress testing are actively monitored, along with a suite of other metrics that provide early warning indicators of changes in the risk profile.

Market Risk

There are two types of market risk, interest rate risk and trading risk. Interest rate risk is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity. Trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions.

Market Risk Framework and Governance

Northern Trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the Board-approved Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. All market risk activities are overseen by the Risk Management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.

Exposure limits for market risk are set by the Board and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. Limits are monitored based on measures such as sensitivity of net interest income (NII), sensitivity of market value of equity (MVE), and Value-at-Risk (VaR) across a range of time horizons.

ALCO provides first line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as stress test results. The MLRC provides second line oversight and is responsible for approving sub-policies and procedures, establishing and monitoring risk metrics, and approving methodologies and key assumptions that drive market risk measurement.

Interest Rate Risk Overview

Interest rate risk is the risk to NII, associated with the balance sheet, or MVE due to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on NII depending on the positioning of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet instruments. Changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet positions, which indirectly impact the MVE. To mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities (adjusted for hedges) are highly correlated, which allows Northern Trust’s interest-bearing assets and liabilities to contribute to NII even in periods of volatile interest rates.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

There are four commonly recognized types of structured interest rate risk:

•

repricing, which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities;

•

yield curve, which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve;

•

basis, which arises from imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics; and

•

behavioral characteristics embedded optionality, which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes.

Interest Rate Risk Analysis, Monitoring, and Reporting

Northern Trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: NII and MVE sensitivity. NII sensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on NII. MVE sensitivity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on MVE as of the period-end balance sheet. Both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances.

Northern Trust limits aggregate interest rate risk (as measured by the NII sensitivity and MVE sensitivity simulation techniques) to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite. A variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including:

•

purchase of securities;

•

sale of securities that are classified as available for sale;

•

issuance of senior notes and subordinated notes;

•

collateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank;

•

placing and taking Eurodollar time deposits; and

•

hedges with various types of derivative financial instruments.

NII Sensitivity

The modeling of NII sensitivity incorporates on-balance-sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. Northern Trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e. change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e. twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e. basis risk).

The NII sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate NII sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions; therefore, there could be a change in NII sensitivity to the extent that actual behavior differs from that assumed. The following key assumptions are incorporated into the NII simulation:

•

the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment;

•

prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions;

•

cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor;

•

nonmaturity deposit pricing and lives are projected based on Northern Trust’s actual historical patterns and management judgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies/or judgment; and

•

new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices.


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table shows the estimated NII impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point upward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates. Each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period. Given the low level of interest rates, the simulation of NII for rates 100 and 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results.

TABLE 42: NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2017

The NII sensitivity analysis does not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movement. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. NII sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided. Further, the estimated impacts presented above are not directly comparable to those presented in prior periods due to changes to client deposit pricing assumptions and the implementation of interest rate risk model enhancements.

MVE Sensitivity

MVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities, net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items. The potential effect of interest rate changes on MVE is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit. Northern Trust uses current market rates (and the future rates implied by these market rates) as the base case and measures MVE sensitivity under various rate scenarios. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e. twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e. basis risk).

The MVE sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate MVE sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions; therefore, there could be a change in MVE sensitivity to the extent that actual behavior differs from the incorporated assumptions. Many of the assumptions that apply to NII sensitivity also apply to MVE sensitivity simulations, with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the MVE simulation:

•

the present value of nonmaturity deposits are estimated using remaining lives, which are based on a combination of Northern Trust’s actual historical runoff patterns and management judgment - some balances are assumed to be core and have longer lives while other balances are assumed to be temporary and have comparatively shorter lives; and

•

the present values of most noninterest-related balances (such as receivables, equipment, and payables) are the same as their book values.

The following table shows the estimated impact on MVE of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up from current market implied forward rates. Given the low level of interest rates and assumed interest rate floors as rates approach zero, the simulation of MVE for rates 100 or 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results.

TABLE 43: MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY SENSITIVITY AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2017


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The MVE simulations do not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movements. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. MVE sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided. Further, the estimated impacts presented above are not directly comparable to those presented in prior periods due to changes to client deposit pricing assumptions and the implementation of interest rate risk model enhancements.

During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, Northern Trust did not exceed its NII sensitivity limits or its MVE sensitivity limits.

Foreign Currency Risk Overview

Northern Trust's balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries, and future non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expense. To manage currency exposures on the balance sheet, Northern Trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency. If those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet, Northern Trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure. Foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce Northern Trust’s currency exposure to future non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expense.

In addition, Northern Trust provides foreign exchange services to clients. Most of these services are provided in connection with Northern Trust’s growing global custody business. In the normal course of business Northern Trust also engages in trading of non-U.S. currencies for its own account. Both activities are considered trading activities. The primary market risk associated with global foreign exchange trading activities is foreign exchange risk.

Foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other in amount, or offset each other over different time periods.

Foreign Currency Risk Measurement

Northern Trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-U.S. currency positions using a VaR model and applying the historical simulation methodology. This statistical model provides estimates, based on a variety of high confidence levels, of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in non-U.S. currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days. The model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies. VaR is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio.

VaR measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions from Northern Trust’s trading systems each day. Data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies. The Risk Management function monitors on a daily basis VaR model inputs and outputs for reasonableness.

Foreign Currency Risk Monitoring, Reporting and Analysis

Northern Trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange VaR measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs. Variations include different methodologies (historical, variance-covariance and Monte Carlo), equally weighted and exponentially weighted volatilities, horizons of one day and ten days, confidence levels ranging from 95% to 99.95% and look back periods of one year and four years. Those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on Northern Trust’s market risks.

Automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers. The Risk Management function also reviews and reports several variations of the VaR measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk.

The table below presents the levels of total regulatory VaR and its subcomponents for global foreign currency in the years indicated below, based on the historical simulation methodology, a 99% confidence level, a one-day horizon and equally weighted volatility. The total VaR for foreign currency is typically less than the sum of its two components due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents.

Other Nonmaterial Trading Activities

Market risk associated with other trading activities is negligible. Northern Trust’s broker-dealer, Northern Trust Securities, Inc., maintains a small portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes which averaged

$0.8 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

.

Northern Trust is also party to interest rate derivative contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps entered into to meet clients’ interest rate management needs, but also including a small number of caps, floors, and swaptions (an option to enter into an interest rate swap). All interest rate derivative transactions are executed by the Treasury department. When Northern Trust enters into client transactions, its practice is to mitigate the resulting market risk with offsetting interbank derivative transactions with matching terms and maturities.

Strategic Risk

Strategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy ineffective or unachievable. The consequences of strategic risk can be diminished long-term earnings and capital, as well as reputational damage to the firm. Strategic risk includes the following three subcategories:

•

Macroeconomic and geopolitical risk, which centers on events or themes that would have a significant, detrimental impact on financial markets, and by extension, financial services firms. Episodes of this kind would tend to have general, as opposed to idiosyncratic, consequences.

•

Business risk, which arises from change in the following areas:

•

Internal: situations within Northern Trust that threaten business continuity, profitability, or the achievement of strategic objectives

•

Secular: behavioral or technological change that affects clients and renders a Northern Trust process or service obsolete

•

Competitive: new products or shifts in the industry landscape that challenge Northern Trust’s performance

•

Regulatory: changes to prudential or fiscal policy that have an adverse impact on Northern Trust or its clients

•

Reputation risk, which is a residual risk which arises from negative perception on the part of clients, counterparties, stockholders, investors, debt holders, market analysts, regulators, staff, or other relevant parties that adversely affects Northern Trust’s ability to conduct its businesses or to access sources of funding.

Strategic Risk Framework and Governance

Northern Trust maintains a framework that consists of risk management policies, frameworks and practices designed to identify, analyze, and limit, where possible, the sources and negative consequences of strategic risk. The Strategic Risk Management function is responsible for defining the strategic risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across Northern Trust. In furtherance of this effort, Northern Trust has established governance and strategic planning processes for review and effective challenge, where appropriate, of business strategy and new products.

In addition, Northern Trust maintains a Global Stress Testing Framework which governs stress testing exercises conducted by Northern Trust’s businesses and enterprise tabletop exercises that examine the consequences of macroeconomic or geopolitical shocks. Northern Trust also maintains the Global Emergency Response Plan, which guides its reaction to adverse external events if they arise.

Both GERC and the Business Risk Committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods, guidelines and policies by which Northern Trust monitors and controls strategic risk.

RECONCILIATION TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT

The following table presents a reconciliation of interest income, net interest income, net interest margin, and total revenue prepared in accordance with GAAP to such measures on an FTE basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and reporting practices prescribed for the banking industry. A description of the more significant accounting policies follows.

A. Basis of Presentation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Northern Trust Company (Bank), and various other wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation and Bank. Throughout the notes, the term “Northern Trust” refers to the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated statements of income include results of acquired subsidiaries from the dates of acquisition. Certain prior-year balances have been reclassified consistent with the current-year’s presentation.

B. Nature of Operations.

The Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Bank is an Illinois banking corporation headquartered in Chicago and the Corporation’s principal subsidiary. The Corporation conducts business in the United States (U.S.) and internationally through various U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, including the Bank.

Northern Trust generates the majority of its revenue from its

two

client-focused reporting segments: Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C&IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business.

C&IS is a leading global provider of asset servicing and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors around the globe. Asset servicing and related services encompass a full range of capabilities including but not limited to: global custody; fund administration; investment operations outsourcing; investment management; investment risk and analytical services; employee benefit services; securities lending; foreign exchange; treasury management; brokerage services; transition management services; banking and cash management. Client relationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support from locations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.

Wealth Management focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. The business also includes the Global Family Office, which provides customized services to meet the complex financial needs of individuals and family offices in the U.S. and throughout the world with assets typically exceeding

$200 million

. In supporting these targeted segments, Wealth Management provides trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services; financial consulting; guardianship and estate administration; family business consulting; family financial education; brokerage services; and private and business banking. Wealth Management services are delivered by multidisciplinary teams through a network of offices in


U.S. states and Washington, D.C., as well as offices in London, Guernsey, and Abu Dhabi.

C. Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

D. Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Translation.

Asset and liability accounts denominated in nonfunctional currencies are remeasured into functional currencies at period-end rates of exchange, except for certain balance sheet items including buildings and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Results from remeasurement of asset and liability accounts are reported in other operating income as currency translation gains (losses), net. Income and expense accounts are remeasured at period-average rates of exchange.

Asset and liability accounts of entities with functional currencies that are not the U.S. dollar are translated at period-end rates of exchange. Income and expense accounts are translated at period-average rates of exchange. Translation adjustments, net of applicable taxes, are reported directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), a component of stockholders’ equity.

E. Securities.

Securities Available for Sale

are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses credited or charged, net of the tax effect, to AOCI. Realized gains and losses on securities available for sale are determined on a specific identification basis and are reported within other security gains (losses), net, in the consolidated statements of


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

income. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of discount.

Securities Held to Maturity

consist of debt securities that management intends to, and Northern Trust has the ability to, hold until maturity. Such securities are reported at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of discount.

Securities Held for Trading

are stated at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities held for trading are reported in the consolidated statements of income within security commissions and trading income.

Nonmarketable Securities

primarily consist of Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and community development investments, each of which are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock are reported at cost, which represents redemption value. Community development investments are typically reported at amortized cost. Those community development investments that are designed to generate a return primarily through realization of tax credits and other tax benefits, which are discussed in further detail in Note 28, “Variable Interest Entities,” are reported at amortized cost using the effective yield method or proportional amortization method and amortized over the lives of the related tax credits and other tax benefits.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment (OTTI).

A security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security’s amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the credit loss) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security’s amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or more-likely-than-not will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. If OTTI exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of credit loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and it is more-likely-than-not that it will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in AOCI, net of applicable taxes. Otherwise, the entire difference between fair value and amortized cost is charged to earnings.

F. Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until the repurchase.

G. Derivative Financial Instruments.

Northern Trust is a party to various derivative instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients; as part of its trading activity for its own account; and as part of its risk management activities. These instruments include foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts, total return swap contracts and credit default swap contracts. Derivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value within other assets and other liabilities. Derivative asset and liability positions with the same counterparty are reflected on a net basis on the consolidated balance sheets in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist. Derivative assets and liabilities are further reduced by cash collateral received from, and deposited with, derivative counterparties. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative in the consolidated statements of income depends on whether or not the contract has been designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting under GAAP. Derivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated statements of cash flows within the line item, “other operating activities, net,” except for net investment hedges which are recorded within “other investing activities, net”.

Changes in the fair value of client-related and trading derivative instruments, which are not designated hedges under GAAP, are recognized currently in either foreign exchange trading income or security commissions and trading income. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes but not designated as hedges are recognized currently in other operating income. Certain derivative instruments used by Northern Trust to manage risk are formally designated and qualify for hedge accounting as fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedges.

Derivatives designated as fair value hedges are used to limit Northern Trust’s exposure to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recognized currently in income. For substantially all fair value hedges, Northern Trust applies the “shortcut” method of accounting, available under GAAP, which assumes there is no ineffectiveness in a hedge. As a result, changes recorded in the fair value of the hedged item are equal to the offsetting gain or loss on the derivative and are reflected in the same line item. For fair value hedges that do not qualify for the “shortcut” method of accounting, Northern Trust utilizes regression analysis, a “long-haul” method of


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

accounting, in assessing whether these hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and quarterly thereafter. Ineffectiveness resulting from fair value hedges is recorded in either interest income or interest expense.

Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are used to minimize the variability in cash flows of earning assets or forecasted transactions caused by movements in interest or foreign exchange rates. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of such derivatives is recognized in AOCI, a component of stockholders’ equity, and there is no change to the accounting for the hedged item. Balances in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings. Northern Trust applies the “shortcut” method of accounting for cash flow hedges of certain available for sale investment securities. For cash flow hedges of certain other available for sale investment securities, foreign currency denominated investment securities, and forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions, Northern Trust closely matches all terms of the hedged item and hedging derivative at inception and on an ongoing basis which limits hedge ineffectiveness. For cash flow hedges of available for sale investment securities, to the extent all terms are not perfectly matched, effectiveness is assessed using regression analysis and any ineffectiveness is measured using the hypothetical derivative method. For cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions and investment securities, to the extent all terms are not perfectly matched, effectiveness is assessed using the dollar-offset method and any ineffectiveness is measured using the hypothetical derivative method. Any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in earnings.

Foreign exchange contracts and qualifying non-derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are used to minimize Northern Trust’s exposure to variability in the foreign currency translation of net investments in non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in AOCI consistent with the related translation gains and losses of the hedged net investment. For net investment hedges, all critical terms of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are matched at inception and on an ongoing basis to minimize the risk of hedge ineffectiveness. To the extent all terms are not perfectly matched, any ineffectiveness is measured using the hypothetical derivative method. Ineffectiveness resulting from net investment hedges is recorded in other operating income. Amounts recorded in AOCI are reclassified to earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of an investment in a non-U.S. branch or subsidiary.

Fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges are designated and formally documented as such contemporaneous with the transaction. The formal documentation describes the hedge relationship and identifies the hedging instruments and hedged items. Included in the documentation is a discussion of the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking such hedges, the nature of the risk being hedged, a description of the method for assessing hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis, as well as the method that will be used to measure hedge ineffectiveness. For hedges that do not qualify for the “shortcut” or the critical terms match methods of accounting, a formal assessment is performed on a calendar quarter basis to verify that derivatives used in hedging transactions continue to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge accounting is discontinued if a derivative ceases to be highly effective, matures, is terminated or sold, if a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, or if Northern Trust removes the derivative’s hedge designation. Subsequent gains and losses on these derivatives are included in foreign exchange trading income or security commissions and trading income. For discontinued cash flow hedges, the accumulated gain or loss on the derivative remains in AOCI and is reclassified to earnings in the period in which the previously hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings or is no longer probable of occurring. For discontinued fair value hedges, the previously hedged asset or liability ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value. Previous adjustments to the hedged item are amortized over the remaining life of the hedged item.

H. Loans and Leases.

Loans and leases are recognized assets that represent a contractual right to receive money either on demand or on fixed or determinable dates. Loans and leases are disaggregated for disclosure purposes by portfolio segment (segment) and by class. Northern Trust has defined its segments as commercial and personal. A class of loans and leases is a subset of a segment, the components of which has similar risk characteristics, measurement attributes, or risk monitoring methods. The classes within the commercial segment have been defined as commercial and institutional, commercial real estate, lease financing, net, non-U.S. and other. The classes within the personal segment have been defined as residential real estate, private client and other.

Loan Classification.

Loans that are held for investment are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income. Loans classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Undrawn commitments relating to loans that are not held for sale are recorded in other liabilities and are carried at the amount of unamortized fees with an allowance for credit loss liability recognized for any estimated probable losses.

Recognition of Income.

Interest income on loans is recorded on an accrual basis unless, in the opinion of management, there is a question as to the ability of the debtor to meet the terms of the loan agreement, or interest or principal is more than

90 days

contractually past due and the loan is not well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans meeting such criteria are classified as nonperforming and interest income is recorded on a cash basis. Past due status


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

is based on how long since the contractual due date a principal or interest payment has been past due. For disclosure purposes, loans that are

29 days

past due or less are reported as current. At the time a loan is determined to be nonperforming, interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income in the current period. Interest collected on nonperforming loans is applied to principal unless, in the opinion of management, collectability of principal is not in doubt. Management’s assessment of indicators of loan and lease collectability, and its policies relative to the recognition of interest income, including the suspension and subsequent resumption of income recognition, do not meaningfully vary between loan and lease classes. Nonperforming loans are returned to performing status when factors indicating doubtful collectability no longer exist. Factors considered in returning a loan to performing status are consistent across all classes of loans and leases and, in accordance with regulatory guidance, relate primarily to expected payment performance. A loan is eligible to be returned to performing status when: (i) no principal or interest that is due is unpaid and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected or (ii) the loan has otherwise become well-secured (possessing realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt, including accrued interest, in full) and is in the process of collection (through action reasonably expected to result in debt repayment or restoration to a current status in the near future). A loan that has not been brought fully current may be restored to performing status provided there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally a minimum of

six

payment periods) by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms, and Northern Trust is reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period of time. Additionally, a loan that has been formally restructured so as to be reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to its modified terms may be returned to accrual status, provided there was a well-documented credit evaluation of the borrower’s financial condition and prospects of repayment under the revised terms, and there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally a minimum of

six

payment periods) under the revised terms.

Impaired Loans.

A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, management determines that it is probable that Northern Trust will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are identified through ongoing credit management and risk rating processes, including the formal review of past due and watch list credits. Payment performance and delinquency status are critical factors in identifying impairment for all loans and leases, particularly those within the residential real estate, private client and personal-other classes. Other key factors considered in identifying impairment of loans and leases within the commercial and institutional, lease financing, net, non-U.S., and commercial-other classes relate to the borrower’s ability to perform under the terms of the obligation as measured through the assessment of future cash flows, including consideration of collateral value, market value, and other factors. A loan is also considered to be impaired if its terms have been modified as a concession by Northern Trust or a bankruptcy court resulting from the debtor’s financial difficulties, referred to as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). All TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the calendar year of their restructuring. In subsequent years, a TDR may cease being reported as impaired if the loan was modified at a market rate and has performed according to the modified terms for at least

six

payment periods. A loan that has been modified at a below market rate will return to performing status if it satisfies the

six

payment periods performance requirement; however, it will remain reported as impaired. Impairment is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, or the loan's observable market value. If the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan, based on the certainty of loss, either a specific allowance is established, or a charge-off is recorded, for the difference. Smaller balance (individually less than

$1,000,000

) homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards. Northern Trust’s accounting policies for material impaired loans is consistent across all classes of loans and leases.

Premium, Discounts, Origination Costs and Fees.

Premiums and discounts on loans are recognized as an adjustment of yield using the interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan. Certain direct origination costs and fees are netted, deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to the loan’s yield.

Direct Financing and Leveraged Leases.

Unearned lease income from direct financing and leveraged leases is recognized using the interest method. This method provides a constant rate of return on the unrecovered investment over the life of the lease. The rate of return and the allocation of income over the lease term are recalculated from the inception of the lease if during the lease term assumptions regarding the amount or timing of estimated cash flows change. Lease residual values are established at the inception of the lease based on in-house valuations and market analyses provided by outside parties. Lease residual values are reviewed at least annually for OTTI. A decline in the estimated residual value of a leased asset determined to be other-than-temporary would be recorded in the period in which the decline is identified as a reduction of interest income.

I. Allowance for Credit Losses.

The allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. The loan and lease portfolio and other lending-related credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses. In determining an


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

appropriate allowance level, Northern Trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lending-related commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lending-related credit exposures. The allowance for credit losses consists of the following components:

Specific Allowance.

The specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lending-related commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows, the value of collateral, and other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay. For impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance, if any, is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management. These appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral.

Inherent Allowance.

The inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss data specific to the Northern Trust loan and lease portfolio. The estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into homogeneous segments. For each segment, the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance. The quantitative inherent allowance is then reviewed within the qualitative adjustment framework, where management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not fully contemplated in the quantitative methodology to compute an adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio.

The results of the inherent allowance estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by Northern Trust’s Loan Loss Reserve Committee, which includes representatives from Credit Risk Management, reporting segment management, and Corporate Finance.

Loans, leases, and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Northern Trust’s policies relative to the charging-off of uncollectible loans and leases are consistent across both loan and lease segments. Determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are charged-off or a specific reserve is established are based on management’s assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss. The provision for credit losses, which is charged to income, is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level determined to be appropriate through the above processes. Actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater or less than actual net charge-offs.

Northern Trust analyzes its exposure to credit losses from both on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet activity using a consistent methodology.

For purposes of estimating the allowance for credit losses for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit, the exposure at default includes an estimated drawdown of unused credit based on a credit conversion factor. The proportionate amount of the quantitative methodology calculation after any required adjustment in the qualitative framework results in the required allowance for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit as of the reporting date.

The portion of the allowance assigned to loans and leases is reported as a contra asset, directly following loans and leases in the consolidated balance sheets. The portion of the allowance assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit is reported in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

J. Standby Letters of Credit.

Fees on standby letters of credit are recognized in other operating income using the straight-line method over the lives of the underlying agreements. Northern Trust’s recorded other liability for standby letters of credit, reflecting the obligation it has undertaken, is measured as the amount of unamortized fees on these instruments.

K. Buildings and Equipment.

Buildings and equipment owned are carried at original cost less accumulated depreciation. The charge for depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the following range of lives: buildings – up to

30 years

; equipment –


to

10 years

; and leasehold improvements–the shorter of the lease term or

15 years

. Leased properties meeting certain criteria are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the lease period.

L. Other Real Estate Owned (OREO).

OREO is comprised of commercial and residential real estate properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans. OREO assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Fair value is typically based on third-party appraisals. Appraisals of OREO properties are updated on an annual basis and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the properties. Losses identified during the


-day period after the acquisition of such properties are charged against the allowance for credit losses assigned to loans and leases. Subsequent


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

write-downs that may be required to the carrying value of these assets and gains or losses realized from asset sales are recorded within other operating expense.

M. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Goodwill is not subject to amortization. Separately identifiable acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, primarily on a straight-line basis. Purchased software, software licenses, and allowable internal costs, including compensation relating to software developed for internal use, are capitalized. Software is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from


to

10 years

. Fees paid for the use of software licenses that are not hosted by Northern Trust are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

N. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees.

Trust, investment and other servicing fees are recorded on an accrual basis, over the period in which the service is provided. Fees are a function of the market value of assets custodied, managed and serviced, the volume of transactions, securities lending volume and spreads, and fees for other services rendered, as set forth in the underlying client agreement. This revenue recognition involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including components that are calculated based on estimated asset valuations and transaction volumes.

O. Client Security Settlement Receivables.

These receivables result from custody client withdrawals from short-term investment funds that settle on the following business day as well as custody client security sales executed under contractual settlement date accounting that have not yet settled. Northern Trust advances cash to the client on the date of either client withdrawal or trade execution and awaits collection from either the short-term investment funds or via the settled trade.

P. Income Taxes.

Northern Trust follows an asset and liability approach to account for income taxes. The objective is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax rates.

Tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are evaluated based on their likelihood of being sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Only tax positions that are considered more-likely-than-not to be sustained are recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Northern Trust recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.

Q. Cash Flow Statements.

Cash and cash equivalents have been defined as “Cash and Due from Banks”.

R. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits.

Northern Trust records the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets. Funded pension and postretirement benefits are reported in other assets and unfunded pension and postretirement benefits are reported in other liabilities. Plan assets and benefit obligations are measured annually at December 31. Plan assets are determined based on fair value generally representing observable market prices. The projected benefit obligations are determined based on the present value of projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate. Pension costs are recognized ratably over the estimated working lifetime of eligible participants.

S. Share-Based Compensation Plans.

Northern Trust recognizes as compensation expense the grant-date fair value of stock and stock unit awards and other share-based compensation granted to employees within the consolidated statements of income. The fair values of stock and stock unit awards, including performance stock unit awards and director awards, are based on the closing price of the Corporation’s stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model utilizes weighted-average assumptions regarding the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding (expected term) based primarily on the historical exercise behavior attributable to previous option grants, the estimated yield from dividends paid on the Corporation’s stock over the expected term of the options, the historical volatility of Northern Trust’s stock price and the implied volatility of traded options on Northern Trust stock, and a risk free interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for a period equal to the expected term of the options granted.

Compensation expense for share-based award grants with terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule, whereby portions of the award vest in increments over the requisite service period, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Compensation expense for performance stock unit awards are recognized on a


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on expected achievement of the performance condition.

Northern Trust does not include an estimate of future forfeitures in its recognition of share-based compensation expense. Share-based compensation expense is adjusted based on forfeitures as they occur. Dividend equivalents are paid on performance stock unit awards granted prior to February 16, 2016 and restricted stock units granted prior to February 21, 2017 that are not yet vested. Dividend equivalents are accrued on performance stock unit awards granted on or after February 16, 2016, restricted stock units granted on or after February 21, 2017 and director awards not yet vested, and are paid upon vesting. Cash flows resulting from the realization of excess tax benefits are classified as operating cash flows.

T. Net Income Per Common Share.

Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income/loss applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock and potential common shares by the aggregate of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and common share equivalents calculated for stock options outstanding using the treasury stock method. In a period of a net loss, diluted net income per common share is calculated in the same manner as basic net income per common share.

Northern Trust has issued certain restricted stock unit awards, which are unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. These units are considered participating securities. Accordingly, Northern Trust calculates net income applicable to common stock using the two-class method, whereby net income is allocated between common stock and participating securities.

Note 2 – Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2017, the Corporation adopted ASU 2016-05, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effects of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)” (ASU 2016-05).

ASU 2016-05 clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815, does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-05, the Corporation did not dedesignate any hedging relationships due to change in counterparty and therefore there was no impact to its consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

On January 1, 2017, the Corporation adopted ASU 2016-06, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)” (ASU 2016-06).

The amendments in ASU 2016-06 clarify what steps are required when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call (put) options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts, which is one of the criteria for bifurcating an embedded derivative. The Corporation had already applied the approach for analyzing potential embedded derivative instruments in debt instruments detailed in ASU 2016-06 and therefore upon adoption there was no impact to its consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

On January 1, 2017, the Corporation adopted ASU 2016-07, “Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting” (ASU 2016-07), which

requires that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, the  equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor’s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-07, the Corporation did not hold an interest in an investee that subsequently qualified for the use of the equity method and therefore there was no impact to its consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

On January 1, 2017, the Corporation adopted ASU 2016-17, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control” (ASU 2016-17).

Under ASU 2016-17, a single decision maker evaluating whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity will consider its indirect interests held by related parties that are under common control on a proportionate basis. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-17, there was no impact to the Corporation’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Note 3 – Fair Value Measurements

Fair value under GAAP is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Fair Value Hierarchy.

The following describes the hierarchy of valuation inputs (Levels 1, 2, and 3) used to measure fair value and the primary valuation methodologies used by Northern Trust for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity; unobservable inputs reflect the entity’s own assumptions about how market participants would value an asset or liability based on the best information available. GAAP requires an entity measuring fair value to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and establishes a fair value hierarchy of inputs. Financial instruments are categorized within the hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to their valuation. Northern Trust’s policy is to recognize transfers into and transfers out of fair value levels as of the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred. No transfers between fair value levels occurred during the years ended

December 31, 2017

, or


.

Level 1 – Quoted, active market prices for identical assets or liabilities.

Northern Trust’s Level 1 assets are comprised of available for sale investments in U.S. treasury securities.

Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted active market prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.

Northern Trust’s Level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities, the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors. Prices received from vendors are compared to other vendor and third-party prices. If a security price obtained from a pricing vendor is determined to exceed pre-determined tolerance levels that are assigned based on an asset type’s characteristics, the exception is researched and, if the price is not able to be validated, an alternate pricing vendor is utilized, consistent with Northern Trust’s pricing source hierarchy. As of

December 31, 2017

, Northern Trust’s available for sale securities portfolio included

1,436

Level 2 securities with an aggregate market value of

$28.0 billion

. All

1,436

securities were valued by external pricing vendors. As of

December 31, 2016

, Northern Trust’s available for sale securities portfolio included

1,409

Level 2 securities with an aggregate market value of

$28.1 billion

. All

1,409

securities were valued by external pricing vendors. Trading account securities, which totaled

$0.5 million

and

$0.3 million

as of

December 31, 2017

, and

December 31, 2016

, respectively, were all valued using external pricing vendors.

Northern Trust has established processes and procedures to assess the suitability of valuation methodologies used by external pricing vendors, including reviews of valuation techniques and assumptions used for selected securities. On a daily basis, periodic quality control reviews of prices received from vendors are conducted which include comparisons to prices on similar security types received from multiple pricing vendors and to the previous day’s reported prices for each security. Predetermined tolerance level exceptions are researched and may result in additional validation through available market information or the use of an alternate pricing vendor. Quarterly, Northern Trust reviews documentation from third-party pricing vendors regarding the valuation processes and assumptions used in their valuations and assesses whether the fair value levels assigned by Northern Trust to each security classification are appropriate. Annually, valuation inputs used within third-party pricing vendor valuations are reviewed for propriety on a sample basis through a comparison of inputs used to comparable market data, including security classifications that are less actively traded and security classifications comprising significant portions of the portfolio.

Level 2 assets and liabilities also include derivative contracts which are valued internally using widely accepted income-based models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect the contractual terms of the contracts. Observable inputs include foreign exchange rates and interest rates for foreign exchange contracts; credit spreads, default probabilities, and recovery rates for credit default swap contracts; interest rates for interest rate swap contracts and forward contracts; and interest rates and volatility inputs for interest rate option contracts. Northern Trust evaluates the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of its derivative instruments. Factors considered include the likelihood of default by Northern Trust and its counterparties, the remaining maturities of the instruments, net exposures after giving effect to master netting arrangements or similar agreements, available collateral, and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments. The resulting valuation adjustments have not been considered material.

Level 3 – Valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace.

Northern Trust’s Level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities purchased in 2008 from Northern Trust clients. To estimate the fair value of auction rate securities, Northern Trust uses external pricing vendors that incorporate transaction details and market-based inputs such as past auction results, trades and bids. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are the prices of the securities supported by little market activity and for which trading is limited.

Northern Trust’s Level 3 liabilities consist of swaps that Northern Trust entered into with the purchaser of

1.1 million

and

1.0 million

shares of Visa Inc. Class B common stock (Visa Class B common shares) previously held by Northern Trust and sold in June 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pursuant to the swaps, Northern Trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into shares of Visa Inc. Class A common stock (Visa Class A common shares), such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and Northern Trust will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. The swap also requires periodic


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

payments from Northern Trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of Visa Class A common shares and a fixed rate of interest. The fair value of the swap is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are Northern Trust’s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares, the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the Visa Class A common share price. See “Visa Class B Common Shares” under Note 24 — “Contingent Liabilities,” for further information.

Northern Trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate; however, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to Level 3 assets and liabilities, could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values.

Management of various businesses and departments of Northern Trust (including Corporate Market Risk, Credit Risk Management, Corporate Finance, C&IS and Wealth Management) reviews valuation methods and models for Level 3 assets and liabilities. Fair value measurements are performed upon acquisitions of an asset or liability. Management of the appropriate business or department reviews assumed inputs, especially when unobservable in the marketplace, in order to substantiate their use in each fair value measurement. When appropriate, management reviews forecasts used in the valuation process in light of other relevant financial projections to understand any variances between current and previous fair value measurements. In certain circumstances, third party information is used to support the fair value measurements. If certain third party information seems inconsistent with consensus views, a review of the information is performed by management of the respective business or department to determine the appropriate fair value of the asset or liability.

there were no assets or liabilities transferred into or out of Level 3.

Carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis may be adjusted to fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition, for example, to record an impairment of an asset. GAAP requires entities to separately disclose these subsequent fair value measurements and to classify them under the fair value hierarchy.

Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at

December 31, 2017

and


, all of which were categorized as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy, were comprised of impaired loans whose values were based on real-estate and other available collateral, and of OREO properties. Fair values of real-estate loan collateral were estimated using a market approach typically supported by third-party valuations and property-specific fees and taxes, and were subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to realizable value. Other loan collateral, which typically consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, is valued using a market approach adjusted for asset specific characteristics and in limited instances third-party valuations are used.

Collateral-based impaired loans and OREO assets that have been adjusted to fair value totaled

$12.2 million

and

$0.3 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2017

, and

$6.7 million

.

TABLE 49: LEVEL 3 NONRECURRING BASIS SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value. It excludes from this requirement nonfinancial assets and liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise, relationship, and intangible values that add value to Northern Trust. Accordingly, the required fair value disclosures provide only a partial estimate of the fair value of Northern Trust. Financial instruments recorded at fair value on Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets are discussed above. The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value.

Held to Maturity Securities.

The fair values of held to maturity securities, excluding U.S. Treasury securities, were obtained from external pricing vendors, or in limited cases internally, using widely accepted methods which are based on an income approach that incorporates current market yield curves. The fair values of U.S. Treasury securities were determined using quoted, active market prices for identical securities.

Loans (excluding lease receivables).

The fair value of the loan portfolio was estimated using an income approach (discounted cash flow) that incorporates current market rates offered by Northern Trust as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. The fair values of all loans were adjusted to reflect current assessments of loan collectability. Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.

Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank Stock.

The fair values of Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock are equal to their carrying values which represent redemption value.

Community Development Investments.

The fair values of these instruments were estimated using an income approach (discounted cash flow) that incorporates current market rates.

Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation.

These assets include U.S. treasury securities and investments in mutual and collective trust funds held to fund certain supplemental employee benefit obligations and deferred compensation plans. Fair values of U.S. treasury securities were determined using quoted, active market prices for identical securities. The fair values of investments in mutual and collective trust funds were valued at the funds’ net asset values based on a market approach.

Savings Certificates and Other Time Deposits.

The fair values of these instruments were estimated using an income approach (discounted cash flow) that incorporates market interest rates currently offered by Northern Trust for deposits with similar maturities.

Senior Notes, Subordinated Debt, and Floating Rate Capital Debt.

Fair values were determined using a market approach based on quoted market prices, when available. If quoted market prices were not available, fair values were based on quoted market prices for comparable instruments.

Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings.

The fair values of these instruments were estimated using an income approach (discounted cash flow) that incorporates market interest rates available to Northern Trust.

Loan Commitments.

The fair values of loan commitments represent the estimated costs to terminate or otherwise settle the obligations with a third party adjusted for any related allowance for credit losses.

Standby Letters of Credit.

The fair values of standby letters of credit are measured as the amount of unamortized fees on these instruments, inclusive of the related allowance for credit losses. Fees are determined by applying basis points to the principal amounts of the letters of credit.

Financial Instruments Valued at Carrying Value.

Due to their short maturity, the carrying values of certain financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash and due from banks; federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing deposits with banks, Federal Reserve deposits and other interest-bearing assets; client security settlement receivables; non-U.S. offices interest-bearing deposits; federal funds purchased; securities sold under agreements to repurchase; and other borrowings (includes term federal funds purchased, and other short-term borrowings). The fair values of demand, noninterest-bearing, savings, and money market deposits represent the amounts payable on demand as of the reporting date.

As of

1,285

securities with a combined fair value of

$27.6 billion

were in an unrealized loss position, with their unrealized losses totaling

$249.4 million

. Unrealized losses of

$108.6 million

and

$32.1 million

related to government sponsored agency and U.S. government securities, respectively, are primarily attributable to changes in market rates since their purchase. Unrealized losses of

$23.3 million

within corporate debt securities primarily reflect widened credit spreads and higher market rates since purchase;

36%

of the corporate debt portfolio is backed by guarantees provided by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities.

The majority of the

$45.2 million

of unrealized losses in securities classified as “other” at

December 31, 2017

, relate to securities primarily purchased at a premium or par by Northern Trust to fulfill its obligations under the CRA. Unrealized losses on these CRA related other securities are attributable to yields that are below market rates for the purpose of supporting institutions and programs that benefit low to moderate income communities within Northern Trust’s market


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

area. The remaining unrealized losses on Northern Trust’s securities portfolio as of

December 31, 2017

, are attributable to changes in overall market interest rates, increased credit spreads, or reduced market liquidity. As of

December 31, 2017

, Northern Trust does not intend to sell any investment in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that Northern Trust will be required to sell any such investment before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.

Security impairment reviews are conducted quarterly to identify and evaluate securities that have indications of possible OTTI. A determination as to whether a security’s decline in market value is other-than-temporary takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security. Factors Northern Trust considers in determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary include, but are not limited to, the length of time the security has been impaired; the severity of the impairment; the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; activity in the market of the issuer which may indicate adverse credit conditions; Northern Trust’s intent regarding the sale of the security as of the balance sheet date; and the likelihood that it will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. For each security meeting the requirements of Northern Trust’s internal screening process, an extensive review is conducted to determine if OTTI has occurred.

While all securities are considered, the process for identifying credit impairment within CRA eligible mortgage-backed securities, the security type for which Northern Trust has recognized all of the OTTI in


and


, incorporates an expected loss approach using discounted cash flows on the underlying collateral pools. To evaluate whether an unrealized loss on CRA mortgage-backed securities is other-than-temporary, a calculation of the security’s present value is made using current pool data, the current delinquency pipeline, default rates and loan loss severities based on the historical performance of the pool or similar pools, and Northern Trust’s outlook for the housing market and the overall economy. If the present value of the collateral pools was found to be less than the current amortized cost of the security, a credit-related OTTI loss would be recorded in earnings equal to the difference between the two amounts.

Impairments of CRA mortgage-backed securities are influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to, U.S. economic and housing market performance, pool credit enhancement level, year of origination, and estimated credit quality of the collateral. The factors used in estimating losses related to CRA mortgage-backed securities vary by vintage of loan origination and collateral quality.

Note 5 – Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until the repurchase.

The following tables summarize information related to securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

Note 6 – Loans and Leases

During 2017, the Corporation implemented a change in the classification of certain loans and leases to enhance the consistency of its reporting across various regulatory regimes.

As a result, certain prior-period loan and lease balances

below

have been adjusted to conform with current-period presentation.

The adjustments generally reflected reclassification of loans and leases from the commercial and institutional class to the residential real estate class.

There was no impact on total loans and leases previously reported.

The previously reported allowance for credit losses remains unadjusted, as the impact of the reclassification on the allowance was immaterial.

Amounts outstanding for loans and leases, by segment and class, are shown below.

TABLE 60: LOANS AND LEASES

Residential real estate loans consist of traditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines that generally require a loan to collateral value ratio of no more than

65%

to

80%

at inception. Northern Trust’s equity credit line products generally have draw periods of up to

10 years

and a balloon payment of any outstanding balance is due at maturity. Payments are interest only with variable interest rates. Northern Trust does not offer equity credit lines that include an option to convert the outstanding balance to an amortizing payment loan. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, equity credit lines totaled

$908.6 million

and

$1.2 billion

, respectively, and equity credit lines for which first liens were held by Northern Trust represented

93%

and

91%

, respectively, of the total equity credit lines as of those dates.

Included within the non-U.S., commercial-other, and personal-other classes are short duration advances, primarily related to the processing of custodied client investments, that totaled

$906.4 million

and

$1.4 billion

at

December 31, 2017

The following schedule reflects the future minimum lease payments to be received over the next five years under direct finance leases.

TABLE 62: FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS

Credit Quality Indicators.

Credit quality indicators are statistics, measurements or other metrics that provide information regarding the relative credit risk of loans and leases. Northern Trust utilizes a variety of credit quality indicators to assess the credit risk of loans and leases at the segment, class, and individual credit exposure levels.

As part of its credit process, Northern Trust utilizes an internal borrower risk rating system to support identification, approval, and monitoring of credit risk. Borrower risk ratings are used in credit underwriting and management reporting.

Risk ratings are used for ranking the credit risk of borrowers and the probability of their default. Each borrower is rated using one of a number of ratings models, which consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. The ratings models vary among classes of loans and leases in order to capture the unique risk characteristics inherent within each particular type of credit exposure. Provided below are the more significant performance indicator attributes considered within Northern Trust’s borrower rating models, by loan and lease class.

•

Commercial and Institutional: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, asset size and capital levels;

•

Commercial Real Estate: debt service coverage, loan-to-value ratio, leasing status and guarantor support;

•

Lease Financing and Commercial-Other: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, asset size and capital levels;

•

Non-U.S.: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, return on assets and capital levels;

•

Residential Real Estate: payment history, credit bureau scores and loan-to-value ratio;

•

Private Client: cash flow-to-debt and net worth ratios, leverage and liquidity; and

•

Personal-Other: cash flow-to-debt and net worth ratios.

While the criteria vary by model, the objective is for the borrower ratings to be consistent in both the measurement and ranking of risk. Each model is calibrated to a master rating scale to support this consistency. Ratings for borrowers not in default range from “1” for the strongest credits to “7” for the weakest non-defaulted credits. Ratings of “8” or “9” are used for defaulted borrowers. Borrower risk ratings are monitored and are revised when events or circumstances indicate a change is required. Risk ratings are generally validated at least annually.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Loan and lease segment and class balances at

December 31, 2017

and


are provided below, segregated by borrower ratings into “1 to 3”, “4 to 5”, and “6 to 9” (watch list), categories.

TABLE 63: BORROWER RATINGS

Loans and leases in the “1 to 3” category are expected to exhibit minimal to modest probabilities of default and are characterized by borrowers having the strongest financial qualities, including above average financial flexibility, cash flows and capital levels. Borrowers assigned these ratings are anticipated to experience very little to moderate financial pressure in adverse down cycle scenarios. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers within this category exhibit a minimal to modest likelihood of loss.

Loans and leases in the “4 to 5” category are expected to exhibit moderate to acceptable probabilities of default and are characterized by borrowers with less financial flexibility than those in the “1 to 3” category. Cash flows and capital levels are generally sufficient to allow for borrowers to meet current requirements, but have reduced cushion in adverse down cycle scenarios. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers within this category exhibit a moderate likelihood of loss.

Loans and leases in the watch list category have elevated credit risk profiles that are monitored through internal watch lists, and consist of credits with borrower ratings of “6 to 9”. These credits, which include all nonperforming credits, are expected to exhibit minimally acceptable probabilities of default, elevated risk of default, or are currently in default. Borrowers associated with these risk profiles that are not currently in default have limited financial flexibility. Cash flows and capital levels range from acceptable to potentially insufficient to meet current requirements, particularly in adverse down cycle scenarios. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers in this category exhibit an elevated to probable likelihood of loss.

Note: Period-end balances reflect all paydowns and charge-offs during the year.

TDR modifications primarily involve extensions of term, deferrals of principal, interest rate concessions, and other modifications. Other modifications typically reflect other nonstandard terms which Northern Trust would not offer in non-troubled situations. During the year ended

December 31, 2017

TDR modifications of loans within residential real estate were primarily extensions of term, deferrals of principal, interest rate concessions, and other modifications. During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, the majority of TDR modifications of loans within commercial and institutional, commercial real estate, and private client classes were primarily extensions of term or deferrals of principal. During the year ended

December 31, 2016

, TDR modifications of loans within residential real estate loans were primarily extensions of term, deferrals of principal, interest rate concessions and other modifications; modification within commercial and institutional, commercial real estate, and private client classes were primarily extensions of term and other modifications.

There were

two

loans or leases modified in TDRs during the previous twelve-month periods which subsequently became nonperforming during the year ended

. There were

five

loans or leases modified in TDRs during the previous twelve-month periods which subsequently became nonperforming during the year ended

All loans and leases modified in troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment. The nature and extent of impairment of TDRs, including those which have experienced a subsequent default, is considered in the determination of an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses.

Northern Trust may obtain physical possession of residential real estate collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan via foreclosure. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, Northern Trust held foreclosed residential real estate properties with a carrying value of

$4.3 million

and


, Northern Trust had consumer loans with a carrying value of

$14.1 million

and

$25.9 million

, respectively, collateralized by residential real estate property for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process.

Note 7 – Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses, which represents management’s estimate of probable losses related to specific borrower relationships and inherent in the various loan and lease portfolios, undrawn commitments, and standby letters of credit, is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process. Northern Trust’s accounting policies related to the estimation of the allowance for credit losses and the charging off of loans, leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are consistent across both loan and lease segments.

Loans, leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Determinations as to whether an uncollectible loan is charged off or a specific allowance is established are based on management’s assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss.

Changes in the allowance for credit losses by segment were as follows:

TABLE 68: RECORDED INVESTMENTS IN LOANS AND LEASES

Note 8 – Concentrations of Credit Risk

Concentrations of credit risk exist if a number of borrowers or other counterparties are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The fact that a credit exposure falls into one of these groups does not necessarily indicate that the credit has a higher than normal degree of credit risk. These groups are: banks and bank holding companies, residential real estate, and commercial real estate.

Banks and Bank Holding Companies.

On-balance-sheet credit risk to banks and bank holding companies, both U.S. and non-U.S., consists primarily of interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, which totaled

$6.9 billion

and

$6.8 billion

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, and noninterest-bearing demand balances maintained at correspondent banks, which totaled

$2.1 billion

and

$1.9 billion

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. Credit risk associated with U.S. and non-U.S. banks and bank holding companies deemed to be counterparties by Credit Risk Management is managed by the Capital Markets Credit Committee. Credit limits are established through a review process that includes an internally-prepared financial analysis, use of an internal risk rating system and consideration of external ratings from rating agencies. Northern Trust places deposits with banks that have strong internal and external credit ratings and the average life to maturity of deposits with banks is maintained on a short-term basis in order to respond quickly to changing credit conditions.

Residential Real Estate.

At

December 31, 2017

, residential real estate loans totaled

$7.2 billion

, or

23%

of total U.S. loans at

December 31, 2017

, compared with

$8.1 billion

, or

25%

of total U.S. loans at

December 31, 2016

. Residential real estate loans consist of traditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines, which generally require a loan-to-collateral value ratio of no more than

65%

to

80%

at inception. Revaluations of supporting collateral are obtained upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted. Collateral revaluations for mortgages are performed by independent third parties. Of the total

$7.2 billion

in residential real estate loans,

$1.9 billion

were in Florida,

$1.4 billion

were in the greater Chicago area, and

$1.4 billion

were in California, with the remainder distributed throughout the other geographic regions within the U.S. served by Northern Trust. Legally binding undrawn commitments to extend residential real estate credit, which are primarily equity credit lines totaled

$1.0 billion

and

$1.2 billion

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

Commercial Real Estate.

The commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended to experienced investors well known to Northern Trust. Underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage requirements. Recourse to borrowers through guarantees is also commonly required. Commercial mortgage financing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of income-producing properties. Cash flows from the properties generally are sufficient to amortize the loan. These loans are primarily located in the

Illinois

,

California

,

Florida

,

Texas

, and

Arizona

markets. Construction, acquisition and development loans provide financing for commercial real estate prior to rental income stabilization. The intent is generally that the borrower will sell the project or refinance the loan through a commercial mortgage with Northern Trust or another financial institution upon completion.

Note 13 – Floating Rate Capital Debt

In January 1997, the Corporation issued

$150 million

of Floating Rate Capital Securities, Series A, through a statutory business trust wholly owned by the Corporation (NTC Capital I). In April 1997, the Corporation also issued, through a


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

separate wholly owned statutory business trust (NTC Capital II),

$120 million

of Floating Rate Capital Securities, Series B. The sole assets of the trusts are subordinated debentures of Northern Trust Corporation that have the same interest rates and maturity dates as the corresponding distribution rates and redemption dates of the Floating Rate Capital Securities. The Series A Securities were issued at a discount to yield

60.5

basis points above the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and are due

January 15, 2027

. The Series B Securities were issued at a discount to yield

67.9

basis points above the three-month LIBOR and are due

April 15, 2027

.

Under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the regulatory capital treatment of these securities is required to be phased out over a period that began on January 1, 2013. In


,

50%

of these securities are eligible for Tier 2 capital treatment, declining at an incremental 10% a year until they are fully phased out in 2022.

The Corporation has fully, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed all payments due on the Series A and B securities. The holders of the Series A and B securities are entitled to receive preferential cumulative cash distributions quarterly in arrears (based on the liquidation amount of

$1,000

per security) at an interest rate equal to the rate on the corresponding subordinated debentures. The interest rate on the Series A and Series B securities is equal to three-month LIBOR plus

0.52%

and

0.59%

, respectively. Subject to certain exceptions, the Corporation has the right to defer payment of interest on the subordinated debentures at any time or from time to time for a period not exceeding


consecutive quarterly periods provided that no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity date. If interest is deferred on the subordinated debentures, distributions on the Series A and B securities will also be deferred and the Corporation will not be permitted, subject to certain exceptions, to pay or declare any cash distributions with respect to the Corporation’s capital stock or debt securities that rank the same as or junior to the subordinated debentures, until all past due distributions are paid. The subordinated debentures are unsecured and subordinated to substantially all of the Corporation’s existing indebtedness.

The Corporation has the right to redeem the Series A and Series B subordinated debentures, in whole or in part, at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The following table summarizes the book values of the outstanding subordinated debentures as of

The tax provision for


includes a net benefit attributable to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of

$53.1 million

as outlined below, an increased income tax benefit derived from the vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises, and

Federal and State research tax credits of

$20.9 million

,

$17.6 million

of which were recognized related to the Corporation’s technology spend between 2013 and 2016, each resulting in a reduction of the effective tax rate.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017, and reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from

35%

to

21%

. It also requires companies to pay a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. At

December 31, 2017

, Northern Trust has made a reasonable estimate as to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as follows:

TABLE 87: IMPACT OF TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT

The amounts related to federal taxes on mandatory deemed repatriation and certain other adjustments are considered provisional as of

December 31, 2017

, as Northern Trust did not have the necessary information available to complete its accounting for the change in tax law and as such has provided a reasonable estimate. Northern Trust will continue to refine the related calculations as additional analyses are completed. In addition, these provisional amounts may require adjustment based on an evolving understanding of the new tax law and the issuance of guidance by the IRS.

The Corporation files income tax returns in the U.S. federal, various state, and foreign jurisdictions. The Corporation is no longer subject to income tax examinations by U.S. federal authorities before 2013, U.S. state or local tax authorities for years before 2011, or non-U.S. tax authorities for years before 2010.

Included in other liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets at

December 31, 2017

and


were

$27.7 million

and

$17.2 million

of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively. If recognized,


and


net income would have increased by

$21.7 million

and

$11.9 million

, respectively, resulting in a decrease of those years’ effective income tax rates. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

TABLE 88: UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

Unrecognized tax benefits had net increases of

$10.5 million

, resulting in a remaining balance of

$27.7 million

at

December 31, 2017

, compared to net increases of

$4.9 million

resulting in a remaining balance of

$17.2 million

at

December 31, 2016

. It is possible that changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could occur in the next 12 months due to changes in judgment related to recognition or measurement, settlements with taxing authorities, or expiration of statute of limitations. Management does not believe that future changes, if any, would have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of Northern Trust, although they could have a material effect on operating results for a particular period.

A provision for interest and penalties of

$0.1 million

, net of tax, was included in the provision for income taxes for the year ended

December 31, 2017

. This compares to a benefit of interest and penalties of

$1.6 million

, net of tax, for the year ended

December 31, 2016

. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the liability for the potential payment of interest and penalties totaled

$10.3 million

and

$9.9 million

, net of tax, respectively.

Pre-tax earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to U.S. taxation when effectively repatriated. Northern Trust provides for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, except to the extent that those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Northern Trust elected to indefinitely reinvest

$246.1 million

,

$237.1 million

, and

$257.4 million

of


,


, and


earnings, respectively, of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and, therefore, no U.S. deferred income taxes were recorded on those earnings.

As of

December 31, 2017

, the cumulative amount of the undistributed earnings in the Corporation’s foreign subsidiaries was approximately

$1.9 billion

. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act being enacted on December 22, 2017,


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

these earnings and the earnings from prior years which have been reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States are deemed to have been repatriated to the U.S. and subject to a repatriation tax. The repatriation tax has been estimated to be

$150.0 million

and recorded as an income tax provision. The repatriation tax will be paid in installments over eight years as permitted under U.S. income tax laws.

The components of the consolidated provision for income taxes for each of the three years ended

December 31

are as follows:

In addition to the amounts shown above, tax charges and benefits have been recorded directly to stockholders’ equity for the following:

TABLE 90: TAX CHARGES AND BENEFITS RECORDED DIRECTLY TO STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act being enacted on December 22, 2017, deferred tax assets and liabilities have been remeasured based on the federal tax rate at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is

21%

. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been computed as follows:

Note 21 – Employee Benefits

The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries provide various benefit programs, including defined benefit pension, postretirement health care, and defined contribution plans. A description of each major plan and related disclosures are provided below.

Pension.

A noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covers substantially all U.S. employees of Northern Trust. Employees of certain European subsidiaries retain benefits in local defined benefit plans, although those plans are closed to new participants and to future benefit accruals. Employees continue to accrue benefits under the Swiss pension plan, which is accounted for as a defined benefit plan under GAAP.

Northern Trust also maintains a noncontributory supplemental pension plan for participants whose retirement benefit payments under the U.S. plan are expected to exceed the limits imposed by federal tax law. Northern Trust has a nonqualified trust, referred to as a “Rabbi” Trust, used to hold assets designated for the funding of benefits in excess of those permitted in certain of its qualified retirement plans. This arrangement offers participants a degree of assurance for payment of benefits in excess of those permitted in the related qualified plans. As the “Rabbi” Trust assets remain subject to the claims of creditors and are not the property of the employees, they are accounted for as corporate assets and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Total assets in the “Rabbi” Trust related to the nonqualified pension plan at

December 31, 2017

and


amounted to

$116.7 million

and

$106.9 million

, respectively. Contributions of

During 2017, the investment strategy employed for Northern Trust's U.S. pension plan was changed to utilize a dynamic glide path based on a set of pre-approved asset allocations to return-seeking and liability-hedging assets that vary in accordance with the plan's projected benefit obligation funded ratio. In general, as the plan’s projected benefit obligation funded ratio increases beyond an established threshold, the plan’s allocation to liability-hedging assets will increase while the allocation to return-seeking assets will decrease. Conversely, a decrease in the plan’s projected benefit obligation funded ratio beyond an established threshold will result in a decrease in the plan’s allocation to liability-hedging assets and increase in the allocation to return-seeking assets. Liability-hedging assets include U.S. long credit bonds, U.S. long government bonds, and a custom completion strategy used to hedge more closely the liability duration of projected plan benefits with bond duration across all durations. Return-seeking assets include: U.S. equity, international developed equity, emerging markets equity, real estate, high yield bonds, global listed infrastructure, emerging market debt, private equity and hedge funds.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Northern Trust utilizes an asset/liability methodology to determine the investment policies that will best meet its short and long-term objectives. The process is performed by modeling current and alternative strategies for asset allocation, funding policy and actuarial methods and assumptions. The financial modeling uses projections of expected capital market returns and expected volatility of those returns to determine alternative asset mixes having the greatest probability of meeting the plan’s investment objectives. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming growth in plan liabilities over the long run.

The target allocation of plan assets since May 2017 is

45%

U.S. long credit bonds,

10%

U.S. long government bonds,

10%

custom completion,

8%

U.S. equities,

5%

international developed equity,

3%

emerging markets equity,

3%

real estate,

4%

high yield bonds,

3%

global listed infrastructure,

4%

emerging market debt,

2%

private equity, and

3%

hedge funds.

Equity investments include common stocks that are listed on an exchange and investments in commingled funds that invest primarily in publicly traded equities. Equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks and divided by investment style and market capitalization. Fixed income securities held include U.S. treasury securities and investments in commingled funds that invest in a diversified blend of longer duration fixed income securities; the custom completion strategy uses U.S. treasury securities and interest rate futures (or similar instruments) to align more closely with the target hedge ratio across maturities. Alternative investments, including private equity, hedge funds, real estate, and global infrastructure, are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Private equity assets consist primarily of investments in limited partnerships that invest in individual companies in the form of non-public equity or non-public debt positions. Direct or co-investment in non-public stock by the plan is prohibited. The plan’s private equity investments are limited to

2%

of the total limited partnership and the maximum allowable loss cannot exceed the commitment amount. The plan holds

two

investments in hedge funds of funds, which invest, either directly or indirectly, in diversified portfolios of funds or other pooled investment vehicles.

Investment in real estate is designed to provide stable income and added diversification.

Though not a primary strategy for meeting the plan’s objectives, derivatives may be used from time to time, depending on the nature of the asset class to which they relate, to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner, to hedge foreign currency exposure or interest rate risk, or to alter the duration of a portfolio. There were

five

derivatives held by the plan at

December 31,


. There were

no

derivatives held by the plan at

December 31, 2016

.

Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through monthly liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews. Standards used to evaluate the plan’s investment manager performance include, but are not limited to, the achievement of objectives, operation within guidelines and policy, and comparison against a relative benchmark. In addition, each manager of the investment funds held by the plan is ranked against a universe of peers and compared to a relative benchmark. Total plan performance analysis includes an analysis of the market environment, asset allocation impact on performance, risk and return relative to other ERISA plans, and manager impacts upon plan performance.

The following describes the hierarchy of inputs used to measure fair value and the primary valuation methodologies used by Northern Trust for the U.S. qualified plan assets measured at fair value.

Level 1 – Quoted, active market prices for identical assets or liabilities.

The Plan’s Level 1 investments are comprised of a mutual fund and domestic common stocks. The Plan’s Level 1 investments that are exchange traded are valued at the closing price reported by the respective exchanges on the day of valuation.

Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted active market prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.

The Plan’s Level 2 assets are comprised of U.S. government obligations and collective trust funds. The investments in collective trust funds fair values are calculated on a scheduled basis using the closing market prices and accruals of securities in the funds (total value of the funds) divided by the number of fund shares currently issued and outstanding. Redemptions of the collective trust funds occur by contract at the respective fund’s redemption date NAV.

Level 3 – Valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace.

The Plan’s Level 3 assets are comprised of private equity and hedge funds which invest in underlying groups of investment funds or other pooled investment vehicles that are selected by the respective funds’ investment managers. The investment funds and the underlying investments held by these investment funds are valued at fair value. In determining the fair value of the underlying investments of each fund, the fund’s investment manager or general partner takes into account the estimated value reported by the underlying funds as well as any other considerations that may, in their judgment, increase or decrease such estimated value.

While Northern Trust believes its valuation methods for plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to Level 3 assets, could have a material effect on the computation of the estimated fair values.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following table presents the fair values of Northern Trust’s U.S. pension plan assets, by major asset category, and their level within the fair value hierarchy defined by GAAP as of

December 31, 2017

The following table presents the changes in Level 3 assets for the years ended

December 31, 2017

and


.

TABLE 99: CHANGE IN LEVEL 3 ASSETS

Note: The return on plan assets represents the change in the unrealized gain (loss) on assets still held at December 31.

A building block approach is employed for Northern Trust’s U.S. pension plan in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets and long-term historical relationships between equities, fixed income and other asset classes are studied using the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long-run. Current market factors such as inflation expectations and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio rate of return is established with consideration given to diversification and rebalancing. The rate is reviewed against peer data and historical returns to verify the return is reasonable and appropriate. Based on this approach and the plan’s target asset allocation, the expected long-term rate of return on assets as of the plan’s

December 31, 2017

, measurement date was set at

6.00%

.

All employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and all directors of the Corporation are eligible to receive awards under the 2017 Plan. The 2017 Plan provides for the grant of nonqualified and incentive stock options; tandem and free-standing stock appreciation rights; stock awards in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock awards; and performance awards.

Beginning with grants made on February 21, 2017 under the Northern Trust Corporation 2012 Stock Plan (2012 Plan), restricted stock unit and performance stock unit grants continue to vest in accordance with the original terms of the award if the applicable employee retires, after satisfying applicable age and service requirements.

For all applicable periods, stock option grants continue to vest in accordance with the original terms of the award if the applicable employee retires, after satisfying applicable age and service requirements.

Grants are outstanding under the 2017 Plan, the 2012 Plan, and the Amended and Restated Northern Trust Corporation 2002 Stock Plan (2002 Plan). The 2017 Plan was approved by stockholders in April 2017. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan, no additional shares have been or will be granted under the 2012 Plan or 2002 Plan. The total number of shares of the Corporation’s common stock authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan is

are as follows:

TABLE 107: WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR OPTIONS GRANTED

The expected term of options represents the period of time options granted are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the historical exercise behavior attributable to previous option grants. Dividend yield represents the estimated yield from dividends paid on the Corporation’s common stock over the expected term of the options. Expected volatility is determined based on a combination of the historical volatility of Northern Trust’s stock price and the implied volatility of traded options on Northern Trust stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for a period equal to the expected term of the options granted.

Note 24 – Contingent Liabilities

Legal Proceedings.

In the normal course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to pending and threatened legal actions, and are subject to regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings, both formal and informal. In certain legal actions, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted. In regulatory matters, claims for disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other remedial actions or sanctions may be sought. Based on current knowledge, after consultation with legal counsel and after taking into account


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

current accruals, management does not believe that the losses, fines or penalties, if any, arising from pending litigation or threatened legal actions or regulatory matters either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation, although such matters could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operating results for a particular period.

Under GAAP, (i) an event is “probable” if the “future event or events are likely to occur”; (ii) an event is “reasonably possible” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely”; and (iii) an event is “remote” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.”

The outcome of litigation and regulatory matters is inherently difficult to predict and/or the range of loss often cannot be reasonably estimated, particularly for matters that (i) will be decided by a jury, (ii) are in early stages, (iii) involve uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iv) are subject to appeals or motions, (v) involve significant factual issues to be resolved, including with respect to the amount of damages, (vi) do not specify the amount of damages sought or (vii) seek very large damages based on novel and complex damage and liability legal theories. Accordingly, the Corporation cannot reasonably estimate the eventual outcome of these pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties, if any, related to each pending matter will be.

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation records accruals for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. When loss contingencies are not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Corporation does not record accruals.

No

material accruals have been recorded for pending litigation or threatened legal actions or regulatory matters.

For a limited number of matters for which a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss. As of

December 31, 2017

, the Corporation has estimated the range of reasonably possible loss for these matters to be from

zero

to approximately

$30 million

in the aggregate. The Corporation’s estimate with respect to the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate.

In certain other pending matters, there may be a range of reasonably possible loss (including reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued) that cannot be reasonably estimated for the reasons described above. Such matters are not included in the estimate of reasonably possible loss discussed above.

In January 2015, the Public Prosecutor’s Office of France recommended that certain charges be brought against Northern Trust Fiduciary Services (Guernsey) Limited (NTFS), an indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, relating to the administration of

two

trusts for which NTFS serves as trustee. In April 2015, a French investigating magistrate judge charged NTFS with complicity in estate tax fraud. Charges also were brought against a number of other persons and entities related to this matter. The trial related to this matter concluded in October 2016. In January 2017, the French court found no estate tax fraud had occurred and NTFS and all other persons and entities charged were acquitted. The Public Prosecutor’s Office of France has appealed the court decision. The proceedings in the appellate court are scheduled to begin in March 2018. As trustee, NTFS provided no tax advice and had no involvement in the preparation or filing of the challenged estate tax filings.

Visa Class B Common Shares.

Northern Trust, as a member of Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A.) and in connection with the 2007 restructuring of Visa U.S.A. and its affiliates and the 2008 initial public offering of Visa Inc. (Visa), received certain Visa Class B common shares. The Visa Class B common shares are subject to certain selling restrictions until the final resolution of the covered litigation noted below, at which time the shares are convertible into Visa Class A common shares based on a conversion rate dependent upon the ultimate cost of resolving the covered litigation.

Certain members of Visa U.S.A. are obligated to indemnify Visa for losses resulting from certain litigation relating to interchange fees (the covered litigation). On October 19, 2012, Visa signed a settlement agreement with plaintiff representatives for binding settlement of the covered litigation. On January 14, 2014, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs. A number of objectors appealed from that order and more than


opt-out cases have been filed by merchants in various federal district courts. On June 30, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court's approval of the settlement and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. In November 2016, a subset of plaintiffs filed a certiorari petition with the Supreme Court of the United States. In March 2017, the Supreme Court denied that petition. The ultimate resolution of the covered litigation and the timing for removal of the selling restrictions on the Visa Class B common shares are uncertain.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In June 2016 and 2015, Northern Trust recorded a

$123.1 million

and

$99.9 million

net gain on the sale of

1.1 million

and

1.0 million

of its Visa Class B common shares, respectively. These sales do not affect Northern Trust’s risk related to the impact of the covered litigation on the rate at which such shares will ultimately convert into Visa Class A common shares. Northern Trust continued to hold approximately

4.1 million

Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at their original cost basis of

zero

as of both December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Note 25 – Derivative Financial Instruments

Northern Trust is a party to various derivative financial instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients; as part of its trading activity for its own account; and as part of its risk management activities. These instruments include foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts, total return swap contracts, credit default swap contracts, and swaps related to the sale of certain Visa Class B common shares

Northern Trust’s primary risks associated with these instruments is the possibility that interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, or credit spreads could change in an unanticipated manner, resulting in higher costs or a loss in the underlying value of the instrument. These risks are mitigated by establishing limits, monitoring the level of actual positions taken against such established limits, and monitoring the level of any interest rate sensitivity gaps created by such positions. When establishing position limits, market liquidity and volatility, as well as experience in each market, are taken into account.

Credit risk associated with derivative instruments relates to the failure of the counterparty and the failure of Northern Trust to pay based on the contractual terms of the agreement, and is generally limited to the unrealized fair value gains and losses on these instruments, net of any collateral received or deposited. The amount of credit risk will increase or decrease during the lives of the instruments as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices or credit spreads fluctuate. Northern Trust’s risk is controlled by limiting such activity to an approved list of counterparties and by subjecting such activity to the same credit and quality controls as are followed in lending and investment activities. Credit Support Annexes and other similar agreements are currently in place with a number of Northern Trust’s counterparties which mitigate the aforementioned credit risk associated with derivative activity conducted with those counterparties by requiring that significant net unrealized fair value gains be supported by collateral placed with Northern Trust.

Northern Trust has elected to net derivative assets and liabilities when legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist between Northern Trust and the counterparty. Derivative assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheets were each reduced by

$1.4 billion

and

$1.7 billion

as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively, as a result of master netting arrangements and similar agreements in place. Derivative assets and liabilities recorded at

December 31, 2017

also reflect reductions of

$427.6 million

and

$189.0 million

, respectively, as a result of cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties. This compares with reductions of derivative assets and liabilities of

$461.3 million

and

$722.1 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2016

. Additional cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties totaling

$67.0 million

and

$143.1 million

, respectively, as of

December 31, 2017

, and

$70.8 million

and

$324.5 million

, respectively, as of

December 31, 2016

, was not offset against derivative assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as the amounts exceeded the net derivative positions with those counterparties. Northern Trust centrally clears certain interest rate derivative instruments as required under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

The following table presents the fair value of securities that have been either pledged to or accepted from counterparties for these derivative transactions.

TABLE 113: FAIR VALUE OF SECURITIES COLLATERAL FOR DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS

Securities pledged or accepted as collateral are not offset against derivative assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. There was no repledged or sold collateral at

December 31, 2017

or

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Certain master netting arrangements Northern Trust enters into with derivative counterparties contain credit risk-related contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare Northern Trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event Northern Trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was

$223.7 million

and

$358.2 million

at

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. Cash collateral amounts deposited with derivative counterparties on those dates included

$35.8 million

and

$317.5 million

, respectively, posted against these liabilities, resulting in a net maximum amount of termination payments that could have been required at

December 31, 2017

and


of

$187.9 million

and

$40.7 million

, respectively. Accelerated settlement of these liabilities would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of Northern Trust.

Foreign exchange contracts

are agreements to exchange specific amounts of currencies at a future date, at a specified rate of exchange. Foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to meet the foreign exchange needs of clients. Foreign exchange contracts are also used for trading purposes and risk management. For risk management purposes, Northern Trust uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates relating to certain forecasted non-functional currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions, foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, including investment securities and net investments in non-U.S. affiliates.

Interest rate contracts

include swap and option contracts. Interest rate swap contracts involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Northern Trust enters into interest rate swap contracts with its clients and also may utilize such contracts to reduce or eliminate the exposure to changes in the cash flows or fair value of hedged assets or liabilities due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate option contracts may include caps, floors, collars and swaptions, and provide for the transfer or reduction of interest rate risk, typically in exchange for a fee. Northern Trust enters into option contracts as a seller of interest rate protection to clients. Northern Trust receives a fee at the outset of the agreement for the assumption of the risk of an unfavorable change in interest rates. This assumed interest rate risk is then mitigated by entering into an offsetting position with an outside counterparty. Northern Trust may also purchase or enter into option contracts for risk management purposes including to reduce the exposure to changes in the cash flows of hedged assets due to changes in interest rates.

Client-Related and Trading Derivative Instruments.

Approximately

96%

of Northern Trust’s derivatives outstanding at

December 31, 2017

and


, measured on a notional value basis, relate to client-related and trading activities. These activities consist principally of providing foreign exchange services to clients in connection with Northern Trust’s global custody business. However, in the normal course of business, Northern Trust also engages in trading of currencies for its own account.

The following table shows the notional and fair values of client-related and trading derivative financial instruments. Notional amounts of derivative financial instruments do not represent credit risk, and are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. They are used merely to express the volume of this activity. Northern Trust’s credit-related risk of loss is limited to the positive fair value of the derivative instrument, net of any collateral received, which is significantly less than the notional amount.

Derivatives that are not formally designated as hedges under GAAP are entered into for risk management purposes. Foreign exchange contracts are entered into to manage the foreign currency risk of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, the net investment in certain non-U.S. affiliates, commercial loans, and forecasted foreign-currency-denominated transactions. Swaps related to the sale of certain Visa Class B common shares were entered into which retain the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into shares of Visa Class A common shares.  Credit default swaps were entered into to manage the credit risk associated with certain loans and loan commitments. Total return swaps are entered into to manage the equity price risk associated with certain investments.

.

All of Northern Trust’s securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) involve the transfer of financial assets in exchange for cash subject to a right and obligation to repurchase those assets for an agreed upon amount. In the event of a repurchase failure, the cash or financial assets are available for offset. All of Northern Trust’s repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are subject to a master netting arrangement, which sets forth the rights and obligations for repurchase and offset. Under the master netting arrangement, Northern Trust is entitled to set off receivables from and collateral placed with a single counterparty against obligations owed to that counterparty. In addition, collateral held by Northern Trust can be offset against receivables from that counterparty.

Derivative asset and liability positions with a single counterparty can be offset against each other in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist. Derivative assets and liabilities can be further offset by cash collateral received from, and deposited with, the transacting counterparty. The basis for this view is that,


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

upon termination of transactions subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement, the individual derivative receivables do not represent resources to which general creditors have rights and individual derivative payables do not represent claims that are equivalent to the claims of general creditors. Northern Trust centrally clears certain interest rate derivative instruments as required under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. These transactions are subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement, which has the same rights of offset as described above.

Note 27 – Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments

Commitments and Letters of Credit.

Northern Trust, in the normal course of business, enters into various types of commitments and issues letters of credit to meet the liquidity and credit enhancement needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these instruments represent the potential credit exposure should the instrument be fully drawn upon and the client default. To control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit, Northern Trust subjects such activities to the same credit quality and monitoring controls as its lending activities. Commitments and letters of credit consist of the following:

Legally Binding Commitments to Extend Credit

generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since a significant portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements.

Standby Letters of Credit

obligate Northern Trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the clients are unable to do so. These instruments are primarily issued to support public and private financial commitments, including commercial paper, bond financing, initial margin requirements on futures exchanges, and similar transactions. Northern Trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements and in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants.

Commercial Letters of Credit

are instruments issued by Northern Trust on behalf of its clients that authorize a third party (the beneficiary) to draw drafts up to a stipulated amount under the specified terms and conditions of the agreement. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily to facilitate international trade.

The following table shows the contractual amounts of commitments and letters of credit.

Other Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments.

As part of its securities custody activities and at the direction of its clients, Northern Trust lends securities owned by clients to borrowers who are reviewed and approved by the Northern Trust Capital Markets Credit Committee. In connection with these activities, Northern Trust has issued indemnifications to certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrower’s failure to return securities when due, should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral required to be posted. Borrowers are required to collateralize fully securities received with cash or marketable securities. As securities are loaned, collateral is maintained at a minimum of

100%

of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest. The collateral is revalued on a daily basis. The amount of securities loaned as of

December 31, 2017

and


subject to indemnification was

$143.6 billion

and

$102.3 billion

, respectively. Because of the credit quality of the borrowers and the requirement to fully collateralize securities borrowed, management believes that the exposure to credit loss from this activity is not significant and

no

liability was recorded related to these indemnifications.

The Bank is a participating member of various cash, securities, and foreign exchange clearing and settlement organizations such as The Depository Trust Company in New York. It participates in these organizations on behalf of its clients and on its own behalf as a result of its own activities. A wide variety of cash and securities transactions are settled through these organizations, including those involving obligations of states and political subdivisions, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, dollar placements, and securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As a result of its participation in cash, securities, and foreign exchange clearing and settlement organizations, the Bank could be responsible for a pro rata share of certain credit-related losses arising out of the clearing activities. The method in which such losses would be shared by the clearing members is stipulated in each clearing organization’s membership agreement. Credit exposure related to these agreements varies from day to day, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the volume of transactions cleared through the organizations. The estimated credit exposure at

December 31, 2017

and


was approximately

$62 million

and

$59 million

, respectively, based on the membership agreements and clearing volume for those days. Controls related to these clearing transactions are closely monitored by management to protect the assets of Northern Trust and its clients.

Note 28 – Variable Interest Entities

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) are defined within GAAP as entities which either have a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Investors that finance a VIE through debt or equity interests, or other counterparties that provide other forms of support, such as guarantees, subordinated fee arrangements, or certain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder, if any, that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the VIE’s primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.

Leveraged Leases.

In leveraged leasing transactions, Northern Trust acts as lessor of the underlying asset subject to the lease and typically funds


-

30%

of the asset’s cost via an equity ownership in a trust with the remaining


-

80%

provided by third party non-recourse debt holders. In such transactions, the trusts, which are VIEs, are created to provide the lessee use of the property with substantially all of the rights and obligations of ownership. The lessee’s maintenance and operation of the leased property has a direct effect on the fair value of the underlying property, and the lessee also has the ability to increase the benefits it can receive and limit the losses it can suffer by the manner in which it uses the property. As a result, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs given it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs.

Northern Trust’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the leveraged lease trust VIEs is limited to the carrying amounts of its leveraged lease investments. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the carrying amounts of these investments, which are included in loans and leases in the consolidated balance sheets, were

$131.0 million

and

$183.5 million

, respectively. Northern Trust’s funding requirements relative to the VIEs are limited to its invested capital. Northern Trust has

no

other liquidity arrangements or obligations to purchase assets of the VIEs that would expose Northern Trust to a loss.

Tax Credit Structures.

Northern Trust invests in qualified affordable housing projects and community development entities (collectively, community development projects) that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits. The community development projects are formed as limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which Northern Trust invests as a limited partner/investor member through equity contributions. The economic performance of the community development projects, which are VIEs, is subject to the performance of their underlying investment and their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development projects as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments. This power is held by the general partners and managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the VIEs.

Northern Trust’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with community development projects is limited to the carrying amounts of its investments, including any undrawn commitments. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the carrying amounts of these investments in community development projects that generate tax credits, included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled

$415.3 million

and

$218.9 million

, respectively, of which

$386.1 million

and

$186.5 million

are VIEs as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, liabilities related to unfunded commitments on investments in tax credit community development projects, included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled

$241.1 million

and

$82.9 million

, respectively, of which

$215.2 million

and

$56.7 million

related to undrawn commitments on VIEs as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

Northern Trust’s funding requirements are limited to its invested capital and unfunded commitments for future equity contributions. Northern Trust has

no

exposure to loss from liquidity arrangements and no obligation to purchase assets of the community development projects.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Tax credits and other tax benefits attributable to community development projects totaled

$57.9 million

and

$48.8 million

, respectively, as of

December 31, 2017

and


.

Investment Funds.

Northern Trust acts as asset manager for various funds in which clients of Northern Trust are investors. As an asset manager of funds, Northern Trust earns a competitively priced fee that is based on assets managed and varies with each fund’s investment objective. Based on its analysis, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs under GAAP.

Some of the funds for which Northern Trust acts as asset manager comply or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds and therefore the funds are exempt from the consolidation requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 810-10.

Note 30 – Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends and Loans or Advances

Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to the Corporation without regulatory approval. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for payment of any dividend by a state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding

two years

. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its “undivided profits,” as defined, without regulatory and stockholder approval.

Under Illinois law, an Illinois state bank, prior to paying a dividend, must carry over to surplus at least one-tenth of its net profits since the date of the declaration of the last preceding dividend, until the bank’s surplus is equal to its capital. In


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

addition, an Illinois state bank may not pay any dividend in an amount greater than its net profits then on hand, after deduction of losses and bad debts (defined as debts due to a state bank on which interest is past due and unpaid for a period of

six months

or more, unless the same are well secured and in the process of collection).

The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the Bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the Bank to become undercapitalized. In addition, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The payment of dividends could, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Basel III impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends (e.g., the Corporation must include proposed dividends in the capital plan that it submits to the Federal Reserve Board and such dividends may only be declared if the Federal Reserve Board does not object to the Corporation’s capital plan).

Under federal law, financial transactions by the Bank, the Corporation’s insured banking subsidiary, with the Corporation and its affiliates that are in the form of loans or extensions of credit, investments, guarantees, derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions or purchases of assets, are restricted. Transfers of this kind to the Corporation or a nonbanking subsidiary by the Bank are limited to

10%

of the Bank’s capital and surplus with respect to any single affiliate, and to

20%

of the Bank’s capital and surplus with all affiliates in the aggregate, and are also subject to certain collateral requirements (in the case of credit transactions) and other restrictions on covered transactions. These transactions, as well as other transactions between the Bank and the Corporation or its affiliates, also must be on terms substantially the same as, or at least as favorable as, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms, or under circumstances, including credit standards, that would be offered to, or would apply to, non-affiliated companies. Other state and federal laws may limit the transfer of funds by the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries to the Corporation and certain of its affiliates.

Note 31 – Reporting Segments and Related Information

Segment Information.

Northern Trust is organized around its

two

client-focused reporting segments: C&IS and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C&IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to C&IS and Wealth Management. Income and expense associated with the Corporation’s and the Bank’s wholesale funding activities and investment portfolios, as well as certain corporate-based expense, executive level compensation and nonrecurring items are not allocated to C&IS and Wealth Management, and are reported in Northern Trust’s third reporting segment, Treasury and Other, in the tables below.

C&IS and Wealth Management results are presented to promote a greater understanding of their financial performance. The information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis as opposed to GAAP which is used for consolidated financial reporting purposes, derives from internal accounting systems that support Northern Trust’s strategic objectives and management structure. The accounting policies used for management reporting are consistent with those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

Geographic Area Information.

Northern Trust’s non-U.S. activities are primarily related to its asset servicing, asset management, foreign exchange, cash management, and commercial banking businesses. The operations of Northern Trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both U.S and non-U.S. source income and assets. Non-U.S. source income and assets are not separately identified in Northern Trust’s internal management reporting system. However, Northern Trust is required to disclose non-U.S. activities based on the domicile of the customer. Due to the complex and integrated nature of Northern Trust’s activities, it is difficult to segregate with precision revenues, expenses and assets between U.S. and non-U.S.-domiciled customers. Therefore, certain subjective estimates and assumptions have been made to allocate revenues, expenses and assets between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.

For purposes of this disclosure, all foreign exchange trading income has been allocated to non-U.S. operations. Interest expense is allocated to non-U.S. operations based on specifically matched or pooled funding. Allocations of indirect noninterest expenses, when made, are based on various methods such as time, space, and number of employees.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The table below summarizes Northern Trust’s performance based on the allocation process described above without regard to guarantors or the location of collateral.

TABLE 128: DISTRIBUTION OF TOTAL ASSETS AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE

Note: Total revenue is comprised of net interest income and noninterest income.

Note 32 – Regulatory Capital Requirements

Northern Trust and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal bank regulatory authorities. Under these requirements, banks must maintain specific ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average quarterly assets in order to be classified as “well-capitalized.” The regulatory capital requirements impose certain restrictions upon banks that meet minimum capital requirements but are not “well-capitalized” and obligate the federal bank regulatory authorities to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not maintain such minimum ratios. Such prompt corrective action could have a direct material effect on a bank’s financial statements.

As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the Bank had capital ratios above the levels required for classification as a “well-capitalized” institution and had not received any regulatory notification of a lower classification. Additionally, Northern Trust’s subsidiary banks located outside the U.S. are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, Northern Trust’s non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements. There were no conditions or events since

December 31, 2017

, that management believes have adversely affected the capital categorization of any Northern Trust subsidiary bank.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The table below provides capital ratios for the Corporation and the Bank determined by Basel III phased in requirements.

TABLE 129: RISK-BASED CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND RATIOS

(1) Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation will be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of

3 percent

.

The risk-based capital guidelines that apply to the Corporation and the Bank, commonly referred to as Basel III, are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the Basel Committee. The Basel III rules are currently being phased in, and will come into full effect by January 1, 2022.

Under the final Basel III rules, the Corporation and the Bank are required to calculate and publicly disclose risk-based capital ratios using two methodologies: an advanced approach and a standardized approach. Under the advanced approach, credit risk weighted assets (RWA) are based on internal credit models and parameters. Additionally, the advanced approach incorporates operational risk RWA. Under the standardized approach, RWA are based on supervisory prescribed risk weights that are primarily dependent on counterparty type and asset class.

As required by the Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the capital adequacy of the Corporation and the Bank is assessed based on the lower of the advanced approach or standardized approach capital ratios.

The U.S.’s implementation of Basel III has increased the minimum capital thresholds for banking organizations and tightened the standards for what qualifies as capital. The Corporation and the Bank believe their capital strength, balance sheets and business models leave them well positioned for the continued U.S. implementation of Basel III.

NON-U.S. OUTSTANDINGS

As used in this discussion and the following table, non-U.S. outstandings are cross-border outstandings as defined by the SEC. They consist of loans, securities, interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions, accrued interest and other monetary assets. Not included are letters of credit, loan commitments, and non-U.S. office local currency claims on residents. Non-U.S. outstandings related to a country are net of guarantees given by third parties resident outside the country and the value of tangible, liquid collateral held outside the country. However, transactions with branches of non-U.S. banks are included in these outstandings and are classified according to the country location of the non-U.S. bank’s head office.

Short-term interbank time deposits with non-U.S. banks represent the largest category of non-U.S. outstandings. Northern Trust actively participates in the interbank market with U.S. and non-U.S. banks.

Northern Trust places deposits with non-U.S. counterparties that have strong internal (Northern Trust) risk ratings and external credit ratings. These non-U.S. banks are approved and monitored by Northern Trust’s Capital Markets Credit Committee, which has credit authority for exposure to all non-U.S. banks and approves credit limits. This process includes financial analysis of the non-U.S. banks, use of an internal risk rating system and consideration of external market indicators. Each counterparty is reviewed at least annually and potentially more frequently based on credit fundamentals or general market conditions. Separate from the entity-specific review process, the average life to maturity of deposits with non-U.S. banks is deliberately maintained on a short-term basis in order to respond quickly to changing credit conditions. Northern Trust also utilizes certain risk mitigation tools and agreements that may reduce exposures through use of collateral and/or balance sheet netting. Additionally, the Capital Market Credit Committee oversees country-risk analyses and imposes limits to country exposure.


The following table provides information on non-U.S. outstandings by country that exceed 1.00% of Northern Trust’s assets.

ITEM 9A – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of

December 31, 2017

, the Corporation’s management, with the participation of the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of

December 31, 2017

, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of the Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance to the Corporation’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation of reliable published financial statements. This internal control includes monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified.

Management assessed the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

, based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of

December 31, 2017

, the Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements as of, and for the year ended,

December 31, 2017

, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.


REPORT

INDEPENDENT

REGISTERED

PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING

FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Northern Trust Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Corporation) internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation as of

December 31, 2017

and


, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2017

, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated

February 27, 2018

expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and

the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
