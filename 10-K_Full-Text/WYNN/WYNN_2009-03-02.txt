PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

Wynn Resorts, Limited, a Nevada corporation, was formed in June 2002, is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen A. Wynn, and is a leading
developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. We own and operate three destination casino resorts: “Wynn Las Vegas,” on the “Strip” in Las Vegas, Nevada, “Encore at Wynn Las Vegas” located adjacent to
Wynn Las Vegas, and “Wynn Macau,” located in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (“Macau”). We are also currently constructing Encore at Wynn Macau, an expansion of our Wynn Macau
resort. We review our results based on the following two segments: Wynn Las Vegas (which includes Encore at Wynn Las Vegas) and Wynn Macau. For more information on the financial results for our segments, see Item 8 “Financial
Statements”, Note 19 “Segment Information”.

Due to a number of factors affecting consumers, including a slowdown in global
economies, contracting credit markets, and reduced consumer spending, 2008 was a difficult year for the casino resort business, particularly for U.S. operations. Auto traffic into Las Vegas, airline capacity and air travel to McCarran International
Airport have declined, resulting in lower casino volumes and a reduced demand for hotel rooms. The deterioration in global economic conditions will likely continue to cause us to experience lower than historical hotel occupancy rates, room rates,
casino volumes and profitability. As a result of these factors, cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was significantly less than that generated in 2007.

The factors described above accelerated through 2008 with fourth quarter results in Las Vegas significantly weaker than 2007. Additionally, in early
2009, we have experienced cancellation and attrition of group business at greater than historical levels.

Unless the context otherwise
requires, all references herein to “Wynn Resorts,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our,” or similar terms, refer to Wynn Resorts, Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Wynn Resorts files annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments of such reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Any document Wynn Resorts files may be inspected, without charge, at the SEC’s public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20549 or at the SEC’s internet site address
at http://www.sec.gov. Information related to the operation of the SEC’s public reference room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, through our own internet address at www.wynnresorts.com, Wynn Resorts provides a
hyperlink to a third-party SEC filing website which posts these filings as soon as reasonably practicable, where they can be reviewed without charge. Information found on our website is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Resorts

Wynn Las Vegas

Wynn Las Vegas opened on April 28, 2005. We believe that the resort offers exceptional accommodations, amenities and service with 2,716 rooms and
suites, including 36 fairway villas and 6 private-entry villas for our premium guests. The Tower Suites at Wynn Las Vegas is the only casino resort in the world to receive both the Mobil five-star and AAA five-diamond distinctions. In January 2009,
The Spa at Wynn Las Vegas earned five-star recognition from Mobil and became the only spa in Las Vegas to earn such award. In addition, Wynn Las Vegas was recognized for the second year in a row by Michelin, the esteemed European restaurant rating
system. In October 2008, three of our restaurants were awarded Michelin stars. Two Michelin stars were awarded to

Alex

and one Michelin star was awarded to each of Wing Lei and Daniel Boulud Brasserie. Our resort also received five red
pavilions, the highest honor for Michelin rated accommodations.



The approximately 111,000 square foot casino features approximately 135 table games, a baccarat salon,
private VIP gaming rooms, a poker room, approximately 1,935 slot machines, and a race and sports book. The resort’s 22 food and beverage outlets feature six fine dining restaurants, including restaurants helmed by award winning chefs. Wynn
Las Vegas also offers two nightclubs, a spa and salon, a Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership, wedding chapels, an 18-hole golf course, approximately 223,000 square feet of meeting space and an approximately 74,000 square foot retail promenade
featuring boutiques from Alexander McQueen, Brioni, Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Graff, Louis Vuitton, Manolo Blahnik, Oscar de la Renta and Vertu. Wynn Las Vegas also has a showroom which features “Le Rêve,” a water-based theatrical
production. We believe that the unique experience of Wynn Las Vegas drives the significant visitation experienced since opening.

Encore
at Wynn Las Vegas

Encore at Wynn Las Vegas opened on December 22, 2008. This resort is located immediately adjacent to and is
connected with Wynn Las Vegas and features a 2,034 all-suite hotel as well as an approximately 72,000 square foot casino with approximately 95 table games, a baccarat salon, private VIP gaming rooms, approximately 835 slot machines and a sports
book. The resort’s 12 food and beverage outlets include five restaurants, many of which feature award winning chefs. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas also offers a night club, a spa and salon, approximately 60,000 square feet of meeting space and
approximately 27,000 square feet of upscale retail outlets featuring boutiques from Hermes, Chanel and Rock & Republic. The Encore Theater, featuring Danny Gans, opened on February 10, 2009.

Wynn Macau

Wynn Macau opened on
September 6, 2006. Wynn Macau currently features approximately 600 hotel rooms and suites, approximately 370 table games, approximately 1,250 slot machines and a poker room in approximately 205,000 square feet of casino gaming space, five
restaurants, a spa and salon, lounges, meeting facilities and approximately 46,000 square feet of retail space featuring boutiques from Bvlgari, Chanel, Dior, Dunhill, Fendi, Ferrari, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Hermes, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu,
Piaget, Prada, Rolex, Tiffany, Van Cleef & Arpels, Versace, Vertu and Zegna. In November 2008, Wynn Macau was the only hotel in Macau, and one of only five hotels in Asia, to receive the Mobil five-star distinction. The Spa at Wynn Macau
also received the Mobil five-star award. Wynn Macau includes a show in its rotunda featuring a Chinese zodiac-inspired ceiling and an interchangeable gold “prosperity tree” and a “dragon of fortune”.

Construction and Development

Encore at Wynn Macau

We have commenced construction of Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau. Encore at Wynn Macau will add a
fully-integrated resort hotel to Wynn Macau, planned to include approximately 400 luxury suites and four villas along with restaurants, additional retail space and additional VIP gaming space. While the completed project budget is still being
finalized, we expect total costs to be approximately $700 million. We expect Encore at Wynn Macau to open in 2010. As of December 31, 2008, we had incurred approximately $202 million related to the development and construction of Encore at Wynn
Macau.

General

In the
ordinary course of our business, in response to market developments and customer preferences, we have made and continue to make certain enhancements and refinements to our properties. We have incurred and will continue to incur these capital
expenditures at Wynn Las Vegas, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau.

Other Development Opportunities

Approximately 142 acres of land comprising Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas is currently improved with a golf course. While we may develop this
property in the future; due to the current economic environment and certain restrictions in our credit facilities, we have no immediate plans to develop this property.



We have applied to the government of Macau for a land concession for approximately 52 acres on Cotai and
are awaiting final governmental approval of this concession. Due to the current economic environment, no construction timeline or budget have yet been developed.

We continually seek out new opportunities for additional gaming or related businesses, in Las Vegas, other markets in the United States and worldwide.

Our Strategy

We believe that Steve Wynn is the preeminent designer, developer and operator of
destination casino resorts and has developed brand name status. Mr. Wynn’s involvement with our casino resorts provides a distinct advantage over other gaming enterprises. We integrate luxurious surroundings, distinctive entertainment and
superior amenities, including fine dining and premium retail offerings, to create resorts that appeal to a variety of customers.

Our
properties were designed and built to provide a premium experience. We seek to position Wynn Las Vegas, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau as full-service luxury resorts and casinos in the leisure, convention and tour and travel industries. We
market these resorts directly to gaming customers using database marketing techniques, as well as traditional incentives, including reduced room rates and complimentary meals and suites. Our rewards system offers discounted and complimentary meals,
lodging and entertainment for our guests. We also create general market awareness for our properties through various media channels, including television, radio, newspapers, magazines, the internet, direct mail and billboards.

Mr. Wynn and his team bring significant experience in designing, developing and operating casino resorts. The senior executive team has an average
of approximately 25 years of experience in the hotel and gaming industries. We also have an approximately 70-person design, development and construction subsidiary, the senior management of which has significant experience in all major construction
disciplines.

Market and Competition

Las Vegas

Las Vegas is the largest gaming market in the United States. The casino/hotel industry in Las Vegas is highly
competitive and, prior to the recent economic conditions and interruption in projects under development, had undergone a period of exceptional growth, particularly with the addition of projects targeting the premium customer. Wynn Las Vegas and
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas are located on the Las Vegas Strip and compete with these and other high-quality resorts and hotel casinos, those in downtown Las Vegas, as well as a large number of hotels in and near Las Vegas. Many competing properties,
such as the Bellagio, Caesars Palace, Luxor Hotel and Casino, Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino, The Mirage, New York-New York Hotel and Casino, Paris Las Vegas, Treasure Island, The Venetian, The Palazzo and others, have themes and attractions
which draw a significant number of visitors and directly compete with our operations. We seek to differentiate Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas from other major Las Vegas resorts by concentrating on our fundamental elements of design,
atmosphere, personal service and luxury.

Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas may face additional competition from new
multi-billion dollar resorts that are expected to open on the Las Vegas Strip before the end of 2010 including, without limitation, City Center, Fontainebleau Las Vegas and Cosmopolitan. There are several other large projects under development in
Las Vegas which have been delayed or may be delayed.

The addition of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas’ 2,034 suites also creates competition
for Wynn Las Vegas. While we are attempting to differentiate the product, at this time, we are uncertain how our customers will value the properties on a relative basis.



Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas also compete, to some extent, with other hotel/casino
facilities in Nevada and Atlantic City, riverboat gaming facilities in other states, casino facilities on Native American lands and elsewhere in the world, as well as state lotteries and other forms of gaming. The proliferation of Native American
gaming in California could have a negative impact on our operations. In particular, the legalization of casino gaming in or near metropolitan areas from which we attract customers could have a negative effect on our business. In addition, new or
renovated casinos in Macau, including our properties in Macau, or elsewhere in Asia could draw Asian gaming customers, including “highrollers”, away from Las Vegas.

Reflecting the current economic environment, the Las Vegas gaming and hotel markets experienced the first decline in trends in five years during 2008
with, among other things, a 4.4% decrease in visitation to 37.5 million visitors, a 10.6% decrease in Las Vegas Strip gaming revenue and a 9.8% decrease in average daily room rates, all as compared to the year ended December 2007. We, along
with our competitors, have responded to the deterioration in consumer spending by aggressively marketing and pricing our Las Vegas offerings.

Macau

Macau, which was a Portuguese colony for approximately 450 years, was transferred from Portuguese to Chinese
political control in December 1999. Macau is governed as a special administrative region of China and is located approximately 37 miles southwest of, and less than one hour away via ferry from, Hong Kong. Macau, which has been a casino destination
for more than 40 years, consists principally of a peninsula on mainland China, and two neighboring islands, Taipa and Coloane, connected by bridges. We believe that Macau is located in one of the world’s largest concentrations of potential
gaming customers. According to Macau Statistical Information, casinos in Macau generated approximately $13.6 billion in gaming revenue in 2008, a 31% increase over the $10.3 billion generated in 2007, making Macau the largest gaming market in the
world.

Macau’s gaming market is primarily dependent on tourists. The Macau market has experienced tremendous growth in capacity in
the last few years. As of December 31, 2008, there were approximately 17,490 hotel rooms and approximately 4,000 table games in Macau, compared to approximately 12,978 hotel rooms and approximately 2,760 table games as of December 31,
2006.

Gaming customers traveling to Macau have typically come from nearby destinations in Asia including Hong Kong, mainland China,
Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, approximately 90% of the tourists who visited Macau in 2008 came from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Macau completed
construction of an international airport in 1995, which accommodates large commercial aircraft and provides direct air service to major cities in Asia, including Beijing, Shanghai, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, Taipei, Manila, Singapore and Bangkok.
Travel to Macau by citizens of mainland China requires a visa. Adjustments to the visa policy were made in 2008 restricting the frequency of visitation. Government officials have the authority to further adjust the visa policy and may do so in the
future.

Prior to 2002, gaming in Macau was permitted as a government-sanctioned monopoly concession awarded to a single concessionaire.
However, the government of Macau liberalized the gaming industry in 2002 by granting concessions to operate casinos to three concessionaires (including Wynn Macau), who in turn were permitted, subject to the approval of the government of Macau, to
each grant one sub-concession to other gaming operators. There is no limit to the number of casinos each concessionaire is permitted to operate, but each facility is subject to government approval. Currently, there are 31 operating casinos in Macau.

The other two concessions were granted to Sociedade de Jogos de Macau (“SJM”) and Galaxy Casino Company, Limited
(“Galaxy”). SJM, which is controlled by Stanley Ho, operates 19 of the 31 existing casinos, including two of the larger casinos in Macau: the Hotel Lisboa and The Grand Lisboa. In addition, an affiliate of SJM owns most of the water ferry
services and the helicopter shuttle service that link Macau to Hong Kong.



Galaxy was also awarded a casino concession in June 2002. Galaxy is a company controlled by Hong Kong
businessman Lui Chi-woo and a group of Hong Kong investors. Galaxy opened the Waldo Hotel/Casino on the Macau peninsula in 2004, the Grand Waldo Cotai in the summer of 2006, and Galaxy Star World hotel casino immediately adjacent to Wynn Macau in
October 2006.

Las Vegas Sands Corp., the owner and operator of The Venetian and The Palazzo resorts in Las Vegas and a former partner of
Galaxy, has entered into a sub-concession agreement with Galaxy which allows it to independently develop and operate casinos in Macau. The Sands Macao opened in 2004. In August 2007, Las Vegas Sands Corp. opened the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel, the
largest casino resort in Macau. In August 2008, Las Vegas Sands Corp. opened the Four Seasons Hotel Macau adjacent to the Venetian Macao. In addition, Las Vegas Sands Corp. has proposed a masterplan for other large developments in Cotai that would
include additional hotel properties as well as serviced apartment units and additional retail and related space. In late 2008, Las Vegas Sands Corp. suspended further development of its Cotai masterplan as a result of conditions in the global
economy and credit markets.

A joint venture consisting of Melco, a Hong Kong stock exchange-listed company and Crown, Ltd., an Australian
company, is currently operating the Crown Macau (which opened in May 2007) and is constructing the City of Dreams, a large resort in Cotai, the first phase of which is anticipated to open in 2009. This joint venture operates its properties under a
subconcession purchased from us.

In December 2007, a joint venture of MGM MIRAGE and Pansy Ho Chiu-king (Stanley Ho’s daughter)
opened the MGM Grand Macau, a resort on the Macau peninsula adjacent to Wynn Macau. The MGM Grand Macau is operated pursuant to a subconcession granted to the joint venture by SJM.

Our casino concession agreement allows the government to grant additional concessions for the operation of casinos after April 1, 2009. If the
government of Macau awards additional concessions or permits additional sub-concessionaires, Wynn Macau will face increased competition from casino operators in Macau.

Wynn Macau also faces competition from casinos located in other areas of Asia, such as Genting Highlands Resort, a major gaming and resort destination located outside of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and casinos in the
Philippines. Two large-scale casinos that are being developed currently in Singapore will add further competition to the region. Wynn Macau also encounters competition from other major gaming centers located around the world, including Australia and
Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming and other casinos throughout Asia.

Geographic Data

Geographic data are reported in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional financial data about our geographic operations is provided in
Item 7 “Management’s Discussion of Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Regulation and Licensing

The gaming industry is highly regulated. Gaming registrations, licenses and approvals, once obtained, can be suspended or revoked for a
variety of reasons. We cannot assure you that we will obtain all required registrations, licenses and approvals on a timely basis or at all, or that, once obtained, the registrations, findings of suitability, licenses and approvals will not be
suspended, conditioned, limited or revoked. If we are ever prohibited from operating one of our gaming facilities, we would, to the extent permitted by law, seek to recover our investment by selling the property affected, but we cannot assure you
that we could recover full value.



Nevada

Introduction.

The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations made under the Act, as well as to various
local ordinances. Wynn Las Vegas’ operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission, the Nevada State Gaming Control Board and the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board, which we refer to
herein collectively as the “Nevada Gaming Authorities.”

Policy Concerns of Gaming Laws.

The laws,
regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy. Such public policy concerns include, among other things:

•

preventing unsavory or unsuitable persons from being directly or indirectly involved with gaming at any time or in any capacity;

•

establishing and maintaining responsible accounting practices and procedures;

•

maintaining effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and safeguarding
assets and revenue, providing reliable recordkeeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities;

•

preventing cheating and fraudulent practices; and

•

providing a source of state and local revenue through taxation and licensing fees.

Changes in applicable laws, regulations and procedures could have significant negative effects on our Las Vegas gaming operations and our financial
condition and results of operations.

Owner and Operator Licensing Requirements.

Our subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC,
as the owner and operator of Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, has been approved by the Nevada Gaming Authorities as a limited liability company licensee, referred to as a company licensee, which includes approval to conduct casino gaming
operations, including a race book and sports pool and pari-mutuel wagering. These gaming licenses are not transferable.

Company
Registration Requirements.

Wynn Resorts was found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Commission to own the equity interests of Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC (“Wynn Resorts Holdings”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, and
to be registered by the Nevada Gaming Commission as a publicly traded corporation, referred to as a registered company, for the purposes of the Nevada Gaming Control Act. Wynn Resorts Holdings was found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Commission to
own the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and to be registered by the Nevada Gaming Commission as an intermediary company. In addition to being licensed, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, as an issuer of First Mortgage Notes registered with the SEC, also
qualified as a registered company. Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp., a co-issuer of the First Mortgage Notes, was not required to be registered or licensed, but may be required to be found suitable as a lender or financing source.

Periodically, we are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Gaming Commission and provide any other information that
the Nevada Gaming Commission may require. Substantially all of our material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must be reported to, and/or approved by, the Nevada Gaming Commission.

Individual Licensing Requirements.

No person may become a stockholder or member of, or receive any percentage of the profits of, an
intermediary company or company licensee without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to or material involvement with
us to determine whether the individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming licensee. Certain of our officers, directors and key employees



have been or may be required to file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and are or may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the
Nevada Gaming Authorities. All applications required as of the date of this report have been filed. However, the Nevada Gaming Authorities may require additional applications and may also deny an application for licensing for any reason, which they
deem appropriate. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. An applicant for licensing or an applicant for a finding of
suitability must pay or must cause to be paid all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability
or licensing, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have the jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.

If the Nevada Gaming
Authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the Nevada Gaming Commission may
require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability or questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to judicial review in Nevada.

Redemption of Securities Owned By an Unsuitable Person.

Wynn Resorts’ articles of incorporation provide that, to the extent a
gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by the board of directors, Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its
affiliates. The redemption price will be the amount, if any, required by the gaming authority or, if the gaming authority does not determine the price, the sum deemed by the board of directors to be the fair value of the securities to be redeemed.
If Wynn Resorts determines the redemption price, the redemption price will be capped at the closing price of the shares on the principal national securities exchange on which the shares are listed on the trading day before the redemption notice is
given. If the shares are not listed on a national securities exchange, the redemption price will be capped at the closing sale price of the shares as quoted on The NASDAQ Global Select Market or if the closing price is not reported, the mean between
the bid and asked prices, as quoted by any other generally recognized reporting system. Wynn Resorts’ right of redemption is not exclusive of any other rights that it may have or later acquire under any agreement, its bylaws or otherwise. The
redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note, or both, as required, and pursuant to the terms established by, the applicable Gaming Authority and, if not, as Wynn Resorts elects.

Consequences of Violating Gaming Laws.

If the Nevada Gaming Commission determines that we have violated the Nevada Gaming
Control Act or any of its regulations, it could limit, condition, suspend or revoke our registrations and gaming license. In addition, we and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Gaming
Control Act, or of the regulations of the Nevada Gaming Commission, at the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Further, the Nevada Gaming Commission could appoint a supervisor to operate Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and, under
specified circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor’s appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the premises) could be forfeited to the State of Nevada. Limitation, conditioning or suspension of any of our gaming
licenses and the appointment of a supervisor could, and revocation of any gaming license would, have a significant negative effect on our gaming operations.

Requirements for Voting or Nonvoting Securities Holders.

Regardless of the number of shares held, any beneficial owner of Wynn Resorts’ voting or nonvoting securities may be required to file
an application, be investigated and have that person’s suitability as a beneficial owner of voting securities determined if the Nevada Gaming Commission has reason to believe that the ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies
of the State of Nevada. If the beneficial owner of the voting or nonvoting securities of Wynn Resorts who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust, it must submit detailed business
and financial information including a list of its beneficial owners. The applicant must pay all costs of the investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any investigation.



The Nevada Gaming Control Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of the voting securities of a
registered company to report the acquisition to the Nevada Gaming Commission. The Nevada Gaming Control Act requires beneficial owners of more than 10% of a registered company’s voting securities to apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a
finding of suitability within 30 days after the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board mails the written notice requiring such filing. Under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor,” as defined in the Nevada
Gaming Control Act, which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 15%, of the registered company’s voting securities may apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a waiver of a finding of suitability if the institutional investor holds the
voting securities for investment purposes only. In certain circumstances, an institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may hold up to 19% of a registered company’s voting securities for a limited period of time and maintain the waiver.
An institutional investor will not be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of
causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors of the registered company, a change in the corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered company, or any of its
gaming affiliates, or any other action which the Nevada Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered company’s voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities which are not deemed to be inconsistent with
holding voting securities for investment purposes only include:

•

voting on all matters voted on by stockholders or interest holders;

•

making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in
management, policies or operations; and,

•

other activities that the Nevada Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.

The articles of incorporation of Wynn Resorts include provisions intended to assist its implementation of the above restrictions.

Wynn Resorts is required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada which may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any
securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to make the disclosure may be grounds for finding the record
holder unsuitable. We are required to provide maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner of any of Wynn Resorts’ voting securities. The Nevada Gaming Commission has the power to require the stock certificates of any
registered company to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act. The certificates representing shares of Wynn Resorts’ common stock note that the shares are subject to a right of redemption and
other restrictions set forth in Wynn Resorts’ articles of incorporation and bylaws and that the shares are, or may become, subject to restrictions imposed by applicable gaming laws.

Consequences of Being Found Unsuitable.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within
30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Gaming Commission or by the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in connection
with the investigation of its application, may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or
indirectly, any beneficial ownership of any voting security or debt security of a registered company beyond the period of time as may be prescribed by the Nevada Gaming Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. We will be subject to
disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to hold an equity interest or to have any other relationship with us, we:

•

pay that person any dividend or interest upon any voting securities;

•

allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right held by that person relating to Wynn Resorts;



•

pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or,

•

fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to relinquish such person’s voting securities including, if necessary, the immediate
purchase of the voting securities for cash at fair market value.

Gaming Laws Relating to Debt Securities
Ownership.

The Nevada Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require the owner of any debt or similar securities of a registered company, to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt or other security of the
registered company if the Nevada Gaming Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. If the Nevada Gaming Commission decides that a person is unsuitable to
own the security, then under the Nevada Gaming Control Act, the registered company can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission, it:

•

pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest or any distribution whatsoever;

•

recognizes any voting right by the unsuitable person in connection with the securities;

•

pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or,

•

makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction.

Approval of Public Offerings.

We may not make a public offering without the prior approval of
the Nevada Gaming Commission if the proceeds from the offering are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes or for similar transactions. On
March 22, 2007, the Nevada Gaming Commission granted us and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC prior approval, subject to certain conditions, to make public offerings for a period of two years (the “Shelf Approval”). The Shelf Approval also applies
to any affiliated company wholly owned by us which is a publicly traded corporation or would thereby become a publicly traded corporation pursuant to a public offering. The Shelf Approval may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the
issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board. The Shelf Approval does not constitute a finding, recommendation or approval by any of the Nevada Gaming Authorities as to the accuracy or adequacy of
the offering memorandum or the investment merits of the securities. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful. We have applied for a new Shelf Approval which is scheduled to be heard in March 2009.

Approval of Changes in Control.

A registered company must obtain the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission with respect to
a change in control through merger; consolidation; stock or asset acquisitions; management or consulting agreements; or any act or conduct by a person by which the person obtains control of the registered company.

Entities seeking to acquire control of a registered company must satisfy the Nevada State Gaming Control Board and Nevada Gaming Commission with respect
to a variety of stringent standards before assuming control of the registered company. The Nevada Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with
the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.

Approval of Defensive Tactics.

The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Nevada corporate gaming
licensees or affecting registered companies that are affiliated with the operations of Nevada gaming licensees may be harmful to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Nevada Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to reduce the
potential adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada’s gaming industry and to further Nevada’s policy in order to:

•

assure the financial stability of corporate gaming licensees and their affiliated companies;



•

preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and,

•

promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

Approvals may be required from the Nevada Gaming Commission before a registered company can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above its
current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Nevada Gaming Control Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by a registered company’s board of directors in
response to a tender offer made directly to its stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control.

Fees and Taxes.

License
fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the counties and cities in which the licensed subsidiaries’ respective operations are conducted. Depending
upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon:

•

a percentage of the gross revenue received;

•

the number of gaming devices operated; or,

•

the number of table games operated.

A live entertainment tax also is imposed on admission charges and sales of food, beverages and merchandise where live entertainment is furnished.

Foreign Gaming Investigations.

Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered in Nevada, or is under common control with such persons (collectively,
“licensees”), and who proposes to become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada, is required to deposit with the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000 to pay the
expenses of investigation of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board of the licensee’s or registrant’s participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Gaming
Commission. Licensees and registrants are required to comply with the foreign gaming reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Gaming Control Act. A licensee or registrant is also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Gaming Commission if
it:

•

knowingly violates any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation;

•

fails to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;

•

engages in any activity or enters into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects or
tends to reflect, discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada;

•

engages in activities or enters into associations that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees; or,

•

employs, contracts with or associates with a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of
unsuitability.

Licenses for Conduct of Gaming and Sale of Alcoholic Beverages.

The conduct of gaming
activities and the service and sale of alcoholic beverages at Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas are subject to licensing, control and regulation by the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board, which has granted Wynn Las Vegas, LLC
licenses for such purposes. In addition to approving Wynn Las Vegas, LLC the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board has the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of any corporation controlling a gaming license.
Clark County gaming and liquor licenses are not transferable. The County has full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license. Any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a substantial negative impact upon our operations.



Macau

General.

As a casino concessionaire, Wynn Macau, S.A. is subject to the regulatory control of the Government of Macau. The government has adopted Laws and Administrative Regulations governing the
operation of casinos in Macau. Only concessionaires or subconcessionaires are permitted to operate casinos. Subconcessions may be awarded subject to the approval of the Macau government and, to date, each concessionaire has issued one subconcession.
Each concessionaire was required to enter into a concession agreement with the Macau government which, together with the Law and Administrative Regulations, forms the framework for the regulation of the activities of the concessionaire.

Under the Law and Administrative Regulations, concessionaires are subject to suitability requirements relating to background, associations and
reputation, as are stockholders of 5% or more of a concessionaire’s equity securities, officers, directors and key employees. The same requirements apply to any entity engaged by a concessionaire to manage casino operations. Concessionaires are
required to satisfy minimum capitalization requirements, demonstrate and maintain adequate financial capacity to operate the concession and submit to continuous monitoring of their casino operations by the Macau government. Concessionaires also are
subject to periodic financial reporting requirements and reporting obligations with respect to, among other things, certain contracts, financing activities and transactions with directors, financiers and key employees. Transfers or the encumbering
of interests in concessionaires must be reported to the Macau government and are ineffective without government approval.

Each
concessionaire is required to engage an executive director who must be a permanent resident of Macau and the holder of at least 10% of the capital stock of the concessionaire. The appointment of the executive director and of any successor is
ineffective without the approval of the Macau government. All contracts placing the management of a concessionaire’s casino operations with a third party also are ineffective without the approval of the Macau government.

Concessionaires are subject to a special gaming tax of 35% of gross gaming revenue, and must also make an annual contribution of up to 4% of gross gaming
revenue for the promotion of public interests, social security, infrastructure and tourism. Concessionaires are obligated to withhold, according to the rate in effect as set by the government, from any commissions paid to games promoters. Such
withholding rate may be adjusted from time to time.

A games promoter, also known as a junket representative, is a person who, for the
purpose of promoting casino gaming activity, arranges customer transportation and accommodations, and provides credit in their sole discretion, food and beverage services and entertainment in exchange for commissions or other compensation from a
concessionaire. Macau law provides that games promoters must be licensed by the Macau government in order to do business with and receive compensation from concessionaires. For a license to be obtained, direct and indirect owners of 5% or more of a
games promoter (regardless of its corporate form or sole proprietor status), its directors and its key employees must be found suitable. Applicants are required to pay the cost of license investigations, and are required to maintain suitability
standards during the period of licensure. The term of a games promoters license is one calendar year, and licenses can be renewed for additional periods upon the submission of renewal applications. Natural person junket representative licensees are
subject to a suitability verification process every three years and business entity licensees are subject to the same requirement every six years.

Under Macau law, licensed games promoters must identify outside contractors who assist them in their promotion activities. These contractors are subject to approval of the Macau government. Changes in the management structure of business
entity games promoters licensees must be reported to the Macau government and any transfer or the encumbering of interests in such licensees is ineffective without prior government approval. To conduct gaming promotion activities licensees must be
registered with one or more concessionaires and must have written contracts with such concessionaires, copies of which must be submitted to the Macau government.



Macau law further provides that concessionaires are jointly responsible with their games promoters for
the activities of such representatives and their directors and contractors in the concessionaires’ casinos, and for their compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Concessionaires must submit annual lists of their games promoters for the
following year, and must update such lists on a quarterly basis. The Macau government may designate a maximum number of games promoters and specify the number of games promoters a concessionaire is permitted to engage. Concessionaires are subject to
periodic reporting requirements with respect to commissions paid to their games promoters representatives and are required to oversee their activities and report instances of unlawful activity.

The government of Macau may assume temporary custody and control over the operation of a concession in certain circumstances. During any such period, the
costs of operations must be borne by the concessionaire. The government of Macau also may redeem a concession starting at an established date after the entering into effect of a concession. The government of Macau also may terminate a concession for
cause, including, without limitation, failure of the concessionaire to fulfill its obligations under law or the concession contract.

Concession Agreement.

The concession agreement between Wynn Macau S.A. and the Macau government required Wynn Macau, S.A. to construct and operate one or more casino gaming properties in Macau, including, at a minimum, one
full-service casino resort by the end of December 2006, and to invest not less than a total of 4 billion patacas (approximately US$500 million) in Macau-related projects by June 2009. This obligation was satisfied upon the opening of Wynn Macau.

Wynn Macau, S.A. was also obligated to obtain, and did obtain, a 700 million pataca (approximately US$87 million) bank guarantee
from Banco National Ultramarino, S.A. (“BNU”) that was effective until March 31, 2007. The amount of this guarantee was reduced to 300 million patacas (approximately US$37 million) for the period from April 1, 2007
until 180 days after the end of the term of the concession agreement. This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures Wynn Macau, S.A.’s performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of
premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform the concession agreement. Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated, upon demand by BNU, to promptly repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. BNU is currently paid an annual
fee by Wynn Macau, S.A. for the guarantee not to exceed 5.2 million patacas (approximately US$0.7 million).

The government of Macau
may redeem the concession beginning on June 24, 2017, and in such event Wynn Macau, S.A. will be entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue
generated during the tax year prior to the redemption multiplied for the remaining years under the concession.

The government of Macau may
unilaterally rescind the concession if Wynn Macau, S.A. fails to fulfill its fundamental obligations under the concession agreement. The concession agreement expressly provides that the government of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession
agreement if Wynn Macau, S.A.:

•

conducts unauthorized games or activities that are excluded from its corporate purpose;

•

abandons or suspends gaming operations in Macau for more than seven consecutive days (or more than 14 days in a civil year) without justification;

•

defaults in payment of taxes, premiums, contributions or other required amounts;

•

does not comply with government inspections or supervision;

•

systematically fails to observe its obligations under the concession system;

•

fails to maintain bank guarantees or bonds satisfactory to the government;

•

is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or becomes insolvent;

•

engages in serious fraudulent activity, damaging to the public interest; or,

•

repeatedly and seriously violates applicable gaming laws.



If the government of Macau unilaterally rescinds the concession agreement for one of the reasons stated
above, Wynn Macau, S.A. will be required to compensate the government in accordance with applicable law, and the areas defined as casino under Macau law and all of the gaming equipment pertaining to the gaming operations of Wynn Macau will be
transferred to the government without compensation. In addition, the government of Macau may, in the public interest, unilaterally terminate the concession at any time, in which case Wynn Macau, S.A. would be entitled to reasonable compensation.

Seasonality

We may experience
fluctuations in revenues and cash flows from month to month, however, we do not believe that our business is materially impacted by seasonality.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we had a total of approximately 20,600 employees (including approximately 7,200 in
Macau).

During 2006, we entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the Culinary and Bartenders Union local that covers
approximately 6,300 employees at Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. In May 2007, the dealers at Wynn Las Vegas elected the Transportation Workers Union to represent them. We are currently negotiating a contract with the Transportation
Workers Union. Certain other unions may seek to organize the workers at Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. Unionization, pressure to unionize, or other forms of collective bargaining could increase our labor costs.

We recruited a substantial number of new employees for the opening of Wynn Macau and the success of our operations will be affected by our success in
retaining them. Wynn Macau competes with the large number of new casino resort developments currently underway in Macau and expected in the near future for the limited qualified employees. We will have to seek employees from other countries to
adequately staff Wynn Macau. Recent policies announced publicly by the Macau government have affected our ability to import labor in certain job classifications. We are coordinating with the Macau labor and immigration authorities to ensure our
labor demand is satisfied, but cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees for our Wynn Macau operations or that we will be able to obtain required work permits for those employees.

Intellectual Property

Our most
important marks are our trademarks and service marks that use the name “WYNN”. Wynn Resorts has filed applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”), to register a variety of the WYNN-related trademarks and
service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. These marks include “WYNN RESORTS”, “WYNN DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT”, “WYNN LAS VEGAS”, “ENCORE” and “WYNN MACAU”. Some of the
applications are based upon ongoing use and others are based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks in the future.

A common element of
most of these marks is the use of the surname, “WYNN”. As a general rule, a surname (or a mark primarily constituting a surname) is not registerable unless the surname has acquired “secondary meaning.” To date, Wynn Resorts has
been successful in demonstrating to the PTO such secondary meaning for the Wynn name in certain of the applications based upon Mr. Wynn’s prominence as a resort developer.

Federal registrations are not completely dispositive of the right to such marks. Third parties who claim prior rights with respect to similar marks may
nonetheless challenge our right to obtain registrations or our use of the marks and seek to overcome the presumptions afforded by such registrations.



We have also filed applications with various foreign patent and trademark registries including registries
in Macau, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, certain European countries and various other jurisdictions throughout the world to register a variety of WYNN-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and
services. These marks include many of the same marks filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and include “WYNN MACAU”, “WYNN LAS VEGAS” and “ENCORE”. Some of the applications are based upon ongoing use
and others are based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks in the future.

We recognize that our intellectual property assets,
especially the logo version of “WYNN”, are among our most valuable assets. As a result, and in connection with expansion of our resorts and gaming activities outside the United States, we have undertaken a program to register our
trademarks and other intellectual property rights in all relevant jurisdictions. We have retained counsel and intend to take all steps necessary to protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized use throughout the world.

On August 6, 2004, we entered into agreements with Mr. Wynn that confirm and clarify our rights to use the “Wynn” name and
Mr. Wynn’s persona in connection with our casino resorts. Under a Surname Rights Agreement, Mr. Wynn has granted us an exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual, worldwide license to use, and to own and register trademarks and service marks
incorporating, the “Wynn” name for casino resorts and related businesses, together with the right to sublicense the name and marks to our affiliates. Under a Rights of Publicity License, Mr. Wynn has granted us the exclusive,
royalty-free, worldwide right to use his full name, persona and related rights of publicity for casino resorts and related businesses, together with the ability to sublicense the persona and publicity rights to our affiliates, until October 24,
2017.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The following risk factors, among
others, could cause our financial performance to differ significantly from the goals, plans, objectives, intentions and expectations expressed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks and uncertainties or other risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or not currently considered to be material actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed substantially.

Risks Related to our Substantial Indebtedness

We are highly leveraged and future cash
flow may not be sufficient for us to meet our obligations, and we might have difficulty obtaining more financing.

We have a
substantial amount of consolidated debt in relation to our equity. As of December 31, 2008, we had total outstanding debt of approximately $4.3 billion. In addition, our Wynn Las Vegas credit agreement permits us to incur additional
indebtedness in connection with potential expansion plans under certain circumstances in the future and the Wynn Macau credit facilities permit us to incur additional indebtedness if certain conditions are met. Our substantial indebtedness could
have important consequences. For example:

•

if we fail to meet our payment obligations or otherwise default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, the lenders under those agreements will have the
right to accelerate the indebtedness and exercise other rights and remedies against us. These rights and remedies include rights to:

•

repossess and foreclose upon the assets that serve as collateral;

•

initiate judicial foreclosure against us; and

•

petition a court to appoint a receiver for us or for substantially all of our assets.

•

If we default under either our Wynn Las Vegas or Wynn Macau credit facilities, such an event will cause a default under our Wynn Resorts credit agreement;

•

we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas to service and amortize our Wynn
Las Vegas indebtedness and to pay final construction and retention payables for Encore at Wynn Las Vegas (approximately $202 million at December 31, 2008), which will reduce the amount of available cash, if any, to fund working capital, other
capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, and may give us greater exposure to the current adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

we may experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels due to the adverse economic and industry conditions,
and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs and/or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject to under our existing indebtedness. We cannot provide assurance that our business
will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs;

•

we are dependent on certain amounts of cash flow from Wynn Macau to service the indebtedness associated with the Wynn Resorts term loan and Wynn Macau’s
indebtedness, which reduces the available cash flow to fund working capital, other capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes at Wynn Macau;

•

we may have a limited ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to withstand competitive pressures, which may affect our financial
condition;

•

we may not be able to obtain additional financing, if needed, to fund construction costs of Encore at Wynn Macau, satisfy working capital requirements including
final construction and retention payables related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, or pay for other capital expenditures, debt service or other obligations;



•

while we do hedge a certain amount of our debt under our credit facilities, rates with respect to a portion of the interest we pay will fluctuate with market rates
and, accordingly, our interest expense will increase if market interest rates increase; and

•

if we fail to pay our debts generally as they become due, unsecured creditors that we fail to pay may initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against us,
subject to the requirements of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and such bankruptcy proceedings will delay or impact the repayment of our secured debt.

Under the terms of the documents governing our debt facilities, we may, subject to certain limitations, be permitted to incur additional indebtedness,
including secured senior and subordinated indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above will be exacerbated.

The agreements governing our debt facilities contain certain financial covenants and other covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic
conditions.

Our debt facilities require us to satisfy various financial covenants, which include requirements for minimum interest
coverage ratios and ratios pertaining to total debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. If our operations fail to generate adequate cash flow, we may violate those covenants causing a default in our agreements. Future
indebtedness or other contracts could contain covenants more restrictive than those contained in our existing debt facilities.

Our ability
to comply with the terms of our outstanding facilities may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions and other events, some of which may be beyond our control. As a result, we may not be able to maintain compliance with these
covenants. Our failure to comply with the terms of our debt facilities, including failure as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results and our
financial condition or result in our lenders taking action to enforce their security interests in our various assets.

The agreements
governing our debt facilities also contain restrictions on our ability to engage in certain transactions and may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. The debt facilities impose operating and financial
restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries, including, among other things, limitations on the ability to:

•

pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity;

•

incur additional debt;

•

make investments;

•

create liens on assets to secure debt;

•

enter into transactions with affiliates;

•

issue stock of, or member’s interests in, subsidiaries;

•

enter into sale-leaseback transactions;

•

engage in other businesses;

•

merge or consolidate with another company;

•

transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets;

•

issue disqualified stock;

•

create dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; and

•

designate restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries.



If there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments, the holders of the defaulted debt
could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt (and, in the case of either Wynn Las Vegas or Wynn Macau debt, with respect to the Wynn Resorts term loan) to be due and payable immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash
flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities.

If Wynn Macau were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service its indebtedness or otherwise become unable to make certain payments or dividends
to us which we in turn could use to service the $1 billion Wynn Resorts term loan facility indebtedness (outstanding balance at December 31, 2008 of $375 million) or other indebtedness, our ability to service the indebtedness of Wynn Macau,
Wynn Resorts or Wynn Las Vegas, LLC could be negatively impacted.

Our subsidiaries’ indebtedness is secured by a substantial
portion of their assets.

Subject to applicable laws, including gaming laws, and certain agreed upon exceptions, our
subsidiaries’ debt is secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of our subsidiaries. In the event of a default by any of our subsidiaries under their financing documents, or if certain of our subsidiaries experience insolvency,
liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the holders of our subsidiaries’ secured debt instruments would first be entitled to payment from their collateral security, and only then would holders of our subsidiaries’ unsecured debt be
entitled to payment from their remaining assets.

Risks Related to our Business

Continued weakness and further weakening in global economic conditions may adversely affect consumer and corporate spending and tourism trends,
resulting in additional deterioration in our business.

Discretionary consumer spending has been adversely affected by the current
economic crisis. Worldwide, consumers are traveling less and spending less when they do travel. Likewise, corporate spending on conventions and business development is being significantly curtailed as businesses cut their budgets. Since our business
model relies on significant expenditure on luxury and discretionary items, continuation or deepening of the crisis will adversely affect our operations.

The current conditions in the world’s financial and credit markets adversely affects prospects of debt refinancing, availability of credit to us and to our customers and the profitability of our business.

There was unprecedented deterioration in financial and credit markets worldwide in 2008. There can be no assurance that the decline
is over and there can be no assurance that government response to these conditions will successfully address the fundamental weakness, restore consumer confidence or lead to improvement of or increase liquidity in the markets. Customer demand for
luxury amenities and leisure activities that we offer may be depressed or continue to decline.

There have been and will continue to
be large additions to the room supply in Las Vegas.

There have been and will continue to be large additions to the room supply in
Las Vegas. Even after the global economy begins to recover, there may be excess supply particularly in the luxury segment.

We are
entirely dependent on three properties for all of our cash flow, which subjects us to greater risks than a gaming company with more operating properties.

We are entirely dependent upon Wynn Las Vegas, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau for all of our cash flow. As a result, we are subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company with more operating
properties. The risks to which we have a greater degree of exposure include the following:

•

local economic and competitive conditions;



•

changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations;

•

natural and other disasters;

•

a decline in the number of visitors to Las Vegas or Macau;

•

a decrease in gaming and non-gaming activities at our properties ; and

•

the outbreak of an infectious disease such as the avian flu.

Any of the factors outlined above could negatively affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments or maintain our covenants with respect to our debt.

Our casino, hotel, convention and other facilities face intense competition.

Competition for Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.

The casino/hotel industry is highly competitive and additional developments are
currently underway. Resorts located on or near the Las Vegas Strip compete with other Las Vegas Strip hotels and with other hotel casinos in Las Vegas on the basis of overall atmosphere, range of amenities, level of service, price, location,
entertainment, theme and size, among other factors. Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas may also compete with one another.

Wynn
Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas also compete with other hotel/casino facilities in other cities, riverboat gaming facilities in other states, casino facilities on Native American lands and elsewhere in the world, state lotteries and other
forms of gaming. The proliferation of gaming activities in other areas could significantly harm our business as well. In particular, the legalization of casino gaming in or near metropolitan areas from which we attract customers could have a
negative effect on our business. In addition, new or renovated casinos in Macau, including Encore at Wynn Macau, or elsewhere in Asia could draw Asian gaming customers, including high-rollers, away from Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.

C

ompetition for Wynn Macau

. Currently there are approximately 31 operating casinos in Macau. We hold a
concession under one of only three gaming concessions and three sub-concessions authorized by the Macau government to operate casinos in Macau. The Macau government may grant additional gaming concessions beginning in 2009. If the Macau government
were to allow additional competitors to operate in Macau through the grant of additional concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

Wynn Macau also faces competition from casinos located in other areas of Asia, such as Genting Highlands Resort, a major
gaming and resort destination located outside of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and casinos in the Philippines. Two large-scale casinos that are being developed currently in Singapore will add further competition to the region. Wynn Macau also encounters
competition from other major gaming centers located around the world, including Australia and Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout Asia. Further, if current efforts to legalize gaming in Japan, or other
Asian countries are successful, Wynn Macau will face additional regional competition.

Our business relies on high-end, international
customers. We often extend credit, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit players or credit play may decrease.

General.

A significant portion of our table game revenue at our properties is attributable to the play of a limited number of international customers. The loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these
customers could have a substantial negative effect on our future operating results. A continued downturn in economic conditions in the countries in which these customers reside could cause a further reduction in the frequency of visits by and
revenue generated from these customers.

We conduct our gaming activities on a credit as well as a cash basis. This credit is unsecured.
Table games players typically are extended more credit than slot players, and high-stakes players typically are extended more



credit than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. The collectability of receivables from international customers could be negatively affected by future
business or economic trends or by significant events in the countries in which these customers reside. We will extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources, in the opinion of management, warrant such an extension.

In addition, high-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end
gaming may have a positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter.

Las Vegas.

While gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a “marker,” and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and judgments on gaming debts are
enforceable in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that direct or indirect enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign
nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the United States of foreign debtors may be used to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to collect the full amount of gaming debts owed to us, even in jurisdictions that enforce gaming debts. Recent dramatic changes in economic conditions may make it more difficult to assess creditworthiness and more difficult
to collect the full amounts of any gaming debt owed to us. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.

Wynn Macau.

Although the law in Macau was changed to permit casino operators to extend credit to gaming customers, Wynn Macau may not be able to collect all of its gaming receivables from its credit
players. We expect that Wynn Macau will be able to enforce these obligations only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To the extent that gaming customers of Wynn Macau are visitors from other jurisdictions, Wynn Macau may not have
access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and Wynn Macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts.
Wynn Macau’s inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on its operating results.

Currently, the
gaming tax in Macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue. However, unlike Nevada, the gross gaming revenue calculation in Macau does not include deductions for gaming bad debt. As a result, if we extend credit to our customers in
Macau and are unable to collect on the related receivables from them, we remain obligated to pay taxes on our winnings from these customers even though we were unable to collect on the related receivables from them.

Our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer and corporate spending as a result of downturns in the economy.

Consumer demand for hotel/casino resorts, trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities we offer is particularly
sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by the factors such as perceived or actual general
economic conditions, the current housing crisis, the current credit crisis, bank failures and the potential for additional bank failures, perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth, the current global economic recession and changes in
consumer confidence in the economy, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could reduce customer demand for the luxury amenities and leisure activities we offer, and may have a significant negative impact on our operating results.

The current recession and economic crisis have resulted in a significant decline in the amount of tourism and spending in Las Vegas. In the fourth
quarter, the occupancy rates across Las Vegas have declined by approximately 9.9%, room rates have declined by approximately 12.3% and Las Vegas Strip gaming revenue has



declined approximately 21.7%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. We have also recently experienced increased levels of attrition and cancellation in the
group business segment. If these trends continue, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected.

We are subject to extensive state and local regulation, and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations, which could have a negative effect on our business.

General.

The operations of Wynn Las Vegas, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau are contingent upon our obtaining and maintaining all
necessary regulatory licenses, permits, approvals, registrations, findings of suitability, orders and authorizations. The laws, regulations and ordinances requiring these licenses, permits and other approvals generally relate to the responsibility,
financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations, as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. The scope of the approvals required to open and operate a facility is extensive. We
received all approvals for the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005, and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas on December 22, 2008. We are subject to ongoing regulation to maintain their operations. We opened Wynn Macau on September 6,
2006, and are subject to ongoing regulation to maintain its operation.

The
Nevada Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require the holder of any debt or securities we issue to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own Wynn Resorts’ securities if it has reason to believe that the security
ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada.

Nevada regulatory authorities have broad powers to
request detailed financial and other information, to limit, condition, suspend or revoke a registration, gaming license or related approval and to approve changes in our operations. Substantial fines or forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming
laws or regulations may be levied. The suspension or revocation of any license which may be granted to us or the levy of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, compliance costs associated with gaming laws, regulations and licenses are significant. Any change in the laws, regulations or licenses applicable to our business or a violation of any current or future laws or regulations applicable to
our business or gaming licenses could require us to make substantial expenditures or could otherwise negatively affect our gaming operations.

Wynn Resorts’ articles of incorporation provide that, to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by the board of directors, Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of
its capital stock that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note, or both, as required, and pursuant to the terms established by, the applicable gaming authority
and, if not, as Wynn Resorts elects.

Wynn Macau.

Wynn Macau’s operations are subject to unique risks, including risks
related to Macau’s regulatory framework. Wynn Macau has developed certain operating procedures which are different from those used in United States casinos. Failure to adhere to the regulatory and gaming environment in Macau could result in the
revocation of Wynn Macau, S.A.’s concession or otherwise negatively affect its operations in Macau. Moreover, we would be subject to the risk that U.S. regulators could determine that Macau’s gaming regulatory framework has not developed
in a way that would permit us as a United States gaming operator, to conduct operations in Macau in a manner consistent with the way in which we intend, or the Nevada gaming authorities require us, to conduct our operations in the United States.

We are subject to taxation by various governments and agencies. The rate of taxation could change.

We are subject to taxation, both in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in Macau. Specific rates of taxation can be changed by
legislative actions. Increases in taxation could adversely affect our results.



Terrorism and the uncertainty of military conflicts, as well as other factors affecting
discretionary consumer spending, may harm our operating results.

The strength and profitability of our business depends on consumer
demand for hotel casino resorts in general and for the type of luxury amenities our properties offer. Changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could harm our business. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, other
terrorist activities in the United States and elsewhere, military conflicts in Iraq and in the Middle East, past outbreaks of infectious disease and tsunamis, among other things, have had negative impacts on travel and leisure expenditures,
including lodging, gaming and tourism. We cannot predict the extent to which similar events and conditions may continue to affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. An extended period of reduced discretionary spending and/or disruptions or
declines in airline travel and business conventions could significantly harm our operations. In particular, because our business will rely heavily upon high-end customers, particularly international customers, factors resulting in a decreased
propensity to travel internationally could have a negative impact on our operations.

In addition to terrorist activities, military
conflicts, the outbreak of infectious diseases such as the avian flu or the impact of a natural disaster such as a tsunami or typhoon, other factors affecting travel and discretionary consumer spending, including general economic conditions,
disposable consumer income, fears of recession and reduced consumer confidence in the economy, may negatively impact our business. Negative changes in any factors affecting discretionary spending could reduce customer demand for the products and
services we offer, thus imposing practical limits on pricing and harming our operations.

Our insurance coverage may not be adequate
to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase.

The terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001 have substantially affected the availability of insurance coverage for certain types of damages or occurrences. We currently have insurance coverage for terrorist acts with respect to Wynn Las Vegas, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas
and Wynn Macau for up to $800 million per occurrence for losses that could result from these acts. However, these types of acts could expose us to losses that exceed our coverage and could have a significant negative impact on our operations.

In addition, insurance premiums have increased and we may not have sufficient insurance coverage in the event of a catastrophic property
or casualty loss. We may also suffer disruption of our business in the event of a terrorist attack or other catastrophic property or casualty loss or be subject to claims by third parties injured or harmed. While we currently carry general liability
insurance and business interruption insurance, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in such event. In the event that insurance premiums continue to increase, we may not be able to maintain the insurance coverage we currently have
or otherwise be able to maintain adequate insurance protection.

If a third party successfully challenges our ownership of, or right
to use, the Wynn-related service marks, our business or results of operations could be harmed.

We have filed applications with the
PTO, to register a variety of WYNN-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. These marks include “WYNN RESORTS”, “WYNN DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT”, “WYNN LAS VEGAS”,
“ENCORE” and “WYNN MACAU”. Some of the applications are based upon ongoing use and others are based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks in the future.

A common element of most of these marks is the use of the surname, “WYNN.” As a general rule, a surname (or a mark primarily constituting a
surname) cannot be registered unless the surname has acquired “secondary meaning.” To date, we have been successful in demonstrating to the PTO such secondary meaning for the Wynn name, in certain of the applications, based upon
Mr. Wynn’s prominence as a resort developer, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful with the other pending applications.



Even if we are able to obtain registration of the WYNN-related marks, such federal registrations are not
completely dispositive of the right to such marks. Third parties who claim prior rights with respect to similar marks may nonetheless challenge our right to obtain registrations or our use of the marks and seek to overcome the presumptions afforded
by such registrations.

We have also filed applications with various foreign patent and trademark registries including registries in Macau,
China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, certain European countries and various other jurisdictions throughout the world to register a variety of WYNN-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. These
marks include many of the same marks filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and include “WYNN MACAU,” “ENCORE,” and “WYNN LAS VEGAS.” Some of the applications are based upon ongoing use and others are
based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks in the future.

We have recognized that our intellectual property assets, especially the
logo version of “Wynn”, are among our most valuable assets. As a result, and in connection with expansion of our resorts and gaming activities outside the United States, we have undertaken a program to register our trademarks and other
intellectual property rights in all relevant jurisdictions, some of which may pose a risk of unauthorized use or counterfeiting. We have retained counsel and will take all steps necessary to not only acquire but protect our intellectual property
rights against such unauthorized use throughout the world.

If a third party asserts other forms of intellectual property claims
against us, our business or results of operations could be adversely affected.

Historically, trademarks and service marks have been
the principal form of intellectual property right of relevance to the gaming industry. However, due to the increased use of technology in computerized gaming machines and in business operations generally, other forms of intellectual property rights
(such as patents and copyrights) are becoming of increased relevance. It is possible that, in the future, third parties might assert superior intellectual property rights or allege that their intellectual property rights cover some aspect of our
operations. The defense of such allegations may result in substantial expenses, and, if such claims are successfully prosecuted, may have a material impact on our business.

The loss of Stephen A. Wynn could significantly harm our business.

Our ability to maintain our competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts and skills of Stephen A. Wynn, the Chairman of the Board,
Chief Executive Officer and one of the principal stockholders of Wynn Resorts. In 2008, we extended the term of Mr. Wynn’s employment agreement until October 2020. However, we cannot assure you that Mr. Wynn will remain with us. If we
lose the services of Mr. Wynn, or if he is unable to devote sufficient attention to our operations for any other reason, our business may be significantly impaired. In addition, if Mr. Wynn is no longer either employed by us as Chief
Executive Officer or serving as Chairman of the Board, other than as a result of death or disability or other limited circumstances, it would constitute a change of control that would require Wynn Las Vegas to offer to repay the First Mortgage Notes
and would constitute an event of default under its credit facilities and Wynn Macau, S.A.’s credit facilities.

Our two largest
stockholders are able to exert significant control over our operations and future direction.

Mr. Wynn and Aruze USA, Inc. each
own approximately 21% of our currently outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. Wynn and Aruze USA, Inc., to the extent they vote their shares in a similar manner, may be able to control all matters requiring our stockholders’ approval,
including the approval of significant corporate transactions.

On November 13, 2006, the Board of Wynn Resorts approved an amendment
of its bylaws that exempts future acquisitions of shares of Wynn Resorts’ common stock by either Mr. Wynn or Aruze USA, Inc. (each owning approximately 21% of our common stock as of December 31, 2008) from Nevada’s acquisition of



controlling interest statutes. The Nevada acquisition of controlling interest statutes require stockholder approval in order to exercise voting rights in
connection with any acquisition of a controlling interest in certain Nevada corporations unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation in effect on the 10th day following the acquisition of a controlling interest by certain
acquiring persons provide that these statutes do not apply to the corporation or to the acquisition specifically by types of existing or future stockholders. These statutes define a “controlling interest” as (i) one-fifth or more but
less than one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more, of the voting power in the election of directors. As a result of the bylaw amendment, either Mr. Wynn or Aruze USA, Inc. or their
respective affiliates may acquire ownership of outstanding voting shares of Wynn Resorts permitting them to exercise more than one-third but less than a majority, or a majority or more, of all of the voting power of the corporation in the election
of directors, without requiring a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation granting voting rights in the control shares acquired.

In addition, Mr. Wynn and Aruze USA, Inc., together with Baron Asset Fund, have entered into a stockholders’ agreement. Under the stockholders’ agreement, Mr. Wynn and Aruze USA, Inc., have agreed to vote their shares of
our common stock for a slate of directors, a majority of which will be designated by Mr. Wynn, of which at least two will be independent directors, and the remaining members of which will be designated by Aruze USA, Inc. As a result of this
voting arrangement, Mr. Wynn, as a practical matter, controls the slate of directors to be elected to our board of directors. In addition, in November 2006, this agreement was amended to require the written consent of both Mr. Wynn and
Aruze USA, Inc. prior to either party selling any shares of Wynn Resorts that it owns.

Because we own real property, we are subject
to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.

We
have incurred costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to discharges into the air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances.
Under these and other environmental requirements we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at our property. As an owner or operator, we could also be held responsible to a governmental entity
or third parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination.

These laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. The liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several
unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to
remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use our property.

Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or
applicable Anti-Money Laundering Regulation could have a negative impact on us.

We are subject to regulations imposed by the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Any determination that we
have violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of
anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a negative effect on our results of operations.



Risks Associated with Wynn Macau

Visitation to Macau may decline due to continued economic disruptions in mainland China as well as increased restrictions on visitations to Macau
from citizens of mainland China.

A significant number of our gaming customers at Wynn Macau come from mainland China. A continued
slow down in the economic growth of China could disrupt the number of patrons visiting our property or the amount they may be willing to spend. In addition, any travel restrictions imposed by China could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland
China to our property. During 2008 China implemented certain policies limiting visitation to Macau and Hong Kong by mainland Chinese residents. It is not known when, or if, these policies will be relaxed. The visa policy may be adjusted further in
the future.

We compete for limited labor resources in Macau and Macau government policies may also affect our ability to employ
imported labor.

We recruited a substantial number of new employees for the opening of Wynn Macau and the success of our operations
will be affected by our success in retaining them. Wynn Macau competes with the large number of new casino resort developments currently underway in Macau for the limited qualified employees. We will have to seek employees from other countries to
adequately staff Wynn Macau. Further, recent policies announced by the Macau government have affected our ability to import labor in certain job classifications. We are coordinating with the Macau labor and immigration authorities to ensure our
labor demand is satisfied, but cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees for our Wynn Macau operations or that we will be able to obtain required work permits for those employees.

We depend upon games promoters for a significant portion of our gaming revenue. If we are unable to maintain, or develop additional,
successful relationships with reputable games promoters, our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues could be adversely affected. Increased competition may result in increased pressure on commission rates.

A significant portion of our gaming revenue is generated by clientele of our games promoters. With the rise in gaming in Macau, the competition for
services provided by games promoters has increased. We anticipate that this competition will further intensify as additional casinos are expected to open in Macau in the near future. While we believe that we currently maintain good relations with
our existing games promoters, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to maintain these relationships. If we are unable to maintain, or develop additional, successful relationships with reputable games promoters, or lose a
significant number of our games promoters to our competitors, our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues will be adversely affected and we will have to seek alternative ways of developing relationships with VIP customers. In addition, if
our games promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our VIP customers, our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues will be hampered.

Macau recently experienced a consolidation of games promoters. As a consequence, certain game promoters have significant leverage and bargaining strength in negotiating operational agreements with casino operators.
Although there is some uncertainty as to whether such consolidation will become a trend in Macau, any consolidation could result in negative changes in our operational agreements, including higher commissions, the loss of business to a competitor or
the loss of our exclusive relationships with games promoters. While we have not had to adjust our compensation arrangements with games promoters thus far, we are aware of increased commission rates paid by other casino operators to games promoters
in the Macau market. If we need to increase our commission rates, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

If our
games promoters are unable to maintain required standards of probity and integrity, we may face consequences from gaming regulators with authority over our operations.

The reputations of the games promoters we deal with are important to our own reputation and to our ability to operate in compliance with our concession
and Macau gaming laws. While we both endeavor, through contractual protections and otherwise, to ensure that our games promoters comply with the high standards of



probity and integrity under Macau gaming laws, we cannot assure you that our games promoters will always comply with these high standards. In addition, if we
enter into a business relationship with a games promoter whose probity is in doubt, this may be considered by regulators or investors to reflect negatively on our own probity. If any of our games promoters violate the Macau gaming laws while on our
premises, the Macau government may, in its discretion, take enforcement action against us, the games promoter, or each concurrently, and we may be sanctioned and our reputation could be harmed.

The financial resources of our games promoters may be insufficient to allow them to continue doing business at Wynn Macau.

The global financial crisis may cause our games promoters to encounter decreased liquidity limiting their ability to grant credit to their patrons and
thereby decreasing gaming volume at Wynn Macau. Further, credit already extended by our games promoters to their patrons may become increasingly difficult for them to collect. This inability to grant credit and collect amounts due can negatively
affect our games promoters’ operations at Wynn Macau, and as a result, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.

The development costs of Encore at Wynn Macau are estimates only, and actual development costs may be higher than expected. Not all of the construction costs of Encore at Wynn Macau are covered by a guaranteed maximum price
construction contract, and we will be responsible for any cost overruns of these excluded items.

We expect the total development
costs of Encore at Wynn Macau to be approximately $700 million. While we believe that the overall budget for the development costs of Encore at Wynn Macau is reasonable, these development costs are estimates and actual development costs may be
higher than expected. Although we have certain contingencies set aside to cover cost overruns, these contingencies may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of such overruns and we may not have the funds required to pay the excess costs.

We have entered into a guaranteed maximum price construction contract for the design and construction of Encore at Wynn Macau with
Leighton Contractors (Asia) Limited, China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited and China Construction Engineering (Macau) Company Limited, acting together as general contractor (“Leighton/China State”). The contract covers
approximately $347.8 million of the budgeted $700 million design and construction costs. We are responsible for cost overruns with respect to any budgeted components that are not part of the amended guaranteed maximum price contract.

The financial resources of our contractor may be insufficient to fund cost overruns or liquidated damages for which it is responsible under the
amended guaranteed maximum price contract.

Under the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations of the guaranteed maximum
price construction contract, Leighton/China State is responsible for all construction costs covered by the construction contract that exceed the approximately $347.8 million guaranteed maximum price contained in the contract. The parent companies of
the contractor have provided a continuing guaranty by which they guarantee the contractor’s full performance under the construction contract until final payment under that contract. We cannot assure you that the contractor or its parent
companies will have sufficient financial resources to fund any cost overruns or liquidated damages for which they are responsible under the guaranteed maximum price contract. Furthermore, neither is contractually obligated to maintain the financial
resources to cover cost overruns. If they do not have the resources to meet their obligations and we are unable to obtain funds from them in a timely manner, we may need to pay these excess costs in order to complete construction of Wynn Diamond
Suites.

Wynn Macau may be affected by adverse political and economic conditions.

The success of Wynn Macau will depend on political and economic conditions in Macau. In December 1999, after approximately 450 years of
Portuguese control, Portugal returned Macau to Chinese administration. The People’s Republic of China established Macau as a special administrative region. As a result



of this change in control, Macau’s legislative, regulatory, legal, economic and cultural institutions are in a period of transition. We cannot predict
how these systems and cultural institutions will develop, or how developments would affect the business of Wynn Macau.

Wynn Macau’s
operations are subject to significant political, economic and social risks inherent in doing business in an emerging market. For example, fiscal decline and civil, domestic or international unrest in Macau, China or the surrounding region could
significantly harm Wynn Macau’s business, not only by reducing customer demand for casino resorts, but also by increasing the risk of imposition of taxes and exchange controls or other governmental restrictions that might impede its ability to
repatriate funds.

Macau may not have an adequate transportation infrastructure to accommodate the demand from future development.

Because of additional casino projects which are under construction and to be developed in the future, the ferry and helicopter
services which provide transportation between Macau and Hong Kong may need to be expanded to accommodate the increased visitation of Macau. If transportation facilities to and from Macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of
gaming customers visiting Macau, the desirability of Macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results of operations of Wynn Macau, could be negatively impacted.

Extreme weather conditions may have an adverse impact on Wynn Macau.

Macau’s subtropical
climate and location on the South China Sea are subject to extreme weather conditions including typhoons and heavy rainstorms. Unfavorable weather conditions could negatively affect the profitability of Wynn Macau by disrupting our ability to timely
construct the project and by preventing or discouraging guests from traveling to Macau.

An outbreak of the avian influenza
(“avian flu” or “bird flu”), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (“SARS”) or other contagious disease may have an adverse effect on the economies of certain Asian countries and may adversely affect our results of
operations.

During 2004, large parts of Asia experienced unprecedented outbreaks of avian flu. In particular, Guangdong Province,
PRC, which is located across the Zhuhai Bridge from Macau, has confirmed several cases of avian flu. Currently, no fully effective avian flu vaccines have been developed and there can be no assurance that an effective vaccine can be discovered in
time to protect against a potential avian flu pandemic. In the first half of 2003, certain countries in Asia experienced an outbreak of SARS, a highly contagious form of atypical pneumonia, which seriously interrupted economic activities and caused
the demand for goods to plummet in the affected regions. There can be no assurance that an outbreak of avian flu, SARS or other contagious disease or the measures taken by the governments of affected countries against such potential outbreaks, will
not seriously interrupt our gaming operations or visitation to Macau, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The perception that an outbreak of avian flu, SARS or other contagious disease may occur again may also have
an adverse effect on the economic conditions of countries in Asia.

Our investment in Macau may be subject to potential
taxation

.

Our investment in Macau is owned through a number of wholly-owned and partially-owned domestic and
foreign entities. Although we believe that transfers to these entities of the assets and stock of the Wynn Macau companies were accomplished on a tax-free basis, there is a risk that the Internal Revenue Service may assert in the future that any
appreciation in the transferred assets or stock was taxable at the time of such transfers.

The Macau government can terminate our
concession under certain circumstances without compensation to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.

The Macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate our concession in the event of our material non-compliance with the basic obligations under the concession and applicable Macau laws. The concession



agreement expressly provides that the government of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession agreement if Wynn Macau, S.A.:

•

conducts unauthorized games or activities that are excluded from its corporate purpose;

•

suspends gaming operations in Macau for more than seven consecutive days (or more than 14 days in a civil year) without justification;

•

defaults in payment of taxes, premiums, contributions or other required amounts;

•

does not comply with government inspections or supervision;

•

systematically fails to observe its obligations under the concession system;

•

fails to maintain bank guarantees or bonds satisfactory to the government;

•

is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or becomes insolvent;

•

engages in serious fraudulent activity, damaging to the public interest; or,

•

repeatedly violates applicable gaming laws.

If the government of Macau unilaterally rescinds the concession agreement, Wynn Macau, S.A. will be required to compensate the government in accordance with applicable law, and the areas defined as casino space under Macau law and all of
the gaming equipment pertaining to the gaming operations of Wynn Macau will be transferred to the government without compensation. The loss of our concession would prohibit us from conducting gaming operations in Macau, which would have a material
adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.

Revenues from our Macau gaming operations will end if we cannot secure an
extension of our concession in 2022 or if the Macau government exercises its redemption right in 2017.

Our concession agreement
expires in June 2022. Unless our concession is extended, in June 2022, all of our casino operations and related equipment in Macau will be automatically transferred to the Macau government without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any
revenues from these operations. Beginning in June 2017, the Macau government may redeem the concession agreement by providing us at least one year’s prior notice. In the event the Macau government exercises this redemption right, we are
entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew or
extend our concession agreement on terms favorable to us or at all. We also cannot assure you that if our concession is redeemed, the compensation paid will be adequate to compensate us for the loss of future revenues.

Certain Nevada gaming laws apply to Wynn Macau’s gaming activities and associations.

Certain Nevada gaming laws also apply to gaming activities and associations in jurisdictions outside the State of Nevada. As we develop Wynn Macau, we and
our subsidiaries that must be licensed to conduct gaming operations in Nevada are required to comply with certain reporting requirements concerning gaming activities and associations in Macau conducted by our Macau-related subsidiaries. We and our
licensed Nevada subsidiaries also will be subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Gaming Commission if our Macau-related subsidiaries:

•

knowingly violate any Macau laws relating to their Macau gaming operations;

•

fail to conduct Wynn Macau’s operations in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;

•

engage in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable for us because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects
or tends to reflect discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to Nevada gaming policies;



•

engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the State of Nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees; or,

•

employ, contract with or associate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground
of unsuitability, or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling.

Such disciplinary action could include
suspension, conditioning, limitation or revocation of the registration, licenses or approvals held by us and our licensed Nevada subsidiaries, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, and the imposition of substantial fines.

In addition, if the Nevada State Gaming Control Board determines that any actual or intended activities or associations of our Macau-related subsidiaries
may be prohibited pursuant to one or more of the standards described above, the Nevada State Gaming Control Board can require us and our licensed Nevada subsidiaries to file an application with the Nevada Gaming Commission for a finding of
suitability of the activity or association. If the Nevada Gaming Commission finds that the activity or association in Macau is unsuitable or prohibited, our Macau-related subsidiaries will either be required to terminate the activity or association,
or will be prohibited from undertaking the activity or association. Consequently, should the Nevada Gaming Commission find that our Macau-related subsidiary’s gaming activities or associations in Macau are unsuitable, those subsidiaries may be
prohibited from undertaking their planned gaming activities or associations in Macau, or be required to divest their investment in Macau, possibly on unfavorable terms.

Unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates may increase Wynn Macau’s obligations under the concession agreement and cause fluctuations in the value of our investment in Macau.

The currency delineated in Wynn Macau’s concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a
freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively
stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese
governmental policies and international economic and political developments.

We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau
pataca will continue to be linked to the U.S. dollar, which may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies. We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for
these currencies will remain at the same level.

Because many of Wynn Macau’s payment and expenditure obligations are in Macau
patacas, in the event of unfavorable Macau pataca or Hong Kong dollar rate changes, Wynn Macau’s obligations, as denominated in U.S. dollars, would increase. In addition, because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that Wynn
Macau operates in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars, we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. Also, if any of our Macau-related entities incur U.S.
dollar-denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on Wynn Macau’s results of operations, financial condition and ability to
service its debt.

Currency exchange controls and currency export restrictions could negatively impact Wynn Macau.

Currency exchange controls and restrictions on the export of currency by certain countries may negatively impact the success of
Wynn Macau. For example, there are currently existing currency exchange controls and restrictions on the export of the renminbi, the currency of China. Restrictions on the export of the renminbi may impede the flow of gaming customers from China to
Macau, inhibit the growth of gaming in Macau and negatively impact Wynn Macau’s gaming operations.

PROPERTIES

Las Vegas Land

We currently own approximately 240 acres of land on or near the Las Vegas Strip consisting of approximately 75 acres at the northeast corner of the
intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Sands Avenue on which Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas are located, the approximately 142-acre golf course behind Wynn Las Vegas, approximately 5 acres adjacent to the golf course on which an office
building is located, and approximately 18 acres located across from the Wynn Las Vegas site at Koval Lane and Sands Avenue, a portion of which is improved with an employee parking garage. Our Las Vegas property, with limited exceptions, is
encumbered by a first priority security interest in favor of our lenders under our first mortgage notes and our Wynn Las Vegas bank credit facilities.

Las Vegas Water Rights

We own approximately 934 acre-feet of permitted domestic and recreation water rights, which we
currently use to irrigate the golf course. We also own approximately 52 acre-feet of permitted (and some certificated) quasi-municipal water rights, which are used to supply the water for the Wynn Las Vegas lake/mountain feature. There are
significant cost savings and conservation benefits associated with using water supplied pursuant to our water rights. We anticipate using our water rights to support future development of the golf course land.

Macau Land Concession

The government of Macau owns
most of the land in Macau. In most cases, private interests in real property located in Macau are obtained through long-term leases and other grants of rights to use land from the government. In July 2004, our subsidiary, Wynn Macau, S.A., entered
into a land concession contract under which Wynn Macau, S.A. leases from the Macau government an approximately 16-acre parcel of land in downtown Macau’s inner harbor area where Wynn Macau is located. The term of the land concession contract is
25 years, and it may be renewed with government approval for successive periods. Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated to pay, in 10 semi-annual installments, a total land concession premium of approximately 319.4 million patacas (approximately US
$40 million) plus interest at 5%. Annual rents of approximately 2.2 million patacas (approximately US $275,000) for the first two years and 3.2 million patacas (approximately US $398,000) thereafter will also be paid in accordance
with the land concession contract

In addition, we have applied to the government of Macau for a land concession for approximately 52 acres
on Cotai for future development and are awaiting final approval. Due to the current economic environment, no construction timeline or budget has been prepared.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are occasionally party to
lawsuits. As with all litigation, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of such matters and we note that litigation inherently involves significant costs. We are not currently party to any material legal proceedings.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Market Information

Our common stock trades on the
NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “WYNN.” The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices for the indicated periods, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

Holders

There were approximately 208 record holders of our common stock as of February 17, 2009.

Dividends

Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries’
ability to provide funds to us. Restrictions imposed by our and our subsidiaries’ debt instruments significantly restrict certain key subsidiaries holding a majority of our assets, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A., from making
dividends or distributions to Wynn Resorts. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture governing the first mortgage notes from making certain “restricted payments,” as defined in
the indenture. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. Restricted payments cannot be made unless certain financial and non-financial
criteria have been satisfied. In addition, the terms of the other loan agreements of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. contain similar restrictions. Further, proceeds received by Wynn Resorts as the result of certain dispositions and funds
drawn from the $1 billion Wynn Resorts term loan are not permitted to be paid as a dividend by us.

In each of November 2006 and 2007, our
Board of Directors declared a cash distribution of $6.00 per common share which was paid in the following month. We have not adopted a policy regarding the payment of dividends, however we plan to evaluate the payment of dividends from time to time.



Stock Performance Graph

The graph below compares the five year cumulative total return on our common stock to the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index (“S&P 500”) and the Dow Jones US
Casino Index. The performance graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2003 in each of the Company’s common stock, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones US Casino Index, and that all dividends were reinvested. The stock price
performance shown in this graph is neither necessarily indicative of, nor intended to suggest, future stock price performance.

The performance graph should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other of
our filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act of 1934, unless we specifically incorporate the performance graph by reference therein.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes
thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. We currently own and operate Wynn Las Vegas, a destination casino resort in Las
Vegas, Nevada, which opened on April 28, 2005, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, a destination casino resort located adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas, which opened on December 22, 2008, and Wynn Macau, a destination casino resort in the Macau Special
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (“Macau”), which opened on September 6, 2006. We have also commenced construction of Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau. We believe Wynn Las Vegas and
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas are the preeminent destination casino resorts on the Strip in Las Vegas. Until the opening of Wynn Las Vegas in 2005, we were solely a development stage company.

In response to our evaluation of the completed Wynn Las Vegas project and the reactions of our guests, we began to make enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas in the third quarter of 2005 which continued throughout 2008.



Encore at Wynn Las Vegas

We opened Encore at Wynn Las Vegas on December 22, 2008. This resort is located on the Las Vegas Strip, immediately adjacent to and connected with
Wynn Las Vegas. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas currently features:

•

An approximately 72,000 square foot casino offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons and a sports book;

•

Luxury hotel accommodation in 2,034 all-suite rooms;

•

Twelve food and beverage outlets;

A showroom, nightclub and lounges.

Wynn Macau

We opened Wynn Macau on September 6, 2006 and we completed an expansion of this resort in December 2007.
Wynn Macau currently features:

•

An approximately 205,000 square foot casino offering 24-hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons and a poker room;

•

Luxury hotel accommodations in 600 rooms and suites;

•

Recreation and leisure facilities, including a health club, pool and spa; and

•

We
have commenced construction on a further expansion of Wynn Macau that will add a fully-integrated resort hotel named Encore at Wynn Macau, with approximately 400 luxury suites and four villas, as well as additional VIP gaming areas, food and
beverage and retail amenities. We expect Encore at Wynn Macau to open in 2010.

In response to our evaluation of Wynn Macau and the
reactions of our guests, we have and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to the property.

We operate Wynn Macau under
a 20-year casino concession agreement granted by the Macau government in June 2002.

Future Development

Approximately 142 acres of land comprising Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas is currently improved with a golf course. While we may develop this
property in the future; due to the current economic environment and certain restrictions in our credit facilities, we have no immediate plans to develop this property.



We have applied to the government of Macau for a land concession for approximately 52 acres on Cotai and
are awaiting final governmental approval of this concession. No construction timeline or budget have been prepared.

Current Economic
and Operating Environment

Due to a number of factors affecting consumers, including a slowdown in global economies, contracting credit
markets, and reduced consumer spending, and new U.S. political leadership, the outlook for the gaming, travel, and entertainment industries both domestically and abroad remains highly uncertain. Auto traffic into Las Vegas, airline capacity and air
travel to McCarran International airport have declined, resulting in lower casino volumes and a reduced demand for hotel rooms. This slow down was particularly significant in the fourth quarter of 2008 and has continued into the first quarter of
2009. Based on our experience in 2008 and current market conditions, we believe that Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas will continue to experience lower than historical hotel occupancy rates, room rates, casino volumes and accordingly
lower departmental profitability. As a result of the current economic conditions, we have increasingly focused on efficiency initiatives that we began implementing at our Las Vegas properties and corporate in early 2009. These initiatives include
reductions in pay for salaried employees in Las Vegas, reduced work weeks for full-time hourly employees, a substantial reduction of 2009 bonus accruals and a suspension of the employer match to the 401(k) contributions. We expect that these
initiatives, along with other operational efficiencies, will save approximately $75-$100 million annually. We are continually reviewing the cost and efficiencies at our operating properties and corporate to identify further opportunities to reduce
costs during these uncertain economic times. Wynn Macau has also been impacted by the slowing global economy and visa restrictions implemented in September 2008.

The factors described above accelerated through 2008 with fourth quarter results in Las Vegas significantly weaker than 2007. Additionally, in early 2009, we have experienced cancellation and attrition of group
business at greater than historical levels.

Results of Operations

Our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable for the following reasons:

•

On September 6, 2006, we opened Wynn Macau;

•

On September 11, 2006, Wynn Macau completed the sale of a Macau subconcession right and recognized a pre-tax gain of $899.4 million;

•

On December 24, 2007, we opened an expansion at Wynn Macau; and

•

On December 22, 2008, we opened Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.

Accordingly, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 include a full year of operations for the expansion at Wynn Macau and 10 days of operations for Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. The year ended
December 31, 2006 includes a full year of operations for Wynn Las Vegas and 117 days of operations for Wynn Macau. In addition, we believe that our operating results at Wynn Las Vegas, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau for the year ended
December 31, 2008 have been adversely impacted by the weakened global economy. Disruptions in the global financial and stock markets and reduced levels of consumer spending have and may continue to adversely impact our financial results. In
addition, as noted above, visa restrictions have placed certain limitations on visitation to Macau. These restrictions have and will continue to adversely impact visitation to Macau by residents of mainland China.



The table below displays our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
(amounts in thousands):

Reliance on only three properties (in two geographic regions) for our operating cash flow exposes
us to certain risks that competitors, whose operations are more diversified, may be better able to control. In addition to the concentration of operations in three properties, many of our customers are high-end gaming customers who wager on credit,
thus exposing us to increased credit risk. High-end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results.

Operating
Measures

Certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance
for the periods for which a Consolidated Statement of Income is presented. Casinos generally record table games win as a percentage of either drop or turnover and slot win as a percentage of handle. In our casino operations at Wynn Las Vegas and
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, table games win is recorded as a percentage of drop. However, in our casino operations at Wynn Macau, we separate table play into two distinct classifications. Our Macau VIP casino segment records table games win as a
percentage of turnover, whereas our general casino records win as a percentage of drop.

Below are definitions of the statistics discussed:

•

Table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue.

•

Drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table’s drop box.

•

Turnover is the sum of all losing Rolling Chip wagers within our Wynn Macau VIP program.

•

Rolling Chips are identifiable chips that are used to track VIP wagering volume (turnover) for purposes of calculating incentives.

•

Slot win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenue.

•

Average Daily Rate (“ADR”) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied.

•

Revenue per Available Room (“REVPAR”) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms available.

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007

Revenues

Net
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 are comprised of $2,261.9 million in casino revenues (75.7% of total net revenues) and $725.4 million of net non-casino revenues (24.3% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2007 were comprised of $1,949.9 million in casino revenues (72.6% of total net revenues) and $737.6 million of net non-casino revenues (27.4% of total net revenues). Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which opened on December 22, 2008,
did not significantly impact our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.



Casino revenues are comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 of approximately $2,261.9 million represents a $312 million (or 16%) increase from casino revenues of $1,949.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. At Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore
at Wynn Las Vegas, we experienced a $162.6 million decrease in casino revenues compared to the prior year due to a 7.1% decrease in drop and a decrease in our table games win percentage. Our table games win percentage (before discounts) for the year
ended December 31, 2008 was 20.0%, which was below the expected range of 21% to 24% and compares to 25.3% for the prior year. Slot handle at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, decreased 12.9% during the year ended
December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%. As noted earlier, we believe the decrease in casino volumes reflect the overall slowdown in the global economy partially offset by
the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. In the fourth quarter of 2008, casino revenue at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, declined 43.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of a decrease in table games drop of
20.2% and a decline in our table games win percentage to 15.3% compared to 23.5% in the prior year fourth quarter. Slot handle at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, decreased 22.7% during the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the
fourth quarter of 2007.

Casino revenues at Wynn Macau increased $474.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to
the prior year. At Wynn Macau, we experienced a 47.4% increase in turnover in the VIP casino segment and our win as a percent of turnover was 3%, which is at the high end of our expected range of 2.7% to 3% compared to 3.1% in the prior year. Our
VIP casino segment win as a percent of turnover includes a nominal beneficial effect attributable to non-rolling chip play. In our general casino at Wynn Macau, drop increased 14.2% when compared to the prior year and the table games win percentage
was 19.6%, which is within the expected range of 18% to 20%. The table game win percentage at Wynn Macau for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 19%. Slot handle at Wynn Macau increased 79.5% compared to the prior year and the slot win
percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%. The increase in casino revenue at Wynn Macau is a result of growth during the first nine months of the year in the Macau market as well as our casino expansion which opened in December 2007.
We expect that this rapid growth in the Macau market will slow due to the overall slowdown in the global economy and visa restrictions that went into effect in September 2008 which limit visitation to Macau by certain residents of mainland China.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, total room revenues were approximately $326.7 million, a $12.7 million decrease compared to the
year ended December 31, 2007. Room revenue at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, decreased approximately $17.2 million compared to the prior year due to lower occupancy and lower rates, while room revenue at Wynn Macau
increased approximately $4.5 million due to increased rates. In the fourth quarter of 2008, room revenue at Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, declined by 14% as our occupancy percentage declined 14.6% and the average daily rate
declined 6%, all compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Room rates have continued to decline as the economic slowdown reduces demand for our product.

The table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue for Wynn Macau and Wynn Las Vegas, including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.



Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 included food and beverage revenues
of approximately $358.7 million, retail revenues of approximately $147.9 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $66.2 million, and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon, of approximately $56 million. Other non-gaming
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $354 million, retail revenues of approximately $123.4 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $64.5 million, and other revenues from
outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $57.3 million. The increase in food and beverage revenues and retail revenues were primarily driven by our Macau operations and to a lesser extent 10 days of operations of Encore at Wynn Las
Vegas, offset by decreases at Wynn Las Vegas due to the economic factors noted earlier. General growth in the Macau market and our expansion, which opened in December 2007 (including additional retail outlets), were primarily responsible for the
increases. As noted earlier, we do not expect this growth to continue in the general Macau market due to the slowdown in the global economy, visa restrictions and increased casino and hotel capacity recently introduced or expected to be introduced
in the near future to the market. Entertainment revenues increased approximately $10.9 million from Le Rêve at Wynn Las Vegas, offset by a decrease of $9.2 million due to the closure of Spamalot in mid-July 2008. Together with the producers,
we elected to end Spamalot’s run at Wynn Las Vegas in July 2008 pursuant to the terms of our contract. We have renovated the theater and on February 10, 2009, it reopened as the Encore Theater featuring Danny Gans.

Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses

During the year ended December 31, 2008, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $1,491 million, rooms expenses of $78.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $207.3 million, and entertainment, retail
and other expenses of $161.9 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $319.3 million and approximately $49.4 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended
December 31, 2007, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $1,168.1 million, room expenses of $83.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $212.6 million, entertainment, retail and other expenses of $161.1 million, general and
administrative expenses of approximately $310.8 million and approximately $36.1 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. Casino expenses have increased over the prior year primarily related to the increased revenue at Wynn
Macau as noted above, including the 39 percent gross win tax on casino revenues. General and administrative expenses have increased primarily related to the opening of our expansion of Wynn Macau in December 2007, offset by a decrease in employee
bonuses in Las Vegas. The provision for doubtful accounts increased during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to an increase in reserves established in light of the current global economic uncertainty.

Pre-opening costs

Pre-opening
costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $72.4 million compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2007. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008 related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.
Pre-opening costs related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas ceased once it opened on December 22, 2008.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $262.8 million, an increase of $42.9 million when compared
to the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to (i) depreciation expense associated with the opening of the expansion of Wynn Macau, a portion of which opened in September 2007, and the remainder which opened in December 2007; (ii)
shortened estimated lives, beginning in March 2008, of certain hotel room furniture, fixtures and equipment at Wynn Las Vegas based on a planned room renovation; and (iii) the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. In light of current economic
conditions, the room renovation at Wynn Las Vegas has been postponed.



During the construction of our properties, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings,
improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these properties opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. Depreciation expenses will
continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful lives of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted.

The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022
and 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.

Property charges and other

Based upon our evaluation of our completed properties and the reactions
of our guests, we have made and continue to make enhancements and refinements to our properties. Costs relating to assets retired or abandoned as a result of these enhancements and remodel efforts are expensed as property charges. Property charges
and other for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $32.6 million compared to approximately $70.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $17.8 million of
costs associated with Spamalot at Wynn Las Vegas which closed in mid-July 2008. Together with the producers, we elected to end the show’s run at Wynn Las Vegas pursuant to the contract. The charge includes production rights that were included
in intangible assets, show production costs that were included in other assets and certain other property and equipment. We also incurred a charge of $3.6 million related to the abandonment of certain existing floor space at Wynn Macau to begin
construction on a new restaurant. The remaining property charges were related to miscellaneous renovations and abandonments at both Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau.

Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the following charges at Wynn Macau: (a) a $10 million charge for the abandonment of our parking garage to make way for Encore at Wynn
Macau, (b) a $10.2 million charge related to abandonment costs for portions of the main kitchen, warehouse and restaurants to enable the main casino to be connected with the expansion that opened in December 2007, (c) a $22.1 million
charge related to significant casino and retail reconfigurations in the expansion that opened in December 2007, and (d) a $15.5 million charge related to the abandonment of a theater. The remaining property charges were related to renovations
to portions of the Le Rêve Theater, the abandonment of a marquee sign and the conversion of two retail outlets and a nightclub at Wynn Las Vegas, as well as the remodeling of certain areas at Wynn Macau. Offsetting these charges for the year
ended December 31, 2007 was a gain of $9.4 million on the sale of a company aircraft.

We expect to continue to remodel and make
enhancements at our properties.

Other non-operating costs and expenses

Interest income decreased by $25.8 million to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $47.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates as compared to the prior year. During 2008, the Company’s short-term investment strategy was primarily to preserve capital while retaining sufficient
liquidity. Accordingly, our short-term investments were primarily in investments in U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of three months or less.

Interest expense was $172.7 million, net of capitalized interest of $87.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $143.8 million, net of capitalized interest of $44.6 million, for the year ended December 31,
2007. Interest expense increased approximately $43.4 million due to borrowings under the $1 billion Wynn Resorts term loan facility drawn in late 2007, approximately $24.1 million related to the additional $400 million Wynn Las Vegas first mortgage
notes issued in November 2007 and approximately $12 million net on borrowings from our Wynn Las Vegas, Wynn Macau and other credit facilities. These increases were offset



by approximately $7.8 million less interest expense due to the conversion of the Debentures in July 2007 and an increase of $42.8 million in capitalized
interest related to our construction activities. In future periods, interest expense will increase significantly as we no longer capitalize such costs related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.

Our interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended. The fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value
of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase (or decrease) in swap fair value in each period. We recorded a net expense of approximately $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 due to the net decrease in the fair value of
our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a net expense of $6 million due to the net decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps between
December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Item 7A – “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”

In November 2008, the Company purchased $625 million principal amount of its outstanding loans under the $1 billion Wynn Resorts term loan facility at a
discounted price of 95.375%. This resulted in the retirement of $625 million of principal for a payment of $596.1 million. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a gain of $22.3 million on early retirement of debt, net of the write-off of
unamortized debt issue costs and fees.

Other represents the loss recognized in connection with foreign currency remeasurements of assets
and liabilities in Macau that are not denominated in the local currency.

Income Taxes

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a current tax provision of $1.9 million and a deferred tax benefit of $62.8 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company completed a study of the taxes, levies and obligations assessed on operations of Wynn Macau
under Macau law and its Macau Gaming Concession. As a result, the Company recognized tax benefits of $721.6 million (net of valuation allowance increases) for foreign tax credits applicable to the earnings of Wynn Macau. Of the $721.6 million,
$650.6 was used to offset 2008 U.S. income tax expense incurred as a result of the repatriation of Wynn Macau earnings and $71.0 million (net of valuation allowance) is recorded as deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has no
earnings in foreign subsidiaries that are considered permanently invested.

Our effective tax rate/(benefit) for the year ended
December 31, 2008, was (40.8%). This rate was 75.8 percentage points lower than the U.S. Federal rate of 35%, primarily due to the repatriation of foreign earnings and related foreign tax credits, a domestic operating loss, and the tax holiday
applicable to the earnings of Wynn Macau, S.A..

Effective September 6, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received a 5-year exemption from
Macau’s 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $27.7 million in such taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau
Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies (at a rate equal to 39%) in accordance with its concession agreement.

Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Revenues

Net
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 were comprised of $1,949.9 million in casino revenues (72.6% of total net revenues) and $737.6 million of net non-casino revenues (27.4% of total net revenues). Net



revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were comprised of $800.6 million in casino revenues (55.9% of total net revenues) and $631.7 million of
net non-casino revenues (44.1% of total net revenues). The quality of our resorts’ non-casino amenities, combined with providing guests an unparalleled total resort experience, has driven a premium in our properties’ ADR as well as
increased the length of casino play, but the majority of revenue from Wynn Macau continues to be generated in the casino segment.

Casino
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 of approximately $1,949.9 million represents approximately a $1,149.3 million (or 143.6%) increase from casino revenues of $800.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The year ended
December 31, 2007 includes a full year of Wynn Macau’s operations, compared to only 117 days in 2006. At Wynn Las Vegas, we experienced a 14.6% increase in drop for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the average table games win
percentage (before discounts) of 25.3% was above the expected range of 21% to 24%. Table games win percentage was 22.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Slot handle at Wynn Las Vegas increased less than 1% during the year ended
December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%. Wynn Macau’s win percentage for the VIP casino segment of 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007, was just above the
expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%. The average table games win percentage at the general casino at Wynn Macau of 19% was at the top of the expected range of 17% to 19%. Wynn Macau’s slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to
5.5%.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, room revenues were approximately $339.4 million, which represents a $56.3 million (or
19.9%) increase over the $283.1 million generated in the year ended December 31, 2006. Wynn Macau generated $38.8 million of this increase in room revenue during the year ended December 31, 2007, its first full year of operations. The
table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue.

Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 included food and beverage
revenues of approximately $354 million, retail revenues of approximately $123.4 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $64.5 million, and other revenues from outlets such as the spa and salon, of approximately $57.3 million. Other
non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $309.8 million, retail revenues of approximately $86.9 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $66.3 million, and other
revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $52 million. The full year of operations at Wynn Macau during 2007 compared to only 117 days in 2006 was the primary contributor to the increase in the food and beverage, retail
and other revenues. Entertainment revenues decreased slightly due to the closure of the Le Réve theater during March 2007 for renovations.

Departmental, administrative and other expenses

During the year ended December 31, 2007, departmental expenses
included casino expenses of $1,168.1 million, rooms expenses of $83.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $212.6 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $161.1 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of



approximately $310.8 million and approximately $36.1 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31,
2006, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $439.9 million, room expenses of $73.9 million, food and beverage expenses of $194.4 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $134.5 million. Also included are general and
administrative expenses of approximately $231.5 million and approximately $21.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. The increase in expenses is due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of operations of Wynn Macau,
including the 39 percent gross win tax on casino revenue, and increases in Wynn Las Vegas expenses commensurate with the increase in revenues.

Pre-opening costs

Pre-opening costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 of $7.1 million decreased by $55.7 million
when compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to the opening of Wynn Macau in 2006. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007 related to advertising costs associated with the opening of
“Monty Python’s Spamalot” at Wynn Las Vegas as well as costs related to Encore and the expansion of Wynn Macau.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2007 of $219.9 million
increased by $44.5 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to a full year of depreciation expense associated with Wynn Macau as well as the placement into service of Wynn Macau’s expansion.

During the construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of
assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these properties opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. The depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful
lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful lives of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets. When circumstances require a revision to those estimates of useful life, we adjust them accordingly.

The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire
in June 2022 and 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to Wynn Las Vegas.

Contract termination fee

In February 2006, we agreed with the producers of Avenue Q to end Avenue
Q’s exclusive Las Vegas run at Wynn Las Vegas’ Broadway Theater at the end of May 2006. To terminate the contract, we paid a termination fee of $5 million.

Property charges and other

In response to our evaluation of the completed Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn
Macau properties and the reactions of our guests, we have made and continue to make enhancements and refinements to our properties. Costs relating to assets retired or abandoned as a result of these enhancements and remodel efforts for the year
ended December 31, 2007 of $70.2 million have been expensed as property charges. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2007 included the following charges at Wynn Macau: (a) a $10 million charge for the
abandonment of our parking garage to make way for Encore at Wynn Macau, (b) a $10.2 million charge related to abandonment costs for portions of the main kitchen, warehouse and restaurants to enable the main casino to be connected with the
expansion that opened in December 2007, (c) a $22.1 million charge related to significant casino and retail reconfigurations in the expansion that opened in December 2007, and (d) a $15.5 million charge related to the abandonment of a
theater. The remaining property charges were related to renovations to portions of the Le Rêve Theater, the abandonment of a marquee sign and the conversion of two



retail outlets and a nightclub at Wynn Las Vegas, as well as the remodeling of certain areas at Wynn Macau. Offsetting these charges for the year ended
December 31, 2007 is a gain of $9.4 million on the sale of a company aircraft.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, we
remodeled the six North Fairway Villas, several areas of the retail promenade, a portion of the baccarat area to feature a casino bar, improved public baccarat space and private baccarat salons and converted the Keno lounge to a retail outlet for
womens’ accessories at Wynn Las Vegas. In December 2006, Wynn Macau donated an early Ming dynasty vase to the Macau Museum. We purchased the vase in May 2006 for approximately $10.1 million. The vase had been on public display at Wynn Macau
prior to its donation to the museum. The $10.1 million expense for the donation of the Ming Vase is included in Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Other non-operating costs and expenses

Interest income increased by $0.2 million to $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006.

Interest expense was $143.8 million, net of capitalized interest of $44.6 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $148 million, net of capitalized interest of $29.5 million, for the year ended
December 31, 2006. Total interest cost increased approximately $10.7 million due to our $1 billion Wynn Resorts term loan facility, approximately $4.4 million related to the additional $400 million Wynn Las Vegas first mortgage notes issued in
November 2007 and approximately $2.0 million related to borrowings under our existing credit facilities and other debt. These increases were offset by approximately $6.2 million less interest due to the conversion of the Debentures in July 2007, as
well as an increase of $15.1 million in capitalized interest related to our construction activities.

Our interest rate swaps are accounted
for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended. The fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of our
interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase (or decrease) in swap fair value in each period. We recorded an expense of approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 resulting from the decrease in the fair value of our
interest rate swaps from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2006 we recorded a gain of $1.2 million resulting from the increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31,
2005 and December 31, 2006. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”.

Gain on sale of subconcession right

On March 4, 2006, we entered into an agreement with Publishing & Broadcasting, Ltd. (PBL) pursuant to which we agreed to sell to PBL for $900 million, the right to negotiate with the government of Macau for a subconcession to
allow PBL to operate casinos in Macau.

On September 8, 2006, the government of Macau approved the subconcession and on
September 11, 2006, PBL paid $900 million in cash to Wynn Macau, S.A. for the subconcession right. As a result of the sale and the subconcession awarded to PBL by the government of Macau, we have no continuing rights or obligations with respect
to the subconcession. All rights and obligations under the subconcession are between PBL and the government of Macau. The proceeds from this sale, net of related costs, are recorded as gain on sale of subconcession right, net in our Consolidated
Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Income taxes

Our effective tax rate of 21.1% was lower than the U.S. Federal rate of 35% primarily due to the portion of Macau earnings that we consider permanently
invested abroad, the lower tax rates applicable to our foreign income, and the tax holiday applicable to the earnings of Wynn Macau S.A. as described below.



Effective December 31, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received a 5-year exemption from Macau’s 12%
Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $26.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively, in such taxes. Our non-gaming profits
remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and our casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow from Operations

Net cash provided from operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $523.2 million compared to $659.2 million provided by operations for the
year ended December 31, 2007.

Capital Resources

We require a certain amount of cash on hand for operations. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents available for operations, debt service and retirement, development
activities, general corporate purposes, enhancements to our properties, funding the remaining construction and retention payables related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas (approximately $202 million) and to support the development and construction costs
of Encore at Wynn Macau. Approximately $662.3 million of our cash balance is held by Wynn Resorts, Limited, which is not a guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. In addition, as of
December 31, 2008, we had availability under our Wynn Macau Senior Revolving Credit Facility of $500 million. On February 4, 2009, we borrowed this remaining availability of $500 million under the Wynn Macau Senior Revolving Credit
Facility and increased our cash balances accordingly. Except for scheduled quarterly payments on two notes payable, we have no outstanding debt maturities until June 2010. We believe that cash flow from operations and our existing cash balances will
be adequate to satisfy our anticipated uses of capital during 2009. However, due to the negative business trends discussed herein, our Las Vegas and Wynn Macau cash flows from operations may continue to significantly decrease which may require
additional financing. We cannot provide assurance that future borrowings will be available.

Cash and cash equivalents include investments
in U.S. Treasury Bills and bank time deposits, all with maturities of less than 90 days.

Investing Activities

Capital expenditures were approximately $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 and related primarily to the construction of Encore at Wynn
Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Macau.

Encore at Wynn Las Vegas

On April 28, 2006, we commenced construction on Encore at Wynn Las Vegas which opened on December 22, 2008. Total costs of the project did not
exceed our project budget of approximately $2.3 billion for Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and related capital improvements. The project has been funded with proceeds from our Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities and operating cash flow from Wynn Las Vegas.
To the extent additional funds are required to pay the remaining construction and retention payables or other needs, we anticipate that we will fund these amounts by additional equity contributions to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. Subsequent to
December 31, 2008, Wynn Resorts made $100 million of such contributions.

Encore at Wynn Macau

In June 2007, we commenced construction on Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau. Encore at Wynn Macau is a second hotel tower for Wynn
Macau situated on top of a new low-rise podium. We expect Encore at Wynn Macau to open in 2010.



Design of the project continues to progress and current construction activities as of February 2009
include the following:

•

The tower portion of the low-rise podium is under construction and the tower has reached the 41st floor;

•

Exterior glass installation has reached the 20th floor;

•

Interior fit-out has commenced;

•

The basement structure has been completed; and

•

The central plant (located on the roof of Wynn Macau) is complete.

In July 2007, Wynn Macau S.A. issued a notice to proceed and on November 8, 2007, executed a guaranteed maximum price contract for $347.8 million with Leighton Contractors (Asia) Limited, China State Construction
Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited and China Construction Engineering (Macau) Company Limited, acting together as the general contractor for the construction of the Encore at Wynn Macau.

We expect total development and construction costs to be approximately $700 million for Encore at Wynn Macau. We anticipate that the project budget will
be funded from our cash flow from operations at Wynn Macau and funds drawn on February 4, 2009 from our Wynn Macau Senior Revolving Credit Facilities.

As of December 31, 2008, we had incurred approximately $202 million of project costs related to the development and construction of Encore at Wynn Macau.

Financing Activities

Wynn Resorts, Limited

On June 6, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.2 billion. On July 10, 2008, our
Board of Directors authorized an increase of $500 million to the previously announced equity repurchase program bringing the total authorized to $1.7 billion. The repurchase program may include repurchases from time to time through open market
purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 10,915,633 shares at a net cost of $940.1 million. As of
December 31, 2008, we had repurchased a total of 12,804,954 shares of our common stock for a net cost of $1.1 billion under the program.

Restricted cash decreased approximately $500 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, as such cash was used to purchase shares of our stock as discussed above.

On June 21, 2007, we entered into a $1 billion term loan facility (the “Term Loan”). The Term Loan was available to fund (a) our
equity repurchase program announced on June 7, 2007 and (b) up to $350 million for general corporate purposes. All amounts under this facility were borrowed as of December 31, 2007 and no additional amounts are available. On
November 26, 2008, we purchased $625 million of the loans at a discounted price of 95.375%, resulting in the retirement of $625 million of principal at a cost of $596.1 million. The remaining $375 million will mature and be payable on
June 21, 2010.

At our election, the Term Loan accrues interest at either LIBOR
or a Base Rate, plus a borrowing margin as described below. Interest on LIBOR loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period in the case of interest periods of one, two or three months, and every three months in the case of interest
periods of nine months or longer. Base Rate loans bear interest at (a) the greater of (i) the rate most recently announced by Deutsche Bank as its “prime rate,” or (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus


/


of 1% per annum; plus (b) a borrowing margin as described below. Interest on Base Rate loans are payable quarterly in
arrears. The borrowing margin is 2.25% for LIBOR loans and 1% for Base Rate loans, if our net liquidity is equal to or greater than $400 million and 2.50%



for LIBOR loans and 1.25% for Base Rate loans, if our net liquidity is less than $400 million. For borrowings under the Term Loan, we have historically
elected interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% on the outstanding balance.

On November 18, 2008, we completed a secondary common
stock offering of 8 million shares resulting in net proceeds of $344.3 million. These funds were included in our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2008.

Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas

As of December 31, 2008, our Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities consist of a $900 million revolving credit facility (the “Wynn Las Vegas Revolver”) and $225 million term loan facility (the “Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan”)
(together, the “Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities”). For borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan we have historically elected Eurodollar loans which bear interest at the 1-month LIBOR and include a margin of 1.875% on that outstanding
balance. We had a $200 million notional amount interest rate swap to essentially fix the interest on $200 million of the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan at the rate of 5.7% per annum that expired in December 2008. (For further information, see
Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk”.)

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we
borrowed $879.5 million under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. We also have $20.1 million of outstanding letters of credit that reduce our availability under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. Consequently, as of December 31, 2008, approximately $0.4
million remained available under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver for future borrowings. For borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver, we have historically elected Eurodollar loans, which bear interest at the 1-month LIBOR and currently include a
margin of 1.625% on the outstanding balance. Beginning June 30, 2009, the margin will fluctuate between a range of 1 to 1.75%, depending on our leverage ratio. In addition to interest, we also pay quarterly in arrears, an annual rate of
0.375% on the daily average of unborrowed availability. Beginning June 30, 2009, the annual fee that we will be required to pay for unborrowed availability is based on our leverage ratio and will range from an annual rate of 0.25% to
0.50%.

The $900 million Wynn Las Vegas Revolver will terminate and be payable in full on August 15, 2011. The Wynn Las Vegas Term
Loan will mature in two installments: $112.5 million will be payable on September 30, 2012 and the remaining $112.5 million will be payable on August 15, 2013.

The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities are obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and are guaranteed by and secured by substantially all of the assets (except the corporate aircraft) of each of its subsidiaries (other than
Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC). The obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities rank pari passu in right of payment with their existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness with
respect to the First Mortgage Notes and senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness.

On
September 17, 2008, Wynn Las Vegas entered into a third amendment to its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of August 15, 2006, as amended April 9, 2007 and as further amended October 31, 2007. This amendment, among
other things, provides Wynn Las Vegas with additional flexibility with respect to its financial covenants and related financial calculations.

The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities contain customary covenants restricting our activities including, but not limited to: the ability to sell assets, make capital expenditures, enter into capital leases, make loans or other investments and
incur additional indebtedness. In addition, we were required by the financial covenants to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined, not greater than 5.00 to 1 as of December 31, 2008, and Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as
defined, not less than 1.40 to 1. Management believes that we were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2008. The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is 5.00 to 1, 8.25 to 1, 7.75 to 1 and 7.50 to 1 for each of the reporting periods ending
March 31, 2009, June 30, 2009, September 30,



2009 and December 31, 2009, respectively. The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is 1.35 to 1 for the reporting period ending March 31, 2008, and
then increases to 1.75 to 1 for the reporting periods ending June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009, and 2.00 to 1 for the reporting period ending December 31, 2009.

Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau

On June 27, 2007, Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A., amended its credit facility, dated September 14, 2005 (“Amended Common Terms Agreement”), and entered into other related amendments and agreements with a syndicate of lenders.
The Amended Common Terms Agreement and related agreements took effect on June 29, 2007 and expanded availability under Wynn Macau, S.A.’s existing senior bank facility from $764 million to $1.550 billion, in a combination of Hong Kong and
U.S. dollars, including a $550 million equivalent fully-funded senior term loan facility (the “Wynn Macau Term Loan”), and a $1 billion senior revolving credit facility (the “Wynn Macau Revolver”) (together the “Wynn Macau
Credit Facilities”). Wynn Macau, S.A. also has the ability to increase the total facilities by an additional $50 million pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Amended Common Terms Agreement.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we borrowed approximately $500 million under the Wynn Macau Revolver which left remaining availability of
$500 million. We borrowed this remaining availability of $500 million on February 4, 2009, which was added to our cash balances.

The
Wynn Macau Term Loan matures in June 2014, and the Wynn Macau Revolver matures in June 2012. The principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in September 2011. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau
Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%.

Collateral for the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities consists of
substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. Certain affiliates that own interests in Wynn Macau, S.A., either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, have executed guarantees of the loans and pledged their interests in Wynn Macau,
S.A. as additional security for repayment of the loans.

The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain customary covenants restricting our
activities including, but not limited to: the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on any of its property, sales and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose of assets, and make loans or other investments.
In addition, we were required by the financial covenants to maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined, not greater than 4.75 to 1 as of December 31, 2008, and Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, not less than 2.00 to 1. Management believes that we
were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2008. The Leverage Ratio increases to not greater than 5.00 to 1 for all reporting periods in 2009.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in
any derivatives except for previously discussed interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $20.1
million.



Contractual Obligation and Commitments

The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments at December 31, 2008 (amounts in millions):

[1]

On February 4, 2009 we borrowed the remaining availability of $500 million under the Wynn Macau Revolver. The Wynn Macau Revolver matures in June 2012.

[2]

Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and LIBOR or HIBOR rates at December 31, 2008.
Such rates are at historical lows as of December 31, 2008 and have been very volatile in recent months. Actual rates will vary.

[3]

Other includes open purchase orders, commitments for aircraft purchases, land concession and fixed gaming tax payments in Macau and other contracts. As further discussed in
Item 8 “Financial Statements”, Note 17 “Income Taxes”, of this report, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48, on January 1, 2007. We had $120.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2008. Due to the
inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2008.

Other Liquidity Matters

Wynn Resorts is a
holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is highly dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries’ ability to provide funds to us. Restrictions imposed by our subsidiaries’ debt instruments
significantly restrict the ability to pay dividends. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture governing the First Mortgage Notes from making certain “restricted payments” as
defined in the indenture. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial
and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. The credit facilities of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. contain similar restrictions; although the Wynn Macau, S.A. loan agreements permit distribution of the net proceeds of the
subconcession sale and, provided certain conditions are met, earnings and loan proceeds. Further, the $1 billion Term Loan places various restrictions on the ability to pay dividends.

Wynn Las Vegas, LLC intends to fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and to the extent additional funds are required,
with additional contributions from Wynn Resorts or additional indebtedness to be incurred by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. We cannot assure you that Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future contributions from Wynn
Resorts or the availability of additional indebtedness will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs. We expect that Wynn Macau will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.’s
debt service obligations with existing cash and operating cash flow. However, we cannot assure you that such operating cash flows and existing cash will be sufficient to do so. We may seek to refinance all or a portion of



our indebtedness on or before maturity. Continued volatility in the capital markets may affect our ability to refinance debt or access those markets for
additional borrowings or may increase costs associated with borrowing funds. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.

New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to
develop additional gaming or related businesses in Las Vegas, as well as other domestic and international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any other development would require
us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau-related entities.

Wynn Resorts’ articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its common stock, that are owned
or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by our Board of Directors. The redemption price
may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt
to equity ratio and would increase our leverage ratio.

Credit Rating

As of February 26, 2009, the Company had a rating of “BB” with a “negative” outlook by Standard & Poors and a rating of
“Ba3” with a “negative” outlook by Moody’s Investors Service. For future borrowings, any decrease in our corporate rating could result in an increase in borrowing costs.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require management apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management
evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty rewards, self insurance, contingencies, litigation and other items.
Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and
therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.

Development, Construction and Property and Equipment Estimates

During the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. In connection with the
construction and development of our properties, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings. Once our properties open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer
charged as pre-opening costs. Start-up costs relating to Encore at Wynn Macau will be charged to pre-opening costs until it is completed and opened.

During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of our properties, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the
recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are placed in service. Upon the opening of our
properties, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resort’s fixed assets.



The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed.

Our leasehold interest in land in Macau under the land concession contract entered into in June 2004 is being amortized over 25 years, to the initial
term of the concession contract, which currently terminates in June 2029. Depreciation on a majority of the assets comprising Wynn Macau commenced in September of 2006, when Wynn Macau opened. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is
deemed to be the remaining life of the gaming concession, which currently expires in June 2022. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau will generally be charged over shorter periods when compared to Wynn Las Vegas.

Costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or
otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income or loss.

We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For assets to be disposed of, we
recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment
whenever indicators of impairment exist. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no
impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under
development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.

Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts Receivable

A substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. Credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at Wynn Las Vegas. While
offered, the issuance of credit at Wynn Macau is less significant when compared to Wynn Las Vegas. Our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their
balances in a timely fashion. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers issued at Wynn Las Vegas are generally legally
enforceable instruments in the United States, and United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.

The enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the United States varies from country to country. Some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related
debt, or make enforcement burdensome. We closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the United States. In addition to our internal credit and
collection departments, located in both Las Vegas and Macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.

As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, approximately 78% and 65% of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign
countries, primarily in Asia. In addition to enforceability issues, the collectibility of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the
customers’ home countries.

We regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as
management’s prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions.



The following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (amounts in
thousands):

The increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable
is due to a change in our reserve estimates effective September 2008, as a result of the current global economic uncertainty. Our reserve for doubtful casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the
risk assessments and judgments by our employees regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy. Our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at Wynn Las Vegas, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. As
of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, approximately 29% and 25% respectively, of our outstanding casino account receivable balance originated at Wynn Macau.

As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for
doubtful accounts expense may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as we become aware of additional information about a customer or
changes in a region’s economy or legal system.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate
borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. Derivative
financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income or comprehensive income, as applicable. As of December 31, 2008, changes in the swap fair values are being recorded in our
Consolidated Statements of Income, as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Share-Based Compensation

SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services
or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of
employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. We adopted this statement on January 1, 2006 under the modified
prospective method and use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value the equity instruments issued. The Black-Scholes valuation model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of options granted, and
expected rates of dividends. Management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our Company.

In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107, “Share-Based Payment” to provide interpretive guidance
on SFAS No. 123(R) valuation methods, assumptions used in valuation models, and the interaction of SFAS No. 123(R) with existing SEC guidance. SAB No. 107 also requires the classification of stock compensation expense in the same
financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative
expenses (including corporate expenses).



Significant Judgmental Accruals

We estimate liabilities for certain self-insurance, customer loyalty program reward redemptions, contingencies, claims and litigation and other items, as
appropriate. Management determines the adequacy of these estimates by reviewing the expected trends and from industry experience and adjusts the assumptions utilized as it believes necessary.

Income Taxes

We are subject to
income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. SFAS No. 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax
assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on
the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

SFAS No. 109 requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. During our development stage, we
accumulated significant net operating losses, which generated significant deferred tax assets. Because of our limited operating history, we previously fully reserved these net deferred tax assets. On September 11, 2006, we recorded a gain of
$899.4 million on the sale of the subconcession right. Accordingly we determined that a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets had become more likely than not realizable as defined by SFAS No. 109.

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities in the locations where we
operate. We assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”) “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes” which we adopted on January 1, 2007. The Interpretation prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, our
income tax recognition policy related to uncertain income tax positions is no longer covered by SFAS No. 5.

FIN 48 applies to all tax
positions related to income taxes subject to SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 utilizes a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when we conclude that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than
not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than
not to be realized upon settlement. FIN 48’s use of the term “more likely than not” is consistent with how that term is used in SFAS No. 109 (i.e. likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%).

The tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are to be recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the “more
likely than not” standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the “more likely than not” standard, the tax position must be derecognized. FIN 48 specifically prohibits the use of
a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions. As applicable, we will recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized no amounts for interest or penalties.

Effective September 6, 2006, we received a
5-year exemption from Macau’s 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, during 2008 we were exempted from the payment of approximately $27.7



million in such taxes. Wynn Macau’s non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and Wynn Macau’s casino winnings remain
subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”. This statement defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair
value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, which defers the effective date of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the entity’s financial
statements on a recurring basis to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We partially adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 effective January 1, 2008 and expect to adopt the remaining
provisions of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2009. The partial adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” SFAS No. 159 permits
entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 on January 1, 2008, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141 (revised) establishes principles
and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. The revision is intended to
simplify existing guidance and converge rulemaking under U.S. GAAP with international accounting rules. This statement applies prospectively to business combinations where the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual
reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 141 (revised) is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB
No. 51.” This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also clarifies that a noncontrolling
interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented by requiring
consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amount attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interests. The statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosure that clearly
identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent and those of the noncontrolling owners. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 is not expected to have
a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
“Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS No. 133”. SFAS No. 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced
disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS No. 161
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments
That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (the “FSP”). The FSP requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion to separately account for the
liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years and does not permit earlier application. However, the transition guidance requires retrospective application to all periods presented and does not grandfather existing instruments.
We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the FSP will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2008, the
FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. This FSP addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities
prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share (“EPS”) under the two-class method described in paragraphs 60 and 61 of FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share. The
FSP will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. All prior period EPS data presented shall be adjusted retrospectively to conform to the provisions of this FSP. We are
currently evaluating the impact of this FSP, but do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active (FSP 157-3 or the FSP). FSP 157-3 clarifies the
application of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement

s

(Statement 157), in a market that is not active. The FSP amends Statement 157 to include an example that illustrates key considerations when applying the principles in Statement 157 to
financial assets when the market for these instruments is not active.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.

Interest Rate Risks

One of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated
with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing
Activities.” We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as believed by us to be appropriate. We cannot assure you that these
risk management strategies have had the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations.

The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments at December 31, 2008 of our expected long-term indebtedness. However, we cannot predict the LIBOR or HIBOR rates that
will be in effect in the future. As of December 31, 2008, such rates were at historic lows and have been very volatile in recent months. Actual rates will vary. The one-month LIBOR and HIBOR rates at December 31, 2008 of 0.436% and 0.299%,
respectively were used for all variable rate calculations in the table below. The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents.

Interest Rate Swap Information

We have entered into floating-for-fixed interest rate swap arrangements relating to certain of our floating-rate debt facilities. We account for these
swaps under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations.

Wynn Resorts

On February 1, 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on all of the borrowings under the $1 billion
Term Loan, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25%. Pursuant to the terms of this interest rate swap, we paid a fixed rate of 2.836% on the $1 billion notional amount and received payments based on LIBOR. This swap fixed the interest rate at
approximately 5.09%. On December 8, 2008, we modified the terms of this swap so that the current notional amount is $375 million, which matches the current debt outstanding. Pursuant to the amendment, we now pay a fixed rate of 3.95% which
fixes the interest rate at approximately 6.2%. Changes in the fair value of this interest rate swap have and will continue to be recorded as an increase/decrease in swap fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Income as the swap does not
qualify for hedge accounting. This swap matures in June 2010.

Wynn Las Vegas

On December 31, 2008, our interest rate swap at Wynn Las Vegas matured. This interest rate swap arrangement was intended to hedge the underlying
interest rate risk on a total of $200 million of borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.875%. Under this interest rate swap



arrangement, we received payments at a variable rate of LIBOR and paid a fixed rate of 3.793% on the $200 million notional amount. Although this interest
rate swap was highly effective economically in fixing the interest rate on borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan at approximately 5.7%, changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap for each reporting period was recorded as an
increase/decrease in swap fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Income, as the swap did not qualify for hedge accounting.

Wynn
Macau

As of December 31, 2008, we had two interest rate swaps intended to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on
borrowings under the Wynn Macau Term Loan. Under the first swap agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 3.632% on U.S. dollar borrowings of $153.8 million incurred under the Wynn Macau Term Loan in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a
variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. Under the second swap agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 3.39% on Hong Kong dollar borrowings of approximately HK $991.6 million (approximately U.S. $127.9 million)
incurred under the Wynn Macau Term Loan in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. The term of both swap agreements is from August 2008 through
August 2011.

These interest rate swaps fix the interest rates on the current U.S. dollar and Hong Kong dollar borrowings under the
Wynn Macau Term Loan at approximately 5.382% and 5.14%, respectively. However, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period recorded are, and will continue to be, recognized as an increase/decrease in swap fair
value in our Consolidated Statements of Income, as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Summary of Historical Fair Values

The following table presents the historical asset or liability fair values as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, of our interest rate
swap arrangements (amounts in thousands):

The fair value approximates the amount we would receive (pay) if these contracts were settled at
the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to
significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods.

Other Interest Rate Swap Information

The following table provides information about our interest rate swaps, by contractual maturity dates, as of December 31, 2008 and
using estimated future LIBOR and HIBOR rates based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve. The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is the Company’s reporting currency:



We do not use derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

As of December 31, 2008, approximately 55% of our long-term debt was based on fixed rates, including the notional amounts related to interest rate
swaps. Based on our borrowings as of December 31, 2008, an assumed 1% change in variable rates would cause our annual interest cost to change by $19.5 million.

Foreign Currency Risks

The currency delineated in Wynn Macau’s concession agreement with the
government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar
and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to
potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments.

If the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca are not linked to the U.S. dollar in the future, severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies may result. We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the
applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level.

Because many of Wynn Macau’s payment and
expenditure obligations are in Macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable Macau pataca or Hong Kong dollar rate changes, Wynn Macau’s obligations, as denominated in U.S. dollars, would increase. In addition, because we expect that most of the
revenues for any casino that Wynn Macau operates in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars, we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. Also, if any of our Macau-related
entities incur U.S. dollar-denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on Wynn Macau’s results of operations, financial condition,
and ability to service its debt. To date, we have not engaged in hedging activities intended to protect against foreign currency risk.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Wynn Resorts, Limited:

We have audited Wynn Resorts, Limited and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based
on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2008 and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Wynn Resorts, Limited:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wynn Resorts, Limited and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the index at item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedules are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company
at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of their income and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with FASB
Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” on January 1, 2007.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Organization

Wynn Resorts, Limited, a Nevada
corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Wynn Resorts” or the “Company”), was formed in June 2002 and completed an initial public offering of its common stock on October 25, 2002.

In June 2002, the Company’s indirect subsidiary, Wynn Resorts (Macau), S.A. (“Wynn Macau, S.A.”), entered into an agreement with the
government of the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (“Macau”), granting Wynn Macau, S.A. the right to construct and operate one or more casino gaming properties in Macau. Wynn Macau, S.A.’s
first casino resort in Macau is hereinafter referred to as “Wynn Macau”.

The Company currently owns and operates three casino
hotel resort properties, Wynn Las Vegas, which opened on April 28, 2005, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which opened on December 22, 2008, and Wynn Macau, which opened on September 6, 2006. In addition, the Company is constructing Encore
at Wynn Macau which will be fully integrated with Wynn Macau and is expected to open in 2010.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of
Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned
subsidiaries. Investments in the 50%-owned joint ventures operating the Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership and the Brioni mens’ retail clothing store inside Wynn Las Vegas are accounted for under the equity method. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments with purchase maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash held at
December 31, 2007, consisted primarily of certain proceeds of the Company’s financing activities invested in approved money market funds. The majority of these funds were restricted by agreements governing debt instruments for the purchase
of the Company’s common stock and the payment of certain construction and development costs relating to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.

Accounts
Receivable and Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist
principally of casino accounts receivable. The Company issues credit in the form of markers to approved casino customers following investigations of creditworthiness. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately 78%



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

and 65%, respectively, of the Company’s markers were due from customers residing outside the United States, primarily in Asia. Business or economic
conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectibility of such receivables.

Accounts receivable,
including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems them to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when
received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts as well
as management’s experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions.

Inventories

Inventories consist of retail merchandise, food and beverage items which are stated at the lower of cost or market value and certain operating
supplies. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out, average and specific identification methods.

Property and Equipment

Purchases of property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line
method as follows:

Buildings and improvements

10 to 45 years

Land improvements

10 to 45 years

Leasehold interest in land

25 years

Airplanes

7 to 20 years

Furniture, fixtures and equipment

3 to 20 years

Costs related to improvements are capitalized, while costs of building repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income.

Capitalized Interest

The interest cost associated
with major development and construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project. Interest capitalization ceases once a project is substantially complete or no longer undergoing construction activities to prepare it for its
intended use. When no debt is specifically identified as being incurred in connection with a construction project, the Company capitalizes interest on amounts expended on the project at the Company’s weighted average cost of borrowed money.
Interest of $87.4 million, $44.6 million and $29.5 million was capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Intangibles

The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of water rights acquired as part of the
original overall purchase price of the property on which Wynn Las Vegas is located, and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually. The Company’s finite-lived intangible assets
consist of a Macau gaming concession and show production rights. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of their contractual terms or estimated useful lives.



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, which are to be held and used, including intangibles and property and equipment, are periodically reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. If an indicator of impairment exists, the Company compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows
exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then impairment is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value, with fair value typically based on a
discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.

Deferred Financing Costs

Direct and incremental costs incurred in obtaining loans or in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are capitalized and
amortized to interest expense over the terms of the related debt agreements. Approximately $17.8 million, $13.2 million and $14.4 million was amortized to interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Debt discounts incurred in connection with the issuance of debt have been capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company seeks to manage its market risk, including interest
rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings with the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. The fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at each
balance sheet date, with changes in fair value affecting net income or comprehensive income as applicable. The Company’s current interest rate swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest
rate swaps are presented as an increase (decrease) in swap fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

Revenue Recognition and
Promotional Allowances

The Company recognizes revenues at the time persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is
provided or the retail goods are sold, prices are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.

Casino revenues are measured
by the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs and for chips in the customers’ possession. Hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other
operating revenues are recognized when services are performed. Advance deposits on rooms and advance ticket sales are recorded as customer deposits until services are provided to the customer.

Revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) consensus on Issue 01-9,
“Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products).” EITF 01-9 requires that sales incentives be recorded as a reduction of revenue; consequently, the Company’s casino
revenues are reduced by discounts, commissions and points earned in customer loyalty programs, such as the player’s club loyalty program.



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without
charge is included in gross revenues and then deducted as promotional allowances. The estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances is primarily included in casino expenses as follows (amounts in thousands):

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising costs incurred in development periods are included in pre-opening costs. Once a project is completed, advertising costs
are included in general and administrative expenses. Total advertising costs were $31.2 million including $11.1 million in pre-opening related to Encore, $25.8 million and $19.9 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006.

Pre-Opening Costs

Pre-opening costs consists primarily of direct salaries and wages, legal and consulting fees, insurance, utilities and advertising, and are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred pre-opening costs in connection with Wynn Macau, prior to
its opening on September 6, 2006 and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, prior to its opening on December 22, 2008, and continues to incur such costs related to Encore at Wynn Macau.

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign
jurisdictions where it operates. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. SFAS No. 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and
liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and
deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

SFAS
No. 109 requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. During the Company’s development stage, it accumulated significant
net operating losses, which generated significant deferred tax assets. Because of the Company’s limited operating history, it had previously fully reserved these net deferred tax assets. On September 11, 2006, the Company recorded a gain
of $899.4 million on the sale of the subconcession right. Accordingly the Company determined that a substantial portion of these net deferred tax assets have become more likely than not realizable as defined by SFAS No. 109.



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company’s income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) and other tax authorities in the locations where it operates. The Company assesses potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”) “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” which the Company adopted on January 1, 2007. The Interpretation prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to
meet before being recognized in the financial statements. As a result, the Company’s income tax recognition policy related to uncertain income tax positions is no longer covered by SFAS No. 5.

FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 utilizes a two-step approach for evaluating tax
positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only addressed if the position is deemed to be
more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. FIN 48’s use of the term “more likely than not” is
consistent with how that term is used in SFAS No. 109 (i.e. likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%).

The tax positions failing
to qualify for initial recognition are to be recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the “more likely than not” standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets
the “more likely than not” standard, it is required that the tax position is derecognized. FIN 48 specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions. As applicable, the Company will
recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized no amounts for interest or penalties.

Currency Translation

The Company accounts for
currency translation in accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation.” Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurements are included in other income/expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The results of
operations and the balance sheet of Wynn Macau, S.A. are translated from Macau Patacas to U.S. dollars. Balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average
rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.

Earnings Per Share

Earnings per share are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share." SFAS
No. 128 provides for the reporting of “basic”, or undiluted earnings per share (“EPS”), and “diluted” EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during
the year. Diluted EPS reflects the addition of potentially dilutive securities which for the Company includes: stock options, nonvested stock, and the 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2015 (the “Debentures”) which were all
converted into common stock in July 2007.



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares used in the calculation of basic
and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 consisted of the following (amounts in thousands):




Weighted average common shares outstanding (used in calculation of basic earnings per share)

108,408

106,030

99,998

Potential dilution from the assumed exercise of stock options, nonvested stock, and the Debentures

1,033

6,655

11,629

Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding (used in calculation of diluted earnings per share)

109,441

112,685

111,627

The calculation of diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes an addition to
net income to reflect the interest expense, net of related tax effects, of $5.1 million that would not have been incurred on the Debentures had they been converted as of the beginning of the year up to the conversion date.

The calculation of diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes an addition to net income to reflect the interest expense, net of
related tax effects, of $9.5 million and the distribution to convertible debenture holders of $58.5 million that would not have been incurred on the Debentures had they been converted as of the beginning of the year.

A total of 880,000 stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS at December 31, 2008 because including them would have been
anti-dilutive.

Share-Based Compensation

In accordance with SFAS 123(R), “Share Based Payment”, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the awards vesting period. SFAS 123(R) requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services
received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the estimated fair value for
each option grant issued. The Black-Scholes determined fair value net of estimated forfeitures is amortized as compensation cost on a straight line basis over the service period.

Further information on the Company’s share-based compensation arrangements is included in Note 15 “Benefit Plans—Share-Based
Compensation”.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this statement does not require any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, which
defers the effective date of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the entity’s financial statements on a recurring basis to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and
interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company partially adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 effective January 1, 2008 and expects to adopt the remaining provisions of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2009. The partial adoption of this
statement did not have a material impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses related
to these financial instruments reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of this statement on January 1, 2008, did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised
2007), “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141 (revised) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. The revision is intended to simplify existing guidance and converge rulemaking under U.S. GAAP with international accounting rules. This statement applies prospectively to business
combinations where the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 141 (revised) is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
“Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51.” This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent
and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS
No. 160 changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented by requiring consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amount attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interests. The statement also
establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosure that clearly identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent and those of the noncontrolling owners. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS
No. 133”. SFAS No. 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity’s
financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS No. 161 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt
Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (the “FSP”). The FSP requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion to separately account
for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years and does not permit earlier application. However, the transition guidance requires retrospective application to all periods presented and does not grandfather existing
instruments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the FSP will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. This FSP addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are
participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing EPS under the two-class method described in paragraphs 60 and 61 of



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share. The FSP will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2008. All prior period EPS data presented shall be adjusted retrospectively to conform to the provisions of this FSP. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this FSP, but does not expect it to have a material
impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-3,
Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active (FSP 157-3 or the FSP). FSP 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (Statement 157), in a market that is not active.
The FSP amends Statement 157 to include an example that illustrates key considerations when applying the principles in Statement 157 to financial assets when the market for these instruments is not active.

Show production rights represent amounts paid to purchase the rights to the “Le Rêve” and “Monty Python’s Spamalot”
production shows. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company wrote off the show production rights associated with Spamalot as the contract for that show was terminated. The Company expects that amortization of show production rights
will be approximately $2.1 million for each of the years 2009 through 2012, and approximately $0.8 million in 2013.

Water rights reflect
the fair value allocation determined in the purchase of the property on which Wynn Las Vegas is located in April 2000. The value of the trademarks primarily represents the costs to acquire the “Le Rêve” name. The water rights and

% First Mortgage Notes

On December 14, 2004,
Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. (together, the “Issuers”) issued $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes (the “First Mortgage Notes”). On November 6, 2007, the Issuers
issued, in a private offering, $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 at a price of 97.25% of the principal amount (the “Additional Notes”). The Additional Notes were issued under the same indenture
as the First Mortgage Notes issued on December 14, 2004. The First Mortgage Notes mature on December 1, 2014 and bear interest at the rate of 6 5/8% per year. The Company pays interest on the First Mortgage Notes on June 1st and
December 1st of each year. Commencing December 1, 2009, the First Mortgage Notes are redeemable at the Company’s option at a price equal to 103.313% of the principal amount redeemed and declining ratably on December 1st of each
year thereafter to zero on or after December 1, 2012.

The indenture governing the First Mortgage Notes and the Additional Notes
contains covenants limiting the ability of the Issuers to incur additional debt, make distributions, investments and restricted payments, create liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, sell assets, enter into sale leaseback transactions,
permit restrictions on dividends and other payments by subsidiaries, or engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of substantially all assets, sales of subsidiary stock and other specified types of transactions.



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The First Mortgage Notes and the Additional Notes are obligations of the Issuers, guaranteed by each
of the subsidiaries of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC. Wynn Resorts, Limited does not guarantee the obligations of the Issuers. Subject to an intercreditor agreement and certain exceptions, the First Mortgage Notes
and the guarantees thereof are secured by: (1) a first priority pledge of all of the member’s interests owned by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC in its subsidiaries (other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC) and of Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC's 100%
member's interest in Wynn Las Vegas, LLC; (2) first mortgages on all real property constituting Wynn Las Vegas, its golf course and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas; and (3) a first priority security interest in substantially all other existing
and future assets of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors, excluding, among other things, an aircraft beneficially owned by World Travel, LLC.

The obligations of the Issuers and the guarantors under the First Mortgage Notes and the Additional Notes rank equal to the right of payment with their existing and future senior secured indebtedness, including indebtedness with respect to
the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities described below, and rank senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness.

The Additional Notes rank pari passu with, and will vote on any matter submitted to note holders with, the previously issued First Mortgage Notes. The Additional Notes are senior secured obligations of the Issuers,
are guaranteed by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s subsidiaries (subject to some exceptions), and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the existing and future assets of the Issuers and guarantors.

The Additional Notes were registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and in May 2008, the Company completed an exchange of the Additional Notes for
registered, publicly traded notes that have substantially identical terms as the Additional Notes.

$1 Billion Term Loan Facility

On June 21, 2007, the Company entered into a $1 billion term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”). Borrowings under the Term Loan
Facility were available in the form of a delayed-draw term loan facility available through December 31, 2007, with the option to increase the facility to $1.25 billion if certain conditions are met. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had
borrowed $1 billion under the Term Loan Facility and no additional amounts are available. The Term Loan Facility was available to fund (a) the Company’s equity repurchase program announced on June 7, 2007 and (b) up to $350
million for general corporate purposes. Of the $1 billion drawn at December 31, 2007, $500 million was included as restricted cash in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as such amount was only to be used to fund the Company’s
equity repurchases or repay the loans.

On August 1, 2008, the Company amended the $1 billion Wynn Resorts Term Loan. This amendment

debt under the $1 billion Wynn Term Loan Facility from a third party. On November 13, 2008, the Company further amended the Term Loan Facility to purchase loans outstanding up to $650 million prior to March 31, 2009. On November 26,
2008, the Company purchased $625 million of loans under the Term Loan Facility at a discounted price of 95.375%, resulting in the retirement of $625 million of principal for a payment of $596.1 million. The loans purchased included the interests
held by Mr. Wynn. In connection with this transaction, the Company recognized a $22.3 million gain on early retirement of debt, net of the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and fees. The remaining $375 million will mature and be payable
on June 21, 2010.

Wynn Las Vegas Credit
Facilities

On December 14, 2004, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC entered into a credit agreement and related ancillary agreements for secured
revolving credit and term loan facilities in the aggregate amount of $1 billion. The credit facilities consisted of a revolving credit facility (the “Wynn Las Vegas Revolver”) in the amount of $600 million and a term loan facility (the
“Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan”) in the amount of $400 million. The Wynn Las Vegas Revolver was to terminate and be payable in full on December 14, 2009, and the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan was to mature on December 14, 2011.

On August 15, 2006, the Company refinanced the above noted credit facilities and entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the
“Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) which increased the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities from $1 billion to $1.125 billion by increasing the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver from $600 million to $900 million and reducing the Wynn Las Vegas
Term Loan from $400 million to $225 million. The $900 million Wynn Las Vegas Revolver and the $225 million Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan are herein referred to as the “Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities”. In August 2006, the maturity dates for
the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver and the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan were extended to August 15, 2011 and August 15, 2013, respectively. One half of the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan is due on September 30, 2012 and the remaining half is due
August 15, 2013.

For purposes of calculating interest, loans under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities will be designated, at the
election of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, as Eurodollar Loans or, in certain circumstances, Base Rate Loans. Eurodollar Loans under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver and Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan bear interest initially at the Eurodollar rate plus 1.625% and the
Eurodollar rate plus 1.875%, respectively. Interest on Eurodollar Loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period in the case of interest periods of one, two or three months, and every three months in the case of interest periods of
six months. Base Rate Loans bear interest at (a) the greater of (i) the rate most recently announced by Deutsche Bank as its “prime rate,” or (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1% per annum; plus (b) a
borrowing margin 0.625% or 0.875% under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver and Wynn Las Vegas Term Loans, respectively. Interest on Base Rate Loans will be payable quarterly in arrears.

Beginning June 30, 2009, the applicable borrowing margins for the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver will be based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s leverage
ratio, ranging from 1% to 1.75% per annum for Eurodollar Loans and 0% to 0.75% per annum for Base Rate Loans. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC also pays, quarterly in arrears, 0.375% per annum on the daily average of unborrowed availability under
the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. Beginning June 30, 2009, the annual fee Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will be required to pay for unborrowed availability under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver will be based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s leverage ratio, ranging
from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum.

Interest Rate Swaps

The Company has entered into
floating-for-fixed interest rate swap arrangements in order to manage interest rate risk relating to certain of its debt facilities. These interest rate swap agreements modify the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion
of the Company’s floating-rate debt to a fixed rate. The Company accounts for its interest rate swaps in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended. These interest
rate swaps essentially fix the interest rate at the percentages noted below, however, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps for each reporting period have been recorded in the increase/decrease in swap fair value in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income, as the interest rate swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.

The Company measures the fair value of
its interest rate swaps on a recurring basis pursuant to SFAS No. 157. SFAS No. 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as
observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no
market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company categorizes these swap contracts as Level 2.

The following table represents the historical asset (liability) fair values recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. The fair value approximates the amount the Company would
receive/(pay) if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other
market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability and fluctuation between periods.

Term Loan Facility. Pursuant to the terms of this interest rate swap, the Company paid a fixed rate of 2.836% on the $1 billion notional amount and received payments based on LIBOR. This swap fixed the interest rate at approximately 5.09%. On
December 8, 2008, the Company modified the terms of this swap so that the current notional amount is $375 million to match the current debt outstanding. Pursuant to the amendment, the Company now pays a fixed rate of 3.95% which fixes the
interest rate at approximately 6.2% through June 2010. This swap matures in June 2010.

Wynn Las Vegas Swap

In December 2008, the Company’s $200 million notional amount interest rate swap to essentially fix the interest rate on $200 million of the $225

rate at approximately 5.7% on $200 million of the outstanding $225 million term loan.

Wynn Macau Swaps

In November 2005, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on current and future
borrowings under the Wynn Macau Term Loan. In August 2008, the Company terminated these interest rate swaps and entered into new interest rate swaps which will mature in August 2011. Under the first terminated swap agreement, the Company paid a
fixed interest rate of 4.84% on borrowings incurred under the Wynn Macau Term Loan up to a maximum of approximately $198.2 million, in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of
payment. Under the second terminated swap agreement, the Company paid a fixed interest rate of 4.77% on borrowings incurred under the Wynn Macau Term Loan up to a maximum of approximately HK $1.1 billion (approximately U.S. $140 million), in
exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. The terminated interest rate swaps fixed the interest rates on the U.S. dollar and the Hong Kong dollar borrowings under the
Wynn Macau Term Loan at approximately 6.59% and 6.52%, respectively. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $0.9 million to reflect the increase in the value of such swaps from June 30, 2008 to the
termination date and paid to the counterparties of the terminated swaps a cash settlement payment of approximately $2.2 million.

Effective
August 2008, under the first new swap agreement, the Company pays a fixed interest rate of 3.632% on U.S. dollar borrowings of approximately $153.8 million incurred under the Wynn Macau Term Loan in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a

$127.9 million) incurred under the Wynn Macau Term Loan in exchange for receipt on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. These interest rate swaps fix the interest rates on the U.S.
dollar and the Hong Kong dollar borrowings under the Wynn Macau Term Loan at approximately 5.382% and 5.14%, respectively.

Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash distribution of $6 per share on its outstanding Common Stock. This distribution was paid on December 10, 2007 to stockholders of record on November 30, 2007. For the year ended
December 31, 2007, $686.1 million was recorded as a distribution in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Of this amount approximately $3.3 million was recorded as a liability which will be paid to the holders
of nonvested stock upon the vesting of that stock.

On November 13, 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash
distribution of $6 per share on its outstanding Common Stock. This distribution was paid on December 4, 2006, to stockholders of record as of November 23, 2006. As part of this distribution, the Company made a payment to the holders of its
Debentures so that they participated in the distribution to the same extent as if they had converted their Debentures to common stock. The Company paid holders of the Debentures a cash amount equal to $260.87 per $1,000 principal amount which
equates to $58.5 million. In accordance with the indenture governing the Debentures, as a result of the payment, no adjustment was made to the conversion price. The payment was recorded as a Distribution to Convertible Debenture Holders in the
accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income for the

Benefit Plans

Employee Savings Plan

The Company established a retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering its non-union employees in
July 2000. The plan allows employees to defer, within prescribed limits, a percentage of their income on a pre-tax basis through contributions to this plan. The Company matches the contributions, within prescribed limits, with an amount equal
to 100% of the participant’s initial 2% tax deferred contribution and 50% of the tax deferred contribution between 2% and 4% of the participant’s compensation. The Company recorded an expense for matching contributions of approximately
$5.3 million, $4.9 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Effective March 16, 2009, the Company is suspending matching contributions to this plan.

Union employees are covered by various multi-employer pension plans. The Company recorded an expense of approximately $4.6 million, $4.5 million and $4.6
million under such plans for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Information from the plans’ sponsors is not available to permit the Company to determine its share of unfunded vested benefits, if any.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company
established the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Stock Plan”) to provide for the grant of (i) incentive stock options, (ii) compensatory (i.e. nonqualified) stock options, and (iii) nonvested shares of Common Stock of Wynn
Resorts, Limited. Employees, directors (whether employee or nonemployee) and independent contractors or consultants of the Company are eligible to participate in the Stock Plan. However, only employees of the Company are eligible to receive
incentive stock options.

A maximum of 9,750,000 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance under the Stock Plan. As of
December 31, 2008, 3,124,212 shares remain available for the grant of stock options or nonvested shares of Common Stock.

Stock Options

Options are granted at the current market price at the date of grant. The Stock Plan provides for a variety of vesting schedules,
including: immediate; 25% each year over four years; 33.33% for each of the third, fourth and fifth years; cliff vesting at a determined date; and others to be determined at the time of grant. All options expire ten years from the date of grant.

A summary of option activity under the Stock Plan as of December 31, 2008, and the changes
during the year then ended is presented below:

The weighted average fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006 was $61.50, $52.40 and $31.01, respectively. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $6.1 million, $21.4 million and $72.5 million, respectively. Net cash
proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $2.8 million, $9.2 million, and $21.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. No tax benefits were recognized since these benefits did not reduce income taxes
payable.

Nonvested Shares

A summary
of the status of the Stock Plan’s nonvested shares as of December 31, 2008 and changes during the year then ended is presented below:

Compensation Cost

In March 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107, “Share-Based Payment” to provide interpretive guidance on SFAS No. 123(R) valuation methods, assumptions used in valuation models, and the interaction of
SFAS No. 123(R) with existing SEC guidance. SAB No. 107 also requires the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts the Company’s departmental
expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for the Company’s development projects, and the Company’s general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses).

The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the estimated fair value for each option grant issued, with highly subjective
assumptions, changes in which could materially affect the estimated fair value. Expected volatility is based on implied and historical factors related to the Company’s Common Stock.



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Expected term represents the weighted average time between the option’s grant date and its exercise date. The Company used the simplified method
prescribed by SAB No.’s 107 and 110 for companies with a limited trading history to estimate the expected term. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company used its best estimate and comparisons to industry peers. The risk-free
interest rate used for each period presented is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the period equal to the expected term.

The fair value per option was estimated on the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions:

The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) and the related interpretations on January 1, 2006
resulted in the Company’s elimination of approximately $15.8 million of deferred compensation against additional paid-in capital. The Company recognized approximately $11.7 million ($0.08 per basic and diluted share), approximately $10.9
million ($0.08 and $0.07, per basic and diluted share, respectively) and approximately $11.6 million ($0.08 and $0.07, per basic and diluted share, respectively) of compensation expense related to stock options for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In addition to compensation cost relating to stock options, during the year ended December 31,
2008, the Company recognized compensation expense related to nonvested shares of Common Stock of approximately $8.6 million ($0.07 per basic and diluted share). Approximately $56.6 million of unamortized compensation cost relating to nonvested
shares of Common Stock at December 31, 2008 will be recognized as compensation over the vesting period of the related grants through December 2016. The total fair value of the shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007,
and 2006 was $2.5 million, $3.9 million and $11.2 million, respectively.

During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
Company recognized compensation expense related to nonvested shares of Common Stock of approximately $7.6 million and $5.1 million ($0.05 and $0.03 per basic and diluted share) respectively. In addition, approximately $0.7 million and $1.3 million
was capitalized to construction in progress during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

The total compensation cost relating
both to stock options and nonvested stock is allocated as follows (amounts in thousands):

Sale of Macau Subconcession Right

On March 4,
2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. entered into an agreement with Publishing & Broadcasting, Ltd. (“PBL”) pursuant to which Wynn Macau, S.A. agreed to sell to PBL for $900 million, the right to negotiate with the government of Macau for a
subconcession to allow PBL to operate casinos in Macau.

On September 8, 2006, the government of Macau approved the sale of the
subconcession right. On September 11, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. completed the sale to PBL and received a cash payment of $900 million. As a result of the sale and the subconcession awarded to PBL by the government of Macau, Wynn Macau, S.A. has no
continuing rights or obligations with respect to the subconcession. The proceeds from this sale, net of related costs, are recorded as gain on sale of subconcession right in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended
December 31, 2006.

The tax effects of significant temporary differences representing net deferred tax assets and
liabilities consisted of the following (amounts in thousands):



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The income tax provision differs from that computed at the federal statutory corporate tax rate as
follows:

During its development stage, the Company accumulated significant net operating losses.
Accordingly, at December 31, 2007, the Company had estimated available tax loss carryforwards of approximately $510 million for U.S. income tax purposes, which were entirely used in 2008. The Company has foreign tax loss carryforwards of
approximately $268.4 million as of December 31, 2008, which are partially reserved and expire in 2010 and 2011. The Company’s U.S. tax loss carryforward included a tax deduction of $9.2 million associated with the conversion of the
Debentures into common stock; the tax benefit of $3.2 million was credited directly to shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2007. The Company has not recorded tax benefits resulting from the exercise of nonqualified stock options and
the value of vested restricted stock of $128.6 million, $120.6 million, and $92.2 million as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, in excess of the amounts reported for such items as compensation costs under SFAS No. 123(R)
that have not yet reduced income taxes payable. The company uses a with-and-without approach to determine if the excess tax deductions associated with compensation costs under SFAS No. 123(R) have reduced income taxes payable. The deferred tax
asset for net operating loss carryforwards in the above table of temporary differences excludes amounts relating to items that have not yet reduced taxes payable. Accordingly, no deferred tax asset has been recorded for these amounts. Subsequent
recognition of income tax benefits associated with these items will be allocated to additional paid-in capital.

SFAS No. 109 requires
recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. During 2008, the aggregate valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by $635.4
million and $3.4 million respectively. During 2006 the aggregate valuation allowance decreased by $107.6 million. The 2008 increase is primarily related to foreign tax credit carryforwards that are not considered more likely than not realizable. The
2007 increase is primarily due to foreign tax loss carryforwards that are not more likely than not realizable. The 2006 decrease was primarily due to the recognition of net U.S. deferred tax assets, the write off of foreign deferred tax assets
considered no longer realizable and the write off of tax loss carryforwards attributable to tax deductions in excess of the amounts reported as stock compensation costs under SFAS 123(R) that have not yet reduced income taxes payable under this
statement. The Company maintains valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that it determines are not yet more likely than not realizable.



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Of the December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 U.S. valuation allowances, approximately $3.8 million
for each year is attributable to syndication costs. Subsequent recognition of income tax benefits associated with this item will be allocated to additional paid-in capital.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company completed a study of the taxes, levies and obligations assessed on operations of Wynn Macau
under Macau law and its Macau Gaming Concession. As a result, the Company recognized tax benefits of $721.6 million (net of valuation allowance increases) for foreign tax credits applicable to the earnings of Wynn Macau. Of the $721.6 million,
$650.6 was used to offset 2008 U.S. income tax expense incurred as a result of the repatriation of Wynn Macau earnings and $71.0 million (net of valuation allowance) is recorded as a deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has
no earnings in foreign subsidiaries that are considered permanently invested.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had not
provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $494 million and $297.1 million, respectively, resulting from earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which were considered permanently
reinvested outside the United States. The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability without regard to potential foreign tax credits associated with these temporary differences is approximately $172.9 million and $103.9 million for the years
ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Effective September 6, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received a 5-year exemption from
Macau’s 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, the Company was exempted from the payment of approximately $27.7 million ($.26 and $.25 per basic and diluted share, respectively), $26.4 million ($0.25 and $0.23 per basic
and diluted share, respectively) and $4.7 million ($0.05 and $0.04 per basic and diluted share, respectively) in such taxes for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company’s non-gaming profits remain subject
to the Macau Complementary Tax and its casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company's income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) and other tax authorities in the locations where it operates. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has filed domestic income tax returns for the years 2002 to 2007 and foreign income tax returns for 2002 to 2007. The Company's
2002 to 2007 domestic income tax returns remain subject to examination by the IRS and the Company's 2006 and 2007 Macau income tax returns remain subject to examination by the Macau Finance Bureau. During 2007, the IRS commenced an examination of
the Company's U.S income tax returns for the 2004 and 2005 tax years.

Prior to the adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, the Company
assessed potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”. Quarterly, the Company reviews any potentially unfavorable tax outcome and when an unfavorable outcome
was identified as probable and could be reasonably estimated, the Company then established a tax reserve for such possible unfavorable outcome. Estimating potential tax outcomes for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental and may not be
indicative of the ultimate settlement with the tax authorities. The Company believes that it has adequately provided reasonable reserves for reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters.

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 which effectively amended SFAS No. 5 with respect to income taxes.
Accordingly, the Company’s income tax recognition policy related to uncertain income tax positions is no longer covered by SFAS No. 5. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Company recognized a total liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $45.4 million, $2 million of which was accounted for as an increase to
the January 1, 2007 balance of accumulated deficit as a cumulative effect adjustment. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $14.2 million and $10 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefit would, if recognized, impact the
effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (amounts in thousands):

During 2007, the IRS initiated an examination of the Company’s 2004 and 2005 tax returns. The
Company does not anticipate resolution of the federal examinations during the next 12 months. The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits include certain income tax accounting methods. These accounting methods govern the timing of income tax
deductions. As a result the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits could increase by a range of $0 to $25 million over the next 12 months.

If incurred, the Company would recognize penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized no interest or
penalties.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $30.5 million and $58.4 million, respectively, of FIN 48 liabilities
related to U.S. and foreign uncertain tax positions that increase the NOL and foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax assets are classified as reductions of the NOL and foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax assets in the net deferred tax
asset and liability table above. During 2008, $56.4 million of uncertain tax positions previously netted against the domestic NOL deferred tax asset were reclassified to the liability for uncertain positions in connection with the utilization of the
domestic NOL carryforward. Other uncertain tax positions not increasing the NOL and foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax asset have increased the liability for uncertain tax positions.

Encore at Wynn Macau Construction Development.

Construction has commenced on a further expansion of Wynn Macau. Encore at
Wynn Macau is expected to open in 2010, and will add a fully-integrated resort hotel to Wynn Macau with approximately 400 luxury suites and four villas along with restaurants, additional retail space and additional VIP gaming space. On
November 8, 2007, Wynn Macau, S.A. executed a guaranteed maximum price contract for $347.8 million with Leighton Contractors (Asia) Limited, China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited and China Construction Engineering (Macau)
Company Limited, acting together as the general contractor for the construction of the Encore at Wynn Macau. While the project budget is still being finalized, the company expects total costs to be approximately $700 million.

Through December 31, 2008, the Company had incurred approximately $202 million of costs related
to Encore at Wynn Macau.

Land Concession Contract.

Wynn Macau, S.A. has entered into a land concession contract for the Wynn
Macau project site. Under the land concession contract, Wynn Macau, S.A. leases a parcel of approximately 16 acres from the government for an initial term of 25 years, with a right to renew for additional periods with government approval. Wynn
Macau, S.A. has made payments to the Macau government under the land concession contract totaling approximately $36.4 million and is required to make two additional semi-annual payments (including interest) totaling approximately $6.3 million for
total payments of approximately $42.7 million. Wynn Macau, S.A. also paid approximately $18.4 million to an unrelated third party for its relinquishment of rights to a portion of the land. During the term of the land concession contract, Wynn Macau,
S.A. is required to make annual lease payments of up to $400,000.

Cotai Land Agreement.

On August 1, 2008, subsidiaries of
Wynn Resorts, Limited entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party to make a one-time payment in the amount of $50 million in consideration of the unrelated third party’s relinquishment of certain rights with respect to a portion of
approximately 52 acres of land in the Cotai area of Macau. The payment will be made within 15 days after the Government of the Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China publishes the Company’s rights to the land in
the government’s official gazette. The Company has filed an application for the land with the government of Macau and is awaiting final approval.

Aircraft Deposits

The Company has made deposits on three aircraft purchases totaling $19.4 million which are included in
other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2008. The Company was scheduled to take delivery of those aircraft in 2009, 2012 and 2017 with additional payments to be made totaling $142.2 million. On
February 19, 2009, the Company cancelled the agreements to purchase two of these aircraft. The deposit on one of the aircraft is refundable only to the extent the seller is able to find another buyer. Due to the uncertainty as to the
recoverability of this deposit and a $1.5 million nonrefundable deposit on the second aircraft, the Company will write-off $14.9 million of deposits in the first quarter of 2009.

Leases and other arrangements

The Company is the lessor under several retail leases and has entered
into license and distribution agreements for several additional retail outlets. The Company also is a party to joint venture agreements for the operation of one other retail outlet and the Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership at Wynn Las
Vegas.

The Company’s domestic subsidiaries are covered under a self-insured medical plan up to a maximum of $300,000 per year for each insured person. Amounts in excess of these thresholds are covered by the
Company’s insurance programs, subject to customary policy limits. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries are fully-insured.

Employment Agreements

The Company has entered into employment agreements with several executive officers, other members of management and certain key
employees. These agreements, other than Mr. Wynn’s, generally have three- to five-year terms and typically indicate a base salary and often contain provisions for discretionary bonuses. Certain of the executives are also entitled to a
separation payment if terminated without “cause” or upon voluntary termination of employment for “good reason” following a “change of control” (as these terms are defined in the employment contracts).

Litigation

The Company does not have any material
litigation as of December 31, 2008.

In March 2008, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled, in the matter captioned

Sparks Nugget, Inc. vs. The State of Nevada Ex Rel. Department of Taxation

,
that food and non-alcoholic beverages purchased for use in providing complimentary meals to customers and to employees was exempt from sales and use tax. In July 2008, the Court denied the State’s motion for rehearing. Through April 2008, Wynn
Las Vegas has paid use tax on these items and has filed for refunds for the periods from April 2005 to April 2008. The amount subject to these refunds is approximately $5.4 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had not recorded a

“Adjusted Property EBITDA” is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, corporate
expenses, stock-based compensation, contract termination fee, and other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted Property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure
the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its
competitors. The Company also presents Adjusted Property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company’s ability to incur and service debt, make capital

expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded from their EBITDA
calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses, which do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted Property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an
indicator of the Company’s performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted Property
EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. The Company compensates for these limitations by using Adjusted Property EBITDA as only one of
several comparative tools, together with GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such GAAP measurements include operating income, net income, cash flows from operations and cash flow data. The Company has significant
uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDA. Also, Wynn Resorts’ calculation of Adjusted Property
EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Disclosure Controls
and Procedures

. The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management is required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act and in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure.

Management
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2008, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over
financial reporting. This report appears under “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting” on page 62.

(c)

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our fourth fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying condensed
financial statements include only the accounts of Wynn Resorts, Limited (the “Company”). Investments in the Company’s subsidiaries are accounted for under the equity method.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted since this information is included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

2.

Note Payable to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC

On
August 15, 2005, the Company borrowed $80 million from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, to fund a portion of the construction costs for Wynn Macau. Interest was payable semi-annually at 7.5% per annum. Unpaid principal and
interest was due at maturity on August 15, 2012.

The Company repaid this note, including accrued interest, in July 2008. The Company
recorded approximately $3.3 million and $6 million in interest expense related to this note during each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

3.

Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is a
holding company and, as a result, its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its subsidiaries’ ability to provide funds to it. Restrictions imposed by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s (a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company) debt
instruments significantly restrict certain of the Company’s key subsidiaries holding a majority of the consolidated group’s total assets, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, from making dividends or distributions to the Company, subject to
certain exceptions for affiliated overhead expenses as defined in the agreements governing Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s debt instruments, unless certain financial and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. In addition, except for allowing the
cash distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the subconcession right (see Note 14—Cash Distribution, in the Company’s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K), the terms of the loan agreements of Wynn
Resorts (Macau), S.A. and the Wynn Resorts $1 billion term loan facility noted below contain similar restrictions. The Company received a cash dividend of $1.072 billion from Wynn Group Asia in November 2008. The Company received a cash dividend of
$30 million from Wynn Group Asia in November 2006.

4.

Long-term Debt

$1 Billion Term Loan

On June 21, 2007, the Company entered into a $1 billion term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”). Borrowings under
the Term Loan Facility were available in the form of a delayed-draw term loan facility available through December 31, 2007, with the option to increase the facility to $1.25 billion if certain conditions are met. As of December 31, 2007,
the Company had borrowed $1 billion under the Term Loan Facility and no additional amounts are available. The Term Loan Facility was available to fund (a) the Company’s equity repurchase program announced on June 7, 2007 and
(b) up to $350 million for general corporate purposes. Of the $1 billion drawn at December 31, 2007, $500 million was included as restricted cash in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as such amount was only to be used to fund the
Company’s equity repurchases or repay the loans.



On August 1, 2008, the Company amended the $1 billion Wynn Resorts Term Loan. This amendment allowed
Stephen A. Wynn, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to purchase an interest in the debt. On August 1, 2008, Mr. Wynn advised the Company that he purchased $198,250,000 of the face amount of the outstanding debt under
the $1 billion Wynn Term Loan Facility from a third party. On November 13, 2008, the Company further amended the Term Loan Facility to purchase loans outstanding up to $650 million prior to March 31, 2009. On November 26, 2008, the
Company purchased $625 million of loans under the Term Loan Facility at a discounted price of 95.375%, resulting in the retirement of $625 million of principal for a payment of $596.1 million. The loans purchased included the interests held by
Mr. Wynn. In connection with this transaction, the Company recognized a $22.3 million gain on early retirement of debt, net of the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and fees. The remaining $375 million will mature and be payable on
June 21, 2010.

Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facility accrue interest, at the election of the Company, at either the London
Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) or a Base Rate, plus a borrowing margin as described below. Interest on LIBOR loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period in the case of interest periods of one, two or three months, and
every three months in the case of interest periods of nine months or longer. Base Rate loans bear interest at (a) the greater of (i) the rate most recently announced by Deutsche Bank as its “prime rate,” or (ii) the Federal
Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1% per annum; plus (b) a borrowing margin as described below. Interest on Base Rate loans are payable quarterly in arrears. The borrowing margin is 2.25% for LIBOR loans and 1% for Base Rate loans, if Wynn Resorts,
Limited and Wynn Macau’s combined net liquidity is equal to or greater than $400 million and 2.50% for LIBOR loans and 1.25% for Base Rate loans, if such net liquidity is less than $400 million. The Company incurred a fee of 112.5 bps per annum
of the actual daily amount by which the actual Term Loan Facility commitment exceeded the outstanding amount of the Term Loan Facility.

5.

Equity Repurchase Program

On June 6, 2007,
the Board of Directors of Wynn Resorts authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.2 billion which may include purchases of both its common stock and its Debentures. On July 10, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized an increase of
$500 million to the previously announced equity repurchase program bringing the total authorized to $1.7 billion. The repurchase program may include repurchases from time to time through open market purchases or negotiated transactions, depending
upon market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased 10,915,633 shares for a net cost of $940.1 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased 12,804,954 shares of the Company’s
common stock through open market purchases for a net cost of $1.1 billion, at an average cost of $87.42 per share.

6.

Common Stock Secondary Offering

On
November 18, 2008, the Company completed a secondary common stock offering of 8,000,000 shares with net proceeds of $344.3 million.

On October 3, 2007, the Company completed a secondary common stock offering of 4,312,500 shares with net proceeds of $664.1 million.
