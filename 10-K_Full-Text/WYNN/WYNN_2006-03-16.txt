PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

Wynn Resorts, Limited, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen A. Wynn, is a leading developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. We own and operate “Wynn Las Vegas,” a
destination casino resort on the “Strip” in Las Vegas, Nevada, and are constructing and will own and operate “Wynn Macau,” a casino resort development located in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People’s
Republic of China (“Macau”) which is scheduled to open to the public in the third quarter of 2006. We also are developing an expansion of Wynn Las Vegas named “Encore at Wynn Las Vegas”. In addition, we have submitted an
application to the Macau government seeking a land concession for 54 acres of additional land on the Cotai Strip in Macau for future development, and we continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in other
domestic and international markets.

Unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to “Wynn Resorts,” the
“Company,” “we,” “us” or “our,” or similar terms, refer to Wynn Resorts, Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries or, with respect to periods prior to September 24, 2002, to Valvino Lamore, LLC
(“Valvino”) and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the predecessor company of Wynn Resorts.

Wynn Resorts has previously filed
registration statements and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Any document Wynn Resorts files may be inspected, without charge, at the SEC’s public reference room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20549 or at the SEC’s internet site address at http://www.sec.gov. Information related to the operation of the SEC’s public reference room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, through its own
internet address at www.wynnresorts.com, Wynn Resorts provides a hyperlink to a third-party SEC filing website which posts these filings as soon as reasonably practicable, where they can be reviewed without charge.

Wynn Las Vegas

Wynn Las Vegas opened to the public
on April 28, 2005. The resort’s accommodations, amenities and exceptional service have allowed us to attract and retain high quality customers. Wynn Las Vegas offers 2,674 rooms and suites in its 45-story tower, plus 36 fairway villas and
6 private-entry villas for our premium guests. The approximately 111,000 square foot casino features 137 table games, a baccarat salon, private VIP gaming rooms, a poker room, 1,960 slot machines, a race and sports book and a keno lounge. The
resort’s 22 food and beverage outlets feature six fine dining restaurants, including restaurants helmed by award winning chefs. Wynn Las Vegas also offers a nightclub, an ultra-lounge, a spa and salon, a Ferrari and Maserati automobile
dealership, wedding chapels, an 18-hole golf course, approximately 223,000 square feet of meeting space and an approximately 76,000 square foot retail promenade featuring boutiques from Chanel, Christian Dior, Graff, Manolo Blahnik, Jean-Paul
Gaultier and Louis Vuitton. Wynn Las Vegas also has two showrooms. The Wynn Theater features “Le Rêve,” a water-based production by Franco Dragone, who created “O,” “Mystère” and Celine Dion’s “A
New Day...”. The Broadway Theater currently features the Tony Award winning Broadway musical, “Avenue Q.” We believe that the unique experience of Wynn Las Vegas drives the significant visitation experienced since opening. Since
opening, we experienced an overall 92.1% average occupancy and $274 average daily room rate, which compares favorably to the overall 89.2% average occupancy and $103 average daily room rate of the Las Vegas Strip.

Since its opening, we have further enhanced and refined Wynn Las Vegas in response to market demands and customer preferences. In addition, we have
agreed with the producers of “Avenue Q” that the May 28, 2006 performance of the show will be the last at Wynn Las Vegas. We intend to remodel the Broadway Theater and adjacent areas to accommodate “Monty Python’s
Spamalot” winner of the 2005 Tony Award for best musical.


Wynn Macau

We are constructing and will own and operate Wynn Macau, our first destination casino resort in Macau, under a 20-year casino concession agreement granted by the Macau government in June 2002. We are one of only three concessionaires and
two sub-concessionaires currently permitted by the government to operate a casino gaming business in Macau. The government of Macau has expressed its desire to transform Macau into the tourist destination of choice in Asia. The Chinese government
has also gradually relaxed its travel and currency restrictions, allowing mainland Chinese from certain urban centers and economically developed areas to visit Macau without joining a tour group and increasing the amount of renminbi that Chinese
citizens are permitted to bring into Macau. With approximately 100.0 million people within a three hour drive and nearly 1.0 billion people within a three-hour flight from Macau, Wynn Macau is located in what we believe will be one of the
largest and fastest-growing gaming markets in the world.

Wynn Macau is being constructed, and will open, in phases. The first phase of the
project will utilize approximately 11 of a total site area of 16 acres of land and will include 600 hotel rooms and suites, approximately 100,000 square feet of casino gaming space, seven restaurants, approximately 26,000 square feet of retail
space, a spa, a salon, entertainment lounges and meeting facilities. The second phase will include an additional 136,000 square feet of casino space, two restaurants, additional retail space, a theater, and a dramatic front feature attraction. The
second phase will be built on the remaining five acres of the Wynn Macau site and will be integrated into the first phase. The second phase is expected to be completed and open to the public by the third quarter of 2007.

On February 23, 2006, we announced our intention to increase the capacity of the second phase of Wynn Macau by an additional 150 table games. The
second phase will now include 300 table games, increasing the total number of table games in the facility from 350 tables to 500 tables. The second phase casino expansion and certain improvements to our suite product are expected to cost
approximately $70 million, bringing the total budget of Wynn Macau to approximately $1.2 billion. Subject to receipt of all necessary approvals from our lenders, these additional project costs are anticipated to be funded through the existing
financing structure. The second phase (including the additional 150 tables) remains on target to open by the third quarter of 2007.

On
March 4, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with Publishing & Broadcasting, Ltd. (“PBL”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to PBL a subconcession to operate casino games in Macau for a purchase price of
$900.0 million. The transaction is subject to the approval of the Macau government.

Other Development Opportunities

We have submitted an application to the government of Macau for an additional 54 acres of land in the area commonly known as the Cotai Strip and continue
to explore opportunities throughout the world. We continually seek out new opportunities for additional gaming or related businesses, in Las Vegas, other markets in the United States, and worldwide.

Construction and Development

Wynn Las Vegas

Wynn Las Vegas, with the exception of the Broadway Theater, opened on April 28, 2005. The Broadway Theater, presenting
“Avenue Q,” opened in late August 2005. The entire Wynn Las Vegas project was constructed at a total cost of approximately $2.74 billion. This includes the purchase of the land (including the land for Encore) and buildings formerly
comprising the Desert Inn, additional land for employee parking, costs of design and construction, financing fees, interest and other pre-opening costs.

Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, in the ordinary course of our business and in order to increase revenues, we made and continue to make certain enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas. We have


remodeled six of our Fairway Villas,

Corsa Cucina,

the property’s contemporary Italian restaurant,

Tryst,

the nightclub formerly known as

La B

ê

te,

and portions of the high-limit gaming areas. We also intend to remodel the Broadway Theater and adjacent areas to accommodate the Tony Award winning show, “Monty Python’s Spamalot.” As a result, we have
incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures relating to these enhancements and refinements.

Encore at Wynn Las Vegas

As a result of the strong demand for the amenities and services offered by Wynn Las Vegas, the continued strength of the Las Vegas
market, and our desire to maximize the potential of our substantial real estate assets, we intend to develop Encore at Wynn Las Vegas (“Encore”) on approximately 20 acres on the Strip, immediately adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. We have
refined the design of Encore to include a 2,054-room hotel tower fully integrated with Wynn Las Vegas, containing 144 suites and 1,910 guest rooms, as well as an approximately 44,000 square foot casino, additional convention and meeting space, as
well as restaurants, nightclubs, swimming pools, a spa and salon and retail outlets. We expect to commence construction of Encore in the second quarter of 2006 and open Encore to the public by the end of 2008. The project budget for Encore is
approximately $1.74 billion, including approximately $70.0 million to be incurred for construction of a new employee parking garage on our Koval property, a related pedestrian bridge and costs to be incurred in connection with preparing the Broadway
Theater to host “Monty Python’s Spamalot”.

Wynn Macau

In June 2004, we began construction of Wynn Macau. Construction of Wynn Macau is progressing on time and within budget, with the first phase expected to
open to the public in the third quarter of 2006. Superstructure works are complete for the podium and tower. Certain areas in the first phase of the project, namely retail and the information technology data center, have been handed over to
operations. Construction on the second phase is rapidly moving from the foundations to the structure.

As of December 31, 2005, the
Company has incurred approximately $427.2 million of a total project budget of approximately $1.2 billion (including the expansion of the second phase), with approximately $748.4 million to be spent to complete Wynn Macau.

Financing

Wynn Las Vegas and Encore

On December 14, 2004, we completed a series of transactions that lowered our overall cost of borrowing and raised additional funds
to develop Encore. This refinancing consisted of $1.3 billion of 6


/


% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 (the
“First Mortgage Notes”), a $400 million term loan facility (the “Term Loan”) and a $600 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”). Although a final accounting for Wynn Las Vegas is not expected until the second
quarter of 2006, Wynn Las Vegas’ estimated $2.74 billion total project cost has been, and will be, funded from a combination of contributed capital from the original members of Valvino, proceeds from sales of our common stock, proceeds from the
issuance of the 12% Second Mortgage Notes due 2010 (the “Second Mortgage Notes”) (which were discharged in connection with the December 2004 refinancing), proceeds from the issuance of First Mortgage Notes, and a portion of the Term Loan.

The Revolver is available for Wynn Las Vegas’ general corporate purposes and for Encore, and any amounts repaid may be
re-borrowed. In the second quarter of 2005, we borrowed $80.0 million under the Revolver and loaned it to Wynn Macau, S.A. as subordinated debt (the “Macau Subordinated Debt”). Wynn Las Vegas, LLC repaid this amount in the third quarter of
2005. As of December 31, 2005, $10.0 million was outstanding under the Revolver.

Until the budget, plans and specifications for
Encore (the “Encore Budget, Plans and Specs”) are approved, our loan documents permit us to spend up to $100.0 million of financing proceeds on Encore. Through


December 31, 2005, we had spent approximately $40.7 million. We expect that the remaining proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes, together with
availability under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities and cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to pay for expenditures of up to $1.52 billion on the Encore project without incurring additional debt or receiving additional capital
contributions from Wynn Resorts. Project costs exceeding $1.52 billion will be financed from the issuance of up to $100.0 million of additional notes and/or contributions from Wynn Resorts.

On March 15, 2006, we amended our Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities to (a) allow the Company to issue up to $100.0 million of additional First
Mortgage Notes; (b) simplify draw procedures under the Disbursement Agreement; (c) consolidate certain accounts under the Disbursement Agreement; (d) amend and clarify certain of the conditions for the Phase II Approval Date;
(e) extend the outside opening date for Encore and the outside completion date for Encore to June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009, respectively; and (f) permit expenditures of up to $150.0 million on Encore prior to the execution of a
guaranteed maximum price contract.

The final costs of Wynn Las Vegas will be paid from previously funded amounts under the First Mortgage
Notes and the Term Loan and the ongoing costs of Encore will be paid with funds from the following sources and in the following order of priority:

•

First, by using agreed excess cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas and any equity contributions from Wynn Resorts;

•

Second, by using any proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes (including any additional First Mortgage Notes that may be issued in the future), and the proceeds of borrowings under
the Credit Facilities, until exhaustion of the First Mortgage Notes proceeds, with amounts funded 66.67% from notes proceeds and 33.33% from the Credit Facilities;

•

Third, by using proceeds of additional borrowings under the Credit Facilities; and

•

Fourth, by using the funds from the $50.0 million completion guarantee deposit account.

Wynn Macau

Financing for Wynn Macau’s design, development, construction and pre-opening expenses is provided by a combination of cash on hand in the form of
base equity loans totaling $230 million, the Macau Subordinated Debt, and a senior bank facility. On September 14, 2005, we amended the Wynn Macau, S.A. senior bank facility to expand its availability from $397 million to $764 million,
including $729 million of senior term loan facilities, a HK$117 million revolving credit facility (approximately US$15 million), and an additional term loan facility of HK$156 million (approximately US$20 million). As of December 31, 2005, we
have borrowed approximately $78.9 million under the Wynn Macau, S.A. senior bank facility.

In addition to the above financing sources for
Wynn Macau, we have $30.0 million of long-term restricted cash reserved as contingent equity and a $72.0 million contingent debt facility from our lenders. Upon receipt of approval by our secured lenders, this contingent debt facility will be
used to fund construction of the casino expansion and suite upgrade in the second phase of Wynn Macau.

Our Strategy

Capitalize on the “Wynn” Brand.

Steve Wynn is the preeminent designer, developer and operator of destination
casino resorts and, as such, has developed a “brand name” status. Mr. Wynn’s involvement with our casino resorts provides a distinct advantage over other gaming enterprises. We integrate luxurious surroundings, upscale design,
distinctive entertainment and superior amenities, including fine dining and premium retail offerings, to create resorts that appeal to a variety of customers, especially high-end customers. We believe that Wynn Las Vegas sets a new standard of
luxury and elegance for destination casino resorts in Las Vegas. We also believe that Mr. Wynn’s reputation and the new standard of luxury and elegance brought to the industry by Wynn Las Vegas translate to a high level of anticipation for
Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. We intend to extend our “Wynn” brand to other domestic and international opportunities as they arise.


Attract and deliver high-quality service and amenities to high-end gaming
customers.

Wynn Las Vegas was designed and built to attract premium gaming customers. Wynn Las Vegas offers luxurious rooms and suites, high-limit table offerings, VIP gaming salons, exquisite fine dining (including our
AAA rated, 5-Diamond French restaurant,

Alex),

premium retail shopping, distinctive entertainment and an 18-hole golf course. Our hotel and gaming offerings are designed to meet the expectations of high-budget, premium customers, including
our Asian customers. We expect our Asian customer segment to become even more significant upon opening Wynn Macau and intend to capitalize on cross-marketing opportunities between Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau.

Marketing.

We have positioned Wynn Las Vegas as a full-service luxury resort and casino in the leisure, convention and tour
and travel markets. We market Wynn Las Vegas directly to gaming customers using database marketing techniques, as well as using traditional incentives, such as reduced room rates and complimentary meals and suites. We offer high-roller gaming
customers premium suites and special hotel services, and have a guest loyalty program that integrates all gaming, hotel, food, beverage and retail revenue generated by a particular guest and compares it against incurred expenses to determine the
profitability of that guest. Our rewards system offers discounted and complimentary meals, lodging and entertainment for our guests. We also use our integrated database to target specific customers for promotions that might induce them to visit Wynn
Las Vegas.

Mr. Wynn and our marketing team have developed a substantial network of long-standing international and domestic
high-roller and premium customers. Mr. Wynn’s reputation has attracted experienced, high-level international and domestic casino marketing executives to work with the Company. We have marketing executives located in local offices in Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Taiwan, Vancouver and southern California, as well as independent marketing representatives in major U.S. and foreign cities.

We also create general market awareness for our properties through conventions and media, including television, radio, newspapers, magazines, the Internet, direct mail and billboards.

Capitalize on our Opportunity in Macau.

There are three gaming concessionaires and two sub-concessionaires currently
permitted by the government of Macau to operate casinos. The government of Macau is encouraging significant investment in new and expanded casino entertainment facilities in Macau to enhance its reputation as a casino resort destination and to
attract additional tourists and lengthen stays. We expect tourism in Macau to continue to grow as the Chinese government liberalizes historical restrictions on travel and currency movements. Gaming customers from Hong Kong, southeast China, Taiwan
and other locations in Asia can reach Macau in a relatively short period of time, and visitors from more distant locations in Asia can take advantage of short travel times by air to Macau or to Hong Kong. The relatively easy access from major
population centers promotes Macau as a popular gaming destination in Asia. We will utilize our brand and significant experience in Las Vegas by providing a Steve Wynn-designed property on an attractive site located on approximately 16 acres in
Macau’s inner harbor area across from the Hotel Lisboa, Macau’s largest and best-known casino. Furthermore, we have submitted an application seeking a land concession for 54 acres of land for further development in the Cotai Strip area of
Macau. Our concession provides us with the ability to develop an unlimited number of casino resorts or to sell subconcessions, with Macau government approval, which adds significant value to our Macau opportunity.

Future Las Vegas Expansion.

Wynn Las Vegas is located on approximately 55 acres on the famed Las Vegas Strip. Our property
is located between the approximately 3.0 million square feet of convention space operated by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and the expanding Venetian Casino Resort and its adjoining approximately 1.15 million square foot
Sands Expo Center; diagonally across from the Mirage and the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino; directly across from the Fashion Show Mall; and across from new developments expected on the current sites of the New Frontier and the Stardust casino
resorts. Encore is being developed on 20 acres of land adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. We also have an approximately 142-acre parcel of land behind Wynn Las Vegas, which is currently used as a golf course. In addition, we have approximately 18 acres of
land across Sands Avenue currently used for employee parking.


We are developing a long-range master plan for the 142-acre golf course that will include a large
mixed-use hotel, casino entertainment resort complex. The complex may include multiple waterfront hotels built around a lake offering water sports and other entertainment. The complex also may include multiple restaurants, retail offerings and
entertainment venues. We have not yet developed specific plans for such a complex, and there can be no assurance that such plans will be developed. We cannot predict the cost of such a development or whether we will be able to obtain the necessary
financing for the development on suitable terms, if at all. It is not expected that any construction on the golf course land would begin before 2009.

Experienced Management Team.

Mr. Wynn and his team bring significant experience in designing, developing and operating casino resorts. Mr. Wynn and many members of current
senior management team were responsible for the design, development and operation of The Mirage, Treasure Island at The Mirage, and Bellagio. The senior executive team has an average of approximately 25 years of experience in the hotel and gaming
industries. We also have a 77-person design, development and construction subsidiary, the senior management of which has significant experience in all major construction disciplines. Other senior executives joined Mr. Wynn from renowned
hospitality companies including Caesars Entertainment and Starwood.

Opportunities for Future Growth.

We are
continually looking for new opportunities for gaming and related businesses in Las Vegas as well as other domestic and international markets through acquisition, investment or development.

Market and Competition

Las Vegas

Las Vegas is the largest gaming market in the United States and is also one of the fastest growing leisure, lodging and entertainment markets in the
United States. In 2005, the Las Vegas gaming and hotel markets continued their upward trends with, among other things, a 3.2% increase in visitation, a 13.1% increase in Las Vegas Strip gaming revenue, a 1.3% increase in hotel room inventory and a
14.9% increase in average daily room rates, as compared to 2004.

Many properties on the Las Vegas Strip have opened over the past ten
years, including the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino, New York-New York Hotel and Casino, Paris Las Vegas, Aladdin Resort & Casino and The Venetian. In addition, a number of existing properties on the Las Vegas Strip
embarked on expansions during this period, including MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, Luxor Hotel and Casino, Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino and Caesars Palace. As a result, the casino/hotel industry in Las Vegas is highly competitive. Wynn Las
Vegas is located on the Las Vegas Strip and competes with these and other high-quality resorts and hotel casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, those in downtown Las Vegas, as well as a large number of hotels and motels in and near Las Vegas.

Many competing properties, such as the Bellagio, Caesars Palace, Luxor Hotel and Casino, Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino, The Mirage, New
York-New York Hotel and Casino, Paris Las Vegas, Treasure Island at The Mirage, The Venetian and others, have themes and attractions which draw a significant number of visitors and directly compete with our operations. Some of these facilities are
operated by companies that have more than one operating facility and may have greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than we do while targeting the same demographic group. We seek to differentiate Wynn Las Vegas from other
major Las Vegas resorts by concentrating on our fundamental elements of design, atmosphere, personal service and luxury.

Wynn Las Vegas
also competes, to some extent, with other hotel/casino facilities in Nevada and Atlantic City, riverboat gaming facilities in other states, casino facilities on Native American lands and elsewhere in the world, state lotteries, Internet gaming and
other forms of gaming. The continued proliferation of Native American gaming in California could have a negative impact on our operations. The proliferation of gaming activities in other areas could significantly harm our business as well. In
particular, the legalization of casino gaming in or near metropolitan areas, such as New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Boston,


from which we attract customers, could have a substantial negative effect on our business. In addition, new or renovated casinos in Macau or elsewhere in
Asia could draw Asian gaming customers, including high-rollers, away from Las Vegas.

In addition to the existing casinos with which Wynn
Las Vegas currently competes, several new resorts are expected to open on or near the Las Vegas Strip before 2010. The major projects, which have either been announced or are currently under construction include:

•

Palazzo

—Las Vegas Sands’ new development currently under construction adjacent to The Venetian features a 50-floor tower with approximately 3,025 suites,
restaurants owned and operated by well-known restaurateurs and a theater that is expected to host a Broadway show. The resort is expected to open in 2007.

•

Echelon Place

—Boyd Gaming’s $4.0 billion development, which includes four distinctive hotels with a total of 5,300 guest rooms and suites (one developed by Boyd
Gaming and the other three branded Shangri-la, Delano and Mondrian). The development will also include a 140,000 square foot casino, 25 restaurants and bars, pool and garden areas, a 4,000-seat theater and a 1,500-seat theater that will house
smaller shows and touring acts. In addition, Boyd will develop, own, and operate the Las Vegas ExpoCenter at Echelon Place, with 650,000 square feet of exhibition and pre-function space and 175,000 square feet of meeting and conference space. The
project is expected to open in 2010.

•

City Center

—a new development by MGM Mirage, consisting of a 4,000-room casino resort, retail and entertainment facilities, boutique hotels and residential developments
at an estimated cost of $7 billion. The project is expected to open in 2010.

•

The New Frontier—

land located across the Las Vegas Strip from Wynn Las Vegas is expected to be redeveloped to include a 2,771 room hotel, a 104,000 square foot casino,
approximately 255,000 square feet of convention facilities, and several bars, restaurants, lounges, retail, and related areas. The plan also includes a 500 foot high Ferris wheel with 32 passenger capsules, each able to hold up to 25 people. The
timing and budget for the project are still undetermined.

•

The Cosmopolitan

—a $1.5 billion project being developed by Bruce Eichner, will include a 2,700-unit condominium hotel managed by Hyatt Hotels Corp., a 70,000 square foot
casino, retail shops, restaurants, theater, meeting rooms, and a “beach” club. The property will be located south of the Bellagio and is expected to open in 2008.

Macau

Macau, which was a Portuguese
colony for approximately 450 years, was transferred in December 1999 from Portuguese to Chinese political control. Macau is administered as a special administrative region of China. Macau is located approximately 37 miles southwest of, and less than
one hour away via a ferry system from, Hong Kong and has been a casino gaming destination for more than 40 years. Macau consists principally of a small peninsula on mainland China, and two neighboring islands, Taipa and Coloane, connected by
bridges. We believe that Macau is positioned in one of the world’s largest concentrations of potential gaming customers. According to Macau Statistical Information, casinos in Macau generated approximately $5.6 billion in gaming revenue in
2005, a nearly 10% increase over the $5.1 billion generated in 2004. Macau casinos are primarily table game-oriented and include many private VIP rooms, but relatively few slot machines.

Macau’s gaming market is primarily dependent on tourists. According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics,
18.7 million people visited Macau in 2005, an increase of 12% over the 16.7 million visitors of 2004. From 1999 through 2005, less than one-third of visitors traveling to Macau stayed overnight in hotels and guestrooms and, for those who
stayed overnight in hotels and guestrooms, the average length of stay was only one to two nights. We expect the average length of stay to increase as a result of new, upscale hotel resort accommodations in Macau.


Gaming customers traveling to Macau typically come from nearby destinations in Asia including Hong Kong,
mainland China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, over 90% of the tourists who visited Macau in 2004 came from Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan. Macau completed
construction of an international airport in 1995, which accommodates large commercial aircraft and provides direct air service to major cities in Asia, such as Manila, Singapore, Taipei, Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities in China. It
is estimated that approximately 1.0 billion people live within a three-hour flight, and approximately 3.0 billion people within a five-hour flight, from Macau.

The Macau government is encouraging significant foreign and domestic investment in new and expanded casino and entertainment facilities in Macau that are intended to promote Macau as a casino resort destination and
enhance tourism and lengthen stays. In the past, gaming in Macau was permitted as a government-sanctioned monopoly concession awarded to a single concessionaire. However, under the authority of the Chief Executive and the Casino Tender Commission of
Macau, the government of Macau liberalized the gaming industry in 2002 by granting concessions to operate casinos to three concessionaires, who in turn are permitted, subject to the approval of the government of Macau, to grant sub-concessions to
other gaming operators. Two sub-concessions have been granted to date. On March 4, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with Publishing & Broadcasting, Ltd. (“PBL”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to PBL a
subconcession to operate casino games in Macau for a purchase price of $900.0 million. The transaction is subject to the approval of the Macau government.

The three concessionaires and two sub-concessionaires currently operate 17 casinos in Macau. Sociedade de Jogos de Macau (“SJM”) is one of the concessionaires and operates 15 of the 17 casinos. SJM is
controlled by Stanley Ho, who through another entity, controlled the monopoly concession to conduct gaming operations in Macau for more than 40 years. Most of SJM’s casinos are relatively small facilities, which are offered as amenities in
hotels; however, a few are substantial operations enjoying recognition by gaming customers. Three of the largest casinos in Macau are operated by SJM: the Hotel Lisboa, The Greek Mythology Casino (formerly the New Century Casino), and the Jai Alai.
In addition, an affiliate of Mr. Ho owns substantially all of the water ferry services and the helicopter shuttle service that link Macau to Hong Kong.

SJM was obligated under its June 2002 concession agreement with the Macau government to invest at least approximately 4.7 billion patacas (approximately US $587.5 million) in Macau by December 2004. SJM
is currently constructing the Grand Lisboa behind the Hotel Lisboa.

A joint venture of MGM MIRAGE and Pansy Ho Chiu-king (Stanley
Ho’s daughter) is currently constructing a resort on the Macau peninsula adjacent to Wynn Macau. MGM Grand Macau is jointly owned and operated by MGM MIRAGE and Pansy Ho Chiu-king. The project includes approximately 600 rooms, suites and
villas, several restaurants as well as additional entertainment amenities, 345 table games and 1,035 slot machines. The project budget is $1.1 billion and the opening is anticipated to be in the second half of 2007.

Galaxy Casino Company Limited, referred to herein as Galaxy, also was awarded a casino concession in June 2002. Galaxy is a company controlled by Hong
Kong businessman Lui Chi-woo and a group of Hong Kong investors. Galaxy opened the Waldo Hotel/Casino in 2004, which has become a major casino destination, and is currently constructing the Galaxy Star World hotel casino immediately adjacent to the
Wynn Macau site. Las Vegas Sands Corp., the owner and operator of The Venetian casino resort in Las Vegas and a former partner of Galaxy, has entered into a sub-concession agreement with Galaxy which allows it to independently develop and operate
casinos in Macau. In May 2004, Las Vegas Sands Corp. opened the Sands Macao, the first Las Vegas-style casino to open in Macau. Each of Galaxy Waldo and Sands Macao has captured a significant share of the casino gaming market in Macau. Both Galaxy
and Las Vegas Sands Corp. also have announced their intention to build major casino resorts on the Cotai Strip. Galaxy’s casino concession agreement requires Galaxy and its sub-concessionaire collectively to invest at least 8.8 billion
patacas (approximately US $1.1 billion) in Macau by June 2012.


The Sands Macao opened in 2004 and currently offers 438 table games, 921 slot machines and 51 rooms. Las
Vegas Sands is building the Venetian Macao Resort, a 3,000 suite hotel, casino and convention center complex, and 870,000 square feet of retail, dining and entertainment, all with a Venetian-style theme similar to that of their Las Vegas property.
In addition, Las Vegas Sands has proposed a masterplan for over 200 acres on the Cotai Strip that would include: (a) a Four Seasons-branded project with a 400-room luxury hotel, approximately 600 serviced apartment units and 190,000 square feet
of retail and related space, and (b) two additional hotel properties, to be built in multiple phases. The Venetian Macau is expected to cost $2.3 billion and to open in late 2007.

Our subsidiary, Wynn Macau, S.A., was awarded the third casino concession. Wynn Macau will compete with the casinos and casino hotels that are currently
operated, under development and to be developed by the two other casino concessionaires and their respective sub-concessionaires. Wynn Macau, S.A.’s casino concession agreement permits the government to grant additional concessions for the
operation of casinos after April 1, 2009. If the government of Macau awards additional concessions or permits additional sub-concessionaires, Wynn Macau will face increased competition from casino operators in Macau.

A joint venture of Melco, a Hong Kong stock exchange-listed company and PBL, an Australian casino operator are currently developing the Crown Macau and
has announced development of a large resort on the Cotai Strip, named City of Dreams.

Wynn Macau will also face competition from casinos
located in other areas of Asia, such as Genting Highlands Resort, a major gaming and resort destination located outside of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and casinos in Singapore, South Korea and the Philippines, as well as pachinko and pachislot parlors
in Japan. Wynn Macau will encounter competition from other major gaming centers located around the world, such as Australia and Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout Asia. Further, if current efforts to
legalize gaming in Thailand or Penghu, Taiwan are successful or if the reported large-scale new casino entertainment complex proposed in Manila, Philippines is developed, Wynn Macau will face additional regional competition.

Regulation and Licensing

The gaming industry is
highly regulated. Gaming registrations, licenses and approvals, once obtained, can be suspended or revoked for a variety of reasons. We cannot assure you that we will obtain all required registrations, licenses and approvals on a timely basis or at
all, or that, once obtained, the registrations, findings of suitability, licenses and approvals will not be suspended, conditioned, limited or revoked. If we ever are prohibited from operating one of our gaming facilities, we would, to the extent
permitted by law, seek to recover our investment by selling the property affected, but we cannot assure you that we would recover its full value.

Nevada

Introduction

.    The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of
Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations made under the Act, as well as to various local ordinances. Wynn Las Vegas’ operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission,
the Nevada State Gaming Control Board and the Clark County Liquor and Gaming License Board, which we refer to herein collectively as the “Nevada Gaming Authorities.”

Policy Concerns of Gaming Laws.

The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities
are based upon declarations of public policy. These public policy concerns include, among other things:

•

preventing unsavory or unsuitable persons from being directly or indirectly involved with gaming at any time or in any capacity;

•

establishing and maintaining responsible accounting practices and procedures;


•

maintaining effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs, and safeguarding assets and revenue,
providing reliable recordkeeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities;

•

preventing cheating and fraudulent practices; and

•

providing a source of state and local revenue through taxation and licensing fees.

Changes in these laws, regulations and procedures could have significant negative effects on Wynn Las Vegas’ gaming operations and our financial condition and results of operations.

Owner and Operator Licensing Requirements.

Our subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, as the owner and operator of Wynn
Las Vegas, has been approved by the Nevada Gaming Authorities as a limited liability company licensee, referred to as a company licensee, which includes approval to conduct casino gaming operations, including a race book and sports pool and
pari-mutuel wagering. These gaming licenses are not transferable. We cannot assure you that Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will be able to maintain all approvals and licenses from the Nevada Gaming Authorities.

Company Registration Requirements.

Wynn Resorts was found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Commission to own the equity
interests of Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC (“Wynn Resorts Holdings”), a wholly subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, and to be registered by the Nevada Gaming Commission as a publicly traded corporation, referred to as a registered company, for the
purposes of the Nevada Gaming Control Act. Wynn Resorts Holdings was found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Commission to own the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and to be registered by the Nevada Gaming Commission as an intermediary company.
In addition to being licensed, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, as an issuer of the First Mortgage Notes that were registered with the SEC, also qualified as a registered company. Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp., a co-issuer of the First Mortgage Notes, was not
required to be registered or licensed, but may be required to be found suitable as a lender or financing source.

Periodically, we are
required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Gaming Commission and provide any other information that the Nevada Gaming Commission may require. Substantially all of our material loans, leases, sales of securities and
similar financing transactions must be reported to, or approved by, the Nevada Gaming Commission.

Individual Licensing
Requirements.

No person may become a stockholder or member of, or receive any percentage of the profits of, an intermediary company or company licensee without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming
Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to or material involvement with us to determine whether the individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming
licensee. Certain of our officers, directors and key employees have been or may be required to file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and are or may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. All
applications required as of the date of this report have been filed. However, the Nevada Gaming Authorities may require additional applications and may also deny an application for licensing for any reason, which they deem appropriate. A finding of
suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. An applicant for licensing or an applicant for a finding of suitability must pay or must cause
to be paid all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensing, the Nevada Gaming
Authorities have the jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.

If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an
officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the Nevada Gaming Commission may require us to terminate the
employment of any person who


refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability or questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to judicial review in Nevada.

Redemption of Securities Owned By an Unsuitable Person.

Wynn Resorts’ articles of incorporation
provide that, to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by the board of directors, Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock that are owned or controlled by an
unsuitable person or its affiliates. The redemption price will be the amount, if any, required by the gaming authority or, if the gaming authority does not determine the price, the sum deemed by the board of directors to be the fair value of the
securities to be redeemed. If Wynn Resorts determines the redemption price, the redemption price will be capped at the closing price of the shares on the principal national securities exchange on which the shares are listed on the trading day before
the redemption notice is given. If the shares are not listed on a national securities exchange, the redemption price will be capped at the closing sale price of the shares as quoted on The Nasdaq National Market or SmallCap Market, or if the closing
price is not reported, the mean between the bid and asked prices, as quoted by any other generally recognized reporting system. Wynn Resorts’ right of redemption is not exclusive of any other rights that it may have or later acquire under any
agreement, its bylaws or otherwise. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note, or both, as required, and pursuant to the terms established by, the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as Wynn Resorts elects.

Consequences of Violating Gaming Laws.

If the Nevada Gaming Commission decides that we have violated the Nevada Gaming
Control Act or any of its regulations, it could limit, condition, suspend or revoke our registrations and gaming license. In addition, we and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Gaming
Control Act, or of the regulations of the Nevada Gaming Commission, at the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Further, the Nevada Gaming Commission could appoint a supervisor to operate Wynn Las Vegas and, under specified circumstances,
earnings generated during the supervisor’s appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the premises) could be forfeited to the State of Nevada. Limitation, conditioning or suspension of any of our gaming licenses and the appointment
of a supervisor could, and revocation of any gaming license would, have a significant negative effect on our gaming operations.

Requirements for Beneficial Securities Holders.

Regardless of the number of shares held, any beneficial holder of Wynn Resorts’ voting securities may be required to file an application, be
investigated and have that person’s suitability as a beneficial holder of voting securities determined if the Nevada Gaming Commission has reason to believe that the ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the
State of Nevada. If the beneficial holder of the voting securities of Wynn Resorts who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial
information including a list of its beneficial owners. The applicant must pay all costs of the investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any investigation.

The Nevada Gaming Control Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of the voting securities of a registered company to report the acquisition to
the Nevada Gaming Commission. The Nevada Gaming Control Act requires beneficial owners of more than 10% of a registered company’s voting securities to apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a finding of suitability within 30 days after
the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board mails the written notice requiring such filing. Under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor,” as defined in the Nevada Gaming Control Act, which acquires more than 10%, but
not more than 15%, of the registered company’s voting securities may apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a waiver of a finding of suitability if the institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. In
certain circumstances, an institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may hold up to 19% of our voting securities for a limited period of time and maintain the waiver. An institutional investor will not be deemed to hold voting securities for
investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the
board of directors of the registered company, a change


in the corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered company, or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which
the Nevada Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered company’s voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities which are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment
purposes only include:

•

voting on all matters voted on by stockholders or interest holders;

•

making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in its management, policies
or operations; and

•

other activities that the Nevada Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.

The articles of incorporation of Wynn Resorts include provisions intended to help it implement the above restrictions.

Consequences of Being Found Unsuitable.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license
within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Gaming Commission or by the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in
connection with the investigation of its application, may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any person found unsuitable and who holds,
directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of any voting security or debt security of a registered company beyond the period of time as may be prescribed by the Nevada Gaming Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. We will be subject
to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to hold an equity interest or to have any other relationship with us, we:

•

pay that person any dividend or interest upon any voting securities;

•

allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right held by that person relating to Wynn Resorts;

•

pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or

•

fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to relinquish such person’s voting securities including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of the voting
securities for cash at fair market value.

G

aming Laws Relating to Securities Ownership.

The
Nevada Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require the holder of any debt or similar securities of a registered company, to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt or other security of the registered company if
the Nevada Gaming Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. If the Nevada Gaming Commission decides that a person is unsuitable to own the security, then
under the Nevada Gaming Control Act, the registered company can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission, it:

•

pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest or any distribution whatsoever;

•

recognizes any voting right by the unsuitable person in connection with the securities;

•

pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or

•

makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction.

Wynn Resorts is required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada which may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any
securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A


failure to make the disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We are required to render maximum assistance in determining the
identity of the beneficial owner of any of Wynn Resorts’ voting securities. The Nevada Gaming Commission has the power to require the stock certificates of any registered company to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to
the Nevada Gaming Control Act. The certificates representing shares of Wynn Resorts’ common stock note that the shares are subject to a right of redemption and other restrictions set forth in Wynn Resorts’ articles of incorporation and
bylaws and that the shares are, or may become, subject to restrictions imposed by applicable gaming laws.

Approval of Public
Offerings.

We may not make a public offering without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission if the proceeds from the offering are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in
Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes or for similar transactions. On March 24, 2005, the Nevada Gaming Commission granted us and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC prior approval to make public offerings for a period of two
years, subject to certain conditions (the “Shelf Approval”). The Shelf Approval also applies to any affiliated company wholly owned by us which is a publicly traded corporation or would thereby become a publicly traded corporation pursuant
to a public offering. The Shelf Approval may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board. The Shelf Approval does not constitute a
finding, recommendation or approval by any of the Nevada Gaming Authorities as to the accuracy or adequacy of the offering memorandum or the investment merits of the securities. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.

Approval of Changes in Control.

We must obtain prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission with respect to a
change in control through merger; consolidation; stock or asset acquisitions; management or consulting agreements; or any act or conduct by a person by which the person obtains control of us.

Entities seeking to acquire control of a registered company must satisfy the Nevada State Gaming Control Board and Nevada Gaming Commission with respect
to a variety of stringent standards before assuming control of the registered company. The Nevada Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with
the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.

Approval of Defensive Tactics.

The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Nevada
gaming licenses or affecting registered companies that are affiliated with the operations of Nevada gaming licenses may be harmful to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Nevada Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to reduce
the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada’s gaming industry and to further Nevada’s policy to:

•

assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates;

•

preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and

•

promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

Approvals may be required from the Nevada Gaming Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above their current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can
be consummated. The Nevada Gaming Control Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by a registered company’s board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to its stockholders for the purpose of
acquiring control.


Fees and Taxes.

License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending
on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the counties and cities in which the licensed subsidiaries’ respective operations are conducted. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees
and taxes are payable either monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon either:

•

a percentage of the gross revenue received;

•

the number of gaming devices operated; or

•

the number of table games operated.

A live entertainment
tax also is imposed on admission charges and sales of food, beverages and merchandise where live entertainment is furnished.

Foreign
Gaming Investigations.

Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered, or is under common control with those persons (collectively, “licensees”), and who proposes to
become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada, is required to deposit with the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation of the Nevada State
Gaming Control Board of the licensee’s or registrant’s participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease in the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Licensees and registrants are required to
comply with the foreign gaming reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Gaming Control Act. A licensee or registrant is also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Gaming Commission if it:

•

knowingly violates any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation;

•

fails to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;

•

engages in any activity or enters into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects or tends to reflect,
discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada;

•

engages in activities or enters into associations that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees; or

•

employs, contracts with or associates with a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of unsuitability.

Licenses for Conduct of Gaming and Sale of Alcoholic Beverages.

The conduct of gaming
activities and the service and sale of alcoholic beverages at Wynn Las Vegas are subject to licensing, control and regulation by the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board, which has granted Wynn Las Vegas licenses for such purposes. In
addition to approving Wynn Las Vegas, the Clark County Liquor and Gaming License Board has the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of any corporation controlling a gaming license. All licenses are revocable and are not
transferable. The county agency has full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license. Any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a substantial negative impact upon our operations.

Macau

General.

As a casino concessionaire, Wynn Macau, S.A. is subject to the regulatory control of the Government of Macau. The government has adopted Laws and Administrative Regulations governing the operation of
casinos in Macau. Only concessionaires are permitted to operate casinos. To compete for concessions, candidates were required to tender proposals pursuant to procedures prescribing the content and timing of submissions and the evaluation criteria
involved in the selection process. Applicants were evaluated according to suitability criteria, including their financial capacity, business experience and reputation, and the reputation of their affiliates and associates. Applicants were required
to pay the costs of investigation and to


make a deposit against such costs as part of the submission of proposals. The selection process included consultation and negotiation between the applicants
and the Macau government, which selected the applicants that were awarded concessions. Although subconcessions may be awarded subject to the approval of the Macau government, under the current Law and Administrative Regulations, a maximum of three
such concessions can be awarded. Each concessionaire was required to enter into a concession agreement with the Macau government which, together with the Law and Administrative Regulations, forms the framework for the regulation of the activities of
the concessionaire.

Under the Law and Administrative Regulations, concessionaires are subject to suitability requirements relating to
background, associations and reputation, as are stockholders of 5% or more of a concessionaire’s equity securities, officers, directors and key employees. The same requirements apply to any entity engaged by a concessionaire to manage casino
operations. Concessionaires are required to satisfy minimum capitalization requirements, to demonstrate and maintain adequate financial capacity to operate the concession and to submit to continuous monitoring of their casino operations by the Macau
government. Concessionaires also are subject to periodic financial reporting requirements and reporting obligations with respect to, among other things, certain contracts, financing activities and transactions with directors, financiers and key
employees. Transfers or the encumbering of interests in concessionaires must be reported to the Macau government and are ineffective without government approval.

Each concessionaire is required to engage an executive director who must be a permanent resident of Macau and the holder of at least 10% of the capital stock of the concessionaire. The appointment of the executive
director and of any successor is ineffective without the approval of the Macau government. All contracts for the management of a concessionaire’s casino operation also are ineffective without the approval of the Macau government.

Concessionaires are subject to a special gaming tax of 35% of gross gaming revenue, and must also make an annual contribution of up to 5% of gross gaming
revenue (Wynn Macau, S.A. must pay 4% under its concession agreement) for the promotion of public interests, social security, infrastructure and tourism. Concessionaires also are obligated to withhold, subject to partial exemption, a 5% tax from any
commissions paid to junket representatives. A junket representative is a person who, for the purpose of promoting casino gaming activity, arranges customer transportation, accommodations, food and beverage services and entertainment in exchange for
commissions or other compensation from a concessionaire.

Macau law provides that junket representatives must be licensed by the Macau
government in order to do business with and receive compensation from concessionaires. For a license to be obtained, direct and indirect stockholders of 5% or more of a junket representative’s equity securities (where applicable), its directors
and its key employees must be found suitable. Applicants are required to pay the cost of license investigations, and are required to maintain suitability standards during the period of licensure. The term of a junket representative license is one
year, and licenses can be renewed for additional periods upon the submission of renewal applications. Natural person junket representative licensees are subject to a suitability verification process every three years and business entity licensees
are subject to the same requirement every six years.

Under Macau law, licensed junket representatives must identify outside contractors
who assist them in junket activity. Such contractors are subject to disapproval by the Macau government. Changes in the management structure of business entity junket representative licensees must be reported to the Macau government and any transfer
or the encumbering of interests in such licensees is ineffective without prior government approval. To conduct junket activity, junket representative licensees must be registered with one or more concessionaires and must have written contracts with
such concessionaires, copies of which must be submitted to the Macau government.

Macau law further provides that concessionaires are
jointly responsible with their junket representatives for the activities of such representatives and their directors and contractors in the concessionaires’ casinos, and for their compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Concessionaires
must submit annual lists of their junket


representatives for the following year, and must update such lists on a quarterly basis. The Macau government may designate a maximum number of junket
representatives and specify the junket representatives a concessionaire is permitted to engage. Concessionaires are subject to periodic reporting requirements with respect to commissions paid to their junket representatives and are required to
oversee their activities and report instances of unlawful activity.

The government of Macau may assume temporary custody and control over
the operation of a concession in certain circumstances. During any such period, the costs of operations must be borne by the concessionaire. The government of Macau also may redeem a concession starting at an established date after the entering into
effect of a concession. The government of Macau also may terminate a concession for cause, including, without limitation, failure of the concessionaire to fulfill its obligations under law or the concession contract.

Subconcessionaires are subject to the same conditions as the concessionaires including, but not limited to, the evaluation of suitability, financial
capacity, business experience and reputation. As with concessionaires, sub-concessionaires must appoint a permanent resident holding 10% of the capital stock as executive director and must pay to the government of Macau the special gaming tax of 35%
of gross revenue. The transfer or encumbering of an interest in the subconcessionaire is subject to prior approval of Macau.

Concession
Agreement.

The concession agreement between Wynn Macau S.A. and the Macau government requires Wynn Macau, S.A. to construct and operate one or more casino gaming properties in Macau, including, at a minimum, one
full-service casino resort by the end of December 2006, and to invest not less than a total of 4 billion patacas (approximately US$501 million) in Macau-related projects by June 2009. If Wynn Macau, S.A. does not invest 4 billion patacas in Macau
casino projects by June 2009, it is obligated to invest the remaining amount in projects related to its gaming operations in Macau that the Macau government approves, or in projects of public interest designated by the Macau government.

Wynn Macau, S.A. was also obligated to obtain, and did obtain, a 700 million pataca (approximately US$87.7 million) bank guarantee from
Banco National Ultramarino, S.A. (“BNU”) that is effective until March 31, 2007. The amount of this guarantee will be reduced to 300 million patacas (approximately US$37.6 million) for the period from April 1, 2007
until 180 days after the end of the term of the concession agreement. This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures Wynn Macau, S.A.’s performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of
premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform the concession agreement. Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated to promptly, upon demand by BNU, repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. BNU is paid an annual fee by
Wynn Macau, S.A. for the guarantee not to exceed 12,250,000 patacas (approximately US$1.5 million).

The concession agreement requires that
Wynn Macau, S.A. adhere to an agreed-upon construction schedule for the completion of Wynn Macau, but the agreement provides that the deadlines in the construction schedule may be extended with governmental approval. The government of Macau may
suspend Wynn Macau, S.A.’s construction of a casino if it determines that Wynn Macau, S.A. has failed to adequately implement the construction plans or violated the concession agreement or applicable law.

The government of Macau may redeem the concession beginning on June 24, 2017, and in such event Wynn Macau, S.A. will be entitled to fair
compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption.

The government of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession if Wynn Macau, S.A. fails to fulfill its fundamental obligations under the concession
agreement. The concession agreement expressly provides that the government of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession agreement if Wynn Macau, S.A.:

•

conducts unauthorized games or activities that are excluded from its corporate purpose;

•

abandons or suspends gaming operations in Macau for more than seven consecutive days (or more than 14 days in a civil year) without justification;


•

defaults in payment of taxes, premiums, contributions or other required amounts;

•

does not comply with government inspections or supervision;

•

systematically fails to observe its obligations under the concession system;

•

fails to maintain bank guarantees or bonds satisfactory to the government;

•

is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or becomes insolvent;

•

engages in serious fraudulent activity, damaging to the public interest; or

•

repeatedly and seriously violates applicable gaming laws.

If the government of Macau unilaterally rescinds the concession agreement, Wynn Macau, S.A. will be required to compensate the government in accordance with applicable law, and the areas defined as casino under Macau law and all of the
gaming equipment pertaining to the gaming operations of Wynn Macau will be transferred to the government without compensation. In addition, the government of Macau may, in the public interest, unilaterally terminate the concession at any time, in
which case Wynn Macau, S.A. would be entitled to reasonable compensation.

The government of Macau enacted legislation, effective
July 1, 2004, that enables casinos operating in Macau to lawfully extend credit to gaming customers and to enforce gaming debts. We continue to pursue certain favorable determinations relating to Macau’s tax regulations, however, we cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain the desired determinations. The government of Macau is currently considering various proposed changes to its laws and regulations relating to the regulation and control of casino gaming. Such changes could
affect the profitability of contemplated casino operations in Macau. In addition, some of the laws and regulations summarized above have not yet been applied by the government of Macau to an operating concessionaire. Therefore, the effectiveness,
reasonableness and fairness of the regulatory system cannot be fully assessed at this time.

Seasonality

We may experience fluctuations in revenues and cash flows from month to month, however, we do not expect that our business will be unusually impacted by
seasonality.

Employees

As of
February 28, 2006, we have a total of approximately 9,300 employees (including approximately 300 in Macau). Wynn Las Vegas is fully staffed and we are undertaking a major recruiting effort to staff Wynn Macau for its opening in the third
quarter of 2006.

Wynn Las Vegas entered into an agreement with the Culinary and Bartenders Union local pursuant to which the union has
recently been recognized as the exclusive bargaining agent of certain of our employees. As a result of this recognition, Wynn Las Vegas is obligated to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with the union. Certain other unions may seek to
organize the workers at Wynn Las Vegas. Unionization, pressure to unionize or other forms of collective bargaining could increase our labor costs.

As with Wynn Las Vegas, an extensive training and recruiting program will be used to staff Wynn Macau. This program will accelerate in the second quarter of 2006 as the development of Wynn Macau progresses. We expect that Wynn Macau, S.A.
will employ approximately 4,400 employees by the opening of Wynn Macau.

Intellectual Property

Our most important marks are our trademarks and service marks that use the name “WYNN”. Wynn Resorts has filed applications with the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office (“PTO”), to register a variety of the WYNN-


related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. These marks include “WYNN RESORTS,” “WYNN DESIGN AND
DEVELOPMENT,” “WYNN LAS VEGAS,” and “WYNN MACAU.” Some of the applications are based upon ongoing use and others are based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks in the future.

A common element of these marks is the use of the surname, “WYNN.” As a general rule, a surname (or a mark primarily constituting a surname) is
not registerable unless the surname has acquired “secondary meaning.” To date, Wynn Resorts has been successful in demonstrating to the PTO such secondary meaning for the Wynn name in certain of the applications based upon
Mr. Wynn’s prominence as a resort developer, but we cannot assure you that Wynn Resorts will be successful with the other pending applications.

Even if Wynn Resorts is able to obtain registration of the WYNN-related marks, such federal registrations are not completely dispositive of the right to such marks. Third parties who claim prior rights with respect to
similar marks may nonetheless challenge our right to obtain registrations or our use of the marks and seek to overcome the presumptions afforded by such registrations.

On August 6, 2004, we entered into agreements with Mr. Wynn that confirm and clarify our rights to use the “Wynn” name and Mr. Wynn’s persona in connection with our casino resorts. Under
a Surname Rights Agreement, Mr. Wynn has granted us an exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual, worldwide license to use, and to own and register trademarks and service marks incorporating, the “Wynn” name for casino resorts and related
businesses, together with the right to sublicense the name and marks to our affiliates. Under a Rights of Publicity License, Mr. Wynn has granted us the exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right to use his full name, persona and related rights
of publicity for casino resorts and related businesses, together with the ability to sublicense the persona and publicity rights to our affiliates, until October 24, 2017.

Forward-Looking Statements

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a
“safe harbor” for forward-looking statements. Certain information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements that are forward-looking, including, but not limited to, statements relating to our business strategy and
development activities as well as other capital spending, financing sources, the effects of regulation (including gaming and tax regulations), expectations concerning future operations, margins, profitability and competition. Any statements
contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in some cases you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as
“may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “continue” or the
negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Such forward-looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from
those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, conditions precedent to funding under the agreements governing the disbursement of the proceeds of certain of our debt and
equity offerings and borrowings under our credit facilities, competition in the casino/hotel and resort industries, completion of our Wynn Macau casino resort on time and within budget, our intention to fund a substantial portion of the development
and construction costs of Encore with anticipated cash flows generated at Wynn Las Vegas, doing business in foreign locations such as Macau (including the risks associated with Macau’s developing gaming regulatory framework), new development
and construction activities of competitors, our limited operating history, our dependence on Stephen A. Wynn and existing management, our dependence on one property and, later a limited number of properties, for all of our cash flow, leverage and
debt service (including sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates), levels of travel, leisure and casino spending, general domestic or international economic conditions, pending or future legal proceedings, changes in federal or state tax laws
or the administration of such laws, changes in gaming laws or regulations (including the legalization of gaming in certain jurisdictions), applications for licenses and approvals under applicable jurisdictional laws and regulations (including gaming
laws and regulations), the impact that an outbreak of an infectious disease, such as


avian flu, or the impact of a natural disaster, such as the tsunami which struck southeast Asia in December 2004, may have on the travel and leisure
industry, and the consequences of the war in Iraq and other military conflicts in the Middle East and any future security alerts and/or terrorist attacks. Further information on potential factors that could affect our financial condition, results of
operations and business are included in this report and our other filings with the SEC. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based only on information currently available to us. We undertake no obligation
to publicly release any revisions to such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

The following risk factors, among others, could cause our financial
performance to differ significantly from the goals, plans, objectives, intentions and expectations expressed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks and uncertainties or other risks and uncertainties not currently known to
us or not currently considered to be material actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed substantially.

Risks Related to our Substantial Indebtedness

We are highly leveraged and future cash flow may not be sufficient
for us to meet our obligations, and we might have difficulty obtaining more financing.

We have a substantial amount of consolidated
debt in relation to our equity. With the completion of Wynn Las Vegas, as of December 31, 2005, we have total outstanding debt of approximately $2.1 billion. If the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are approved in accordance with our loan
documents, we will be able to incur up to an additional $590.0 million under the credit facilities to fund the construction of Encore. In addition our credit agreement will permit us to incur additional indebtedness in connection with potential
expansion plans under certain circumstances in the future. Lastly, our credit facilities for the development and construction of Wynn Macau will, subject to certain circumstances, allow us to incur up to $672.0 million (as of December 31, 2005)
of additional debt to complete Wynn Macau. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example:

•

if we do not complete construction of each phase of Wynn Macau by the scheduled completion dates, or if we fail to meet our payment obligations or otherwise default under the
agreements governing our indebtedness, the lenders under those agreements will have the right to accelerate the indebtedness and exercise other rights and remedies against us. These rights and remedies include rights to:

•

repossess and foreclose upon the assets that serve as collateral,

•

initiate judicial foreclosure against us,

•

petition a court to appoint a receiver for us or for substantially all of our assets, and

•

if we are insolvent, initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against us, in each case, subject to procedural restraints and limitations applicable to secured creditors generally
and also those imposed by applicable gaming laws, rules and regulations;

•

we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from the Wynn Las Vegas operations to service and amortize our Wynn Las Vegas indebtedness and to pay development costs
of Encore, which will reduce the available cash flow to fund working capital, other capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;

•

we may have a limited ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to withstand competitive pressures, which may affect our financial condition;

•

we may have a limited ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, to fund development and construction costs of Encore, satisfy working capital requirements, or pay for other
capital expenditures, debt service or other obligations;


•

under our credit facilities, rates with respect to a portion of the interest we pay will fluctuate with market rates and, accordingly, our interest expense will increase if market
interest rates increase;

Under the terms of the documents governing our debt facilities, we will be permitted to incur
additional indebtedness, including secured senior and subordinated indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above will be exacerbated.

The agreements governing our debt facilities contain covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.

The agreements governing our debt facilities contain covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and may
impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. The debt facilities impose operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries, including, among other things, limitations on the ability to:

•

pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity;

•

incur additional debt;

•

make investments;

•

create liens on assets to secure debt;

•

enter into transactions with affiliates;

•

issue stock of, or member’s interests in, subsidiaries;

•

enter into sale-leaseback transactions;

•

engage in other businesses;

•

merge or consolidate with another company;

•

transfer and sell assets;

•

issue disqualified stock;

•

create dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; and

•

designate restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries.

The
debt facilities require us to satisfy various financial covenants, which include minimum interest coverage and total debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Future indebtedness or other contracts could contain financial
or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the existing debt facilities.

Our ability to comply with these provisions may
be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions, and other events beyond our control. As a result, we may not be able to comply with these covenants. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the debt facilities,
including failure as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.

If there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect
to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able
to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities.


Our subsidiaries’ indebtedness is secured by a substantial portion of their assets.

Subject to applicable laws, including gaming laws, and certain agreed upon exceptions, our subsidiaries’ debt is secured by liens
on substantially all of the assets of our subsidiaries. In the event of a default by any of our subsidiaries under their financing documents, or if certain of our subsidiaries experience insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the
holders of our subsidiaries’ secured debt instruments would first be entitled to payment from their collateral security, and only then would holders of our subsidiaries’ unsecured debt be entitled to payment from their remaining assets.

Risks Relating to our Business

A downturn in general economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations.

Our business operations are
affected by international, national and local economic conditions. A recession or downturn in the general economy, or in a region constituting a significant source of customers for our property, could result in fewer customers visiting, or spending
less at, our properties, which would adversely affect our revenues.

We have a limited operating history.

Our operations are subject to the significant business, economic, regulatory and competitive uncertainties and contingencies frequently encountered by new
businesses in competitive environments, many of which are beyond our control. Because we have a limited operating history, it may be more difficult for us to prepare for and respond to these types of risks compared to a company with an established
business. If we are not able to manage these risks successfully, it could negatively impact our operations.

We are entirely dependent
on one property for all of our cash flow, which subjects us to greater risks than a gaming company with more operating properties.

We
do not expect to have material assets or operations other than Wynn Las Vegas until the opening of Wynn Macau in the third quarter of 2006. Until that time, we are entirely dependent upon Wynn Las Vegas for all of our cash flow. As a result, we are
subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company with more operating properties. The risks to which we have a greater degree of exposure include the following:

•

local economic and competitive conditions;

•

changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations;

•

natural and other disasters;

•

an increase in the cost of utilities for Wynn Las Vegas as a result of, among other things, power shortages in California or other western states with which Nevada shares a single
regional power grid or a shortage of natural resources such as water;

•

a decline in the number of visitors to Las Vegas; and

•

a decrease in gaming and non-gaming activities at Wynn Las Vegas.

Any of the factors outlined above could negatively affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments with respect to our debt.

Our casino, hotel, convention and other facilities face intense competition.

Competition for Wynn
Las Vegas.

The casino/hotel industry is highly competitive and additional developments are currently underway. Resorts located on or near the Las Vegas Strip compete with other Las Vegas Strip hotels and with other hotel
casinos in Las Vegas on the basis of overall atmosphere, range of


amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment, theme and size. Wynn Las Vegas also competes with a large number of other hotels located in and
near Las Vegas, as well as other resort destinations. Some of our competitors have established gaming operations, are subsidiaries or divisions of large public companies, and may have greater financial and other resources than we do.

Wynn Las Vegas also competes, to some extent, with other hotel/casino facilities in Nevada and in Atlantic City, riverboat gaming facilities in other
states, casino facilities on Native American lands and elsewhere in the world, state lotteries, Internet gaming and other forms of gaming. The continued proliferation of Native American gaming in California could have a negative impact on our
operations. The proliferation of gaming activities in other areas could significantly harm our business as well. In particular, the legalization of casino gaming in or near metropolitan areas, such as New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San
Francisco and Boston, from which we attract customers, could have a substantial negative effect on our business. In addition, new or renovated casinos in Macau or elsewhere in Asia could draw Asian gaming customers, including high-rollers, away from
Wynn Las Vegas.

Competition for Wynn Macau.

The Macau government has granted concessions to operate casinos
to three companies. Two sub-concessions have also been granted and additional subconcessions are expected. The three concessionaires and two sub-concessionaires currently operate 17 casinos in Macau. On March 4, 2006, the Company entered into
an agreement with PBL pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to PBL a subconcession to operate casino games in Macau. The transaction is subject to the approval of the Macau government. PBL, in partnership with Melco, is currently constructing
the Crown Macau on Taipa and has announced the City of Dreams project in Cotai.

SJM, controlled by Stanley Ho, who through another entity
controlled the monopoly concession to conduct gaming operations in Macau for more than 40 years, is one of the concessionaires and operates 15 of the 17 casinos that are currently operating in Macau. SJM is also constructing the Grand Lisboa, a
resort opposite the rear entrance of the Hotel Lisboa, one of the main competitors in Macau gaming. Las Vegas Sands opened the Sands Macao in May 2004 and is currently building the Venetian Macao Resort, an all-suites hotel, casino and convention
center complex, with a Venetian-style theme similar to that of their Las Vegas property. In addition, MGM MIRAGE is building the MGM Grand Macau, a resort on the Macau peninsula adjacent to Wynn Macau, jointly owned and operated by MGM MIRAGE and
Pansy Ho Chiu-king (Stanley Ho’s daughter).

Wynn Macau will face additional competition from ongoing development in Macau and from
casinos located in other areas of Asia, such as Genting Highlands Resort, a major gaming and resort destination located outside of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and casinos to be developed in Singapore, South Korea and the Philippines, as well as pachinko
and pachislot parlors in Japan. Wynn Macau will also encounter competition from other major gaming centers located around the world, such as Australia and Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout Asia. Further,
if current efforts to legalize gaming in Thailand or Penghu, Taiwan are successful or if the reported large-scale new casino entertainment complex proposed in Manila, Philippines is developed, Wynn Macau will face additional regional competition.

Our business relies on high-end, international customers to whom we often extend credit, and we may not be able to collect gaming
receivables from our credit players or credit play may decrease.

General.

A significant portion of our
table game revenue at Wynn Las Vegas is, and at Wynn Macau will be, attributable to the play of a limited number of international customers. The loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these customers could have a substantial
negative effect on our future operating results. A downturn in economic conditions in the countries in which these customers reside could cause a reduction in the frequency of visits by and revenue generated from these customers.

We conduct our gaming activities on a credit as well as a cash basis. This credit is unsecured. Table games players typically are extended more credit
than slot players, and high-stakes players typically are extended more credit than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of


gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular
quarter.

In addition, the collectibility of receivables from international customers could be negatively affected by future business or
economic trends or by significant events in the countries in which these customers reside. We will extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources, in the opinion of management, warrant such an extension.

Wynn Las Vegas.

While gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a
“marker,” and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, other
jurisdictions may determine that direct or indirect enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the United States of foreign debtors may be used
to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to collect the full amount of gaming debts owed to us, even in jurisdictions that
enforce gaming debts. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.

Wynn
Macau.

Although the law in Macau was changed to permit casino operators to extend credit to gaming customers, Wynn Macau may not be able to collect all of its gaming receivables from its credit players. We expect that Wynn
Macau will be able to enforce these obligations only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To the extent that gaming customers of Wynn Macau are expected to be visitors from other jurisdictions, Wynn Macau may not have access to a
forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and Wynn Macau may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts. Wynn
Macau’s inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on its operating results.

Currently, the gaming
tax in Macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue. However, unlike Nevada, the gross gaming revenue calculation in Macau does not include deductions for credit losses. As a result, if we extend credit to our customers in Macau and
are unable to collect on the related receivables from them, we would have to pay taxes on our winnings from these customers even though we were unable to collect on the related receivables from them. If the laws are not changed, our business in
Macau may not be able to realize the full benefits of extending credit to our customers. Although there are proposals to revise the gaming tax laws in Macau, there can be no assurance that the laws will be changed.

We are subject to extensive state and local regulation, and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations, which could
have a negative effect on our business.

General.

The operation of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau is
contingent upon our obtaining and maintaining all regulatory licenses, permits, approvals, registrations, findings of suitability, orders and authorizations. The laws, regulations and ordinances requiring these licenses, permits and other approvals
generally relate to the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations, as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. The scope of the approvals required to open and
operate a facility is extensive. We received all approvals and opened Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005, however, we are subject to ongoing regulation to maintain its operation. We will open Wynn Macau in the third quarter of 2006, however,
failure to obtain or maintain the necessary approvals could prevent or delay the completion or opening of all or part of the facilities.

Wynn Las Vegas.

The Nevada Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require the holder of any securities we issue to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own Wynn Resorts’
securities if it has reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada.


Nevada regulatory authorities have broad powers to request detailed financial and other information, to
limit, condition, suspend or revoke a registration, gaming license or related approval and to approve changes in our operations. Substantial fines or forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming laws or regulations may be levied. The suspension or
revocation of any license which may be granted to us or the levy of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, compliance costs associated with gaming
laws, regulations and licenses are significant. Any change in the laws, regulations or licenses applicable to our business or a violation of any current or future laws or regulations applicable to our business or gaming licenses could require us to
make substantial expenditures or could otherwise negatively affect our gaming operations.

Wynn Resorts’ articles of incorporation
provide that, to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by the board of directors, Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock that are owned or controlled by an
unsuitable person or its affiliates. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note, or both, as required, and pursuant to the terms established by, the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as Wynn Resorts elects.

Wynn Macau.

Wynn Macau’s operations will be subject to unique risks, including risks related to Macau’s
developing regulatory framework. Wynn Macau may need to develop operating procedures which are different from those used in United States casinos. Failure to adapt to the regulatory and gaming environment in Macau could result in the revocation of
Wynn Macau, S.A.’s concession or otherwise negatively affect its operations in Macau. Moreover, we would be subject to the risk that Macau’s gaming regulatory framework will not develop in a way that would permit us as a United States
gaming operator, to conduct operations in Macau in a manner consistent with the way in which we intend, or the Nevada gaming authorities require us, to conduct our operations in the United States. Our subconcession sale is also subject to the
approval of the Macau government.

There are significant risks associated with major construction projects that may prevent completion
of Encore and/or Wynn Macau on schedule and within budget.

Major construction projects of the scope and scale of Encore and Wynn Macau
entail significant risks, including:

•

shortages of materials or skilled labor;

•

unforeseen engineering, environmental and/or geological problems;

•

work stoppages;

•

weather interference;

•

unanticipated cost increases; and

•

unavailability of construction equipment.

Construction,
equipment or staffing problems or difficulties in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits and authorizations from regulatory authorities could increase the total cost, delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the
design and features of Encore and/or Wynn Macau.

We anticipate that only some of the subcontractors engaged for these projects will post
bonds guaranteeing timely completion of a subcontractor’s work and payment for all of that subcontractor’s labor and materials. These bonds may not be adequate to ensure completion of the work.

We have not yet entered into a final agreement with a general contractor or any trade contractors with respect to the construction of Encore. We may not
agree with general or trade contractors on financial and other terms that will meet our forecasted $1.74 billion cost budget and schedule.

Encore and/or Wynn Macau may not commence operations on schedule or that construction costs for these projects will not exceed budgeted amounts. Failure to complete any of these projects on schedule or within budget may have a significant
negative effect on us and on our ability to make payments on our debt.


Simultaneous construction of our Wynn Macau and Encore Projects may stretch management time and
resources and may impact Wynn Las Vegas.

Both the construction of Wynn Macau and the development and preconstruction efforts for Encore
continue. Since there is significant overlap of the development and construction of these projects, members of our senior management are simultaneously involved in planning and developing both of these projects. Constructing Wynn Macau
simultaneously with the planned development and construction of Encore may divert management resources from the construction and/or opening of any one project. Management’s inability to devote sufficient time and attention to any one project
may delay the construction or opening of any, or all of the projects. Any delay caused by such circumstances could have a negative effect on our business and operations.

In addition, although we intend to construct Encore with minimal impact on Wynn Las Vegas, we cannot assure you that the construction will not disrupt the operations of Wynn Las Vegas or that it will be implemented as
planned. Therefore, the construction of Encore may adversely impact the business, operations and revenues of Wynn Las Vegas.

Terrorism
and the uncertainty of military conflicts, as well as other factors affecting discretionary consumer spending, may harm our operating results.

The strength and profitability of our business depends on consumer demand for hotel casino resorts in general and for the type of luxury amenities Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau offer. Changes in consumer preferences or discretionary
consumer spending could harm our business. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, other terrorist activities in the United States and elsewhere, military conflicts in Iraq and in the Middle East, and past outbreaks of infectious disease
have had negative impacts on travel and leisure expenditures, including lodging, gaming and tourism. We cannot predict the extent to which similar events and conditions may continue to affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. An extended
period of reduced discretionary spending and/or disruptions or declines in airline travel and business conventions could significantly harm our operations. In particular, because our business will rely heavily upon high-end customers, particularly
international customers, factors resulting in a decreased propensity to travel internationally could have a negative impact on our operations.

In addition to terrorist activities, military conflicts, the outbreak of infectious diseases such as the avian flu or the impact of a natural disaster such as a tsunami or typhoon, other factors affecting travel and discretionary consumer
spending, including general economic conditions, disposable consumer income, fears of recession and reduced consumer confidence in the economy, may negatively impact our business. Negative changes in factors affecting discretionary spending could
reduce customer demand for the products and services we offer, thus imposing practical limits on pricing and harming our operations.

Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 have substantially affected the availability of insurance coverage for certain types of damages or occurrences. We currently have insurance coverage for occurrences of terrorist acts with
respect to Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau for up to $500.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, of losses that could result from these acts. However, these types of acts could expose us to losses that exceed our coverage and could have a
significant negative impact on our operations.

In addition, insurance premiums have increased on available coverage, and we may not have
sufficient insurance coverage in the event of a catastrophic property or casualty loss. We may also suffer disruption of our business in the event of a terrorist attack or other catastrophic property or casualty loss or be subject to claims by third
parties injured or harmed. While we currently carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in such event. In the event that insurance premiums continue to increase, we
may not be able to maintain the insurance coverages we currently have or otherwise be able to maintain adequate insurance protection.


If a third party successfully challenges our ownership of, or right to use, the Wynn-related service
marks, our business or results of operations could be harmed.

We have filed applications with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (“PTO”), to register a variety of WYNN-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. These marks include “WYNN LAS VEGAS” and “WYNN MACAU.” Some of the applications are
based upon ongoing use and others are based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks in the future.

A common element of these marks is the
use of the surname, “WYNN.” As a general rule, a surname (or a mark primarily constituting a surname) cannot be registered unless the surname has acquired “secondary meaning.” To date, we have been successful in demonstrating to
the PTO such secondary meaning for the Wynn name, in certain of the applications, based upon Mr. Wynn’s prominence as a resort developer, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful with the other pending applications.

Even if we are able to obtain registration of the WYNN-related marks, such federal registrations are not completely dispositive of the right to such
marks. Third parties who claim prior rights with respect to similar marks may nonetheless challenge our right to obtain registrations or our use of the marks and seek to overcome the presumptions afforded by such registrations.

If a third party asserts other forms of intellectual property claims against us, our business or results of operations could be adversely affected.

Historically, trademarks and service marks have been the principal form of intellectual property right of relevance to the gaming
industry. However, due to the increased use of technology in computerized gaming machines and in business operations generally, other forms of intellectual property rights (such as patents and copyrights) are becoming of increased relevance. It is
possible that, in the future, third parties might assert superior intellectual property rights or allege that their intellectual property rights cover some aspect of our operations. The defense of such allegations may result in substantial expenses,
and, if such allegations should be true, may have a material impact on our business.

The loss of Stephen A. Wynn could significantly
harm our business.

Our ability to maintain our competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts and skills of Stephen
A. Wynn, the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and one of the principal stockholders of Wynn Resorts. In 2004, we extended the term of Mr. Wynn’s employment agreement until October 2017. However, we cannot assure you that
Mr. Wynn will remain with us. If we lose the services of Mr. Wynn, or if he is unable to devote sufficient attention to our operations for any other reason, our business may be significantly impaired. In addition, if Mr. Wynn is no
longer either employed by us as Chief Executive Officer or serving as Chairman of the Board, other than as a result of death or disability or other limited circumstances, it would constitute a change of control that would require Wynn Las Vegas to
offer to repay the First Mortgage Notes and would constitute an event of default under its credit facilities and Wynn Macau, S.A.’s credit facilities.

Our two largest stockholders are able to exert significant control over our operations and future direction.

Mr. Wynn and Aruze USA, Inc. each own slightly less than 25% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. Wynn and Aruze USA, Inc., to the extent they vote their shares in a similar manner, virtually are able to control all
matters requiring our stockholders’ approval, including the approval of significant corporate transactions.

In addition,
Mr. Wynn and Aruze USA, Inc., together with Baron Asset Fund, have entered into a stockholders’ agreement. Under the stockholders’ agreement, Mr. Wynn and Aruze USA, Inc., have agreed to vote their shares of our common stock for
a slate of directors, a majority of which will be designated by


Mr. Wynn, of which at least two will be independent directors, and the remaining members of which will be designated by Aruze USA, Inc. As a result of
this voting arrangement, Mr. Wynn, as a practical matter, controls the slate of directors to be elected to our board of directors.

Because we own real property, we are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.

We have incurred costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal
of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. Under these and other environmental requirements we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at our
property. As an owner or operator, we could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination.

These laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the
presence of the contaminants. The liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. The costs of investigation, remediation or
removal of those substances may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use our property.

In connection with the demolition of the existing buildings situated on the 20-acre parcel where we intend to construct Encore, we discovered a small
amount of asbestos which we incurred costs to dispose of appropriately. We may be required to incur costs to remediate other potential environmental hazards or to mitigate environmental risks in the future.

Risks Associated with Wynn Macau

A number
of new casino resort developments underway or planned for the near future will require us to compete for limited labor resources in Macau.

We will need to recruit a substantial number of new employees before Wynn Macau opens and retain them in order to have a successful operation. Wynn Macau will compete with the large number of new casino resort developments currently
underway in Macau and expected in the near future for the limited qualified employees. We may have to seek employees from other countries to adequately staff Wynn Macau. We cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain a sufficient
number of qualified employees for Wynn Macau.

The development costs of Wynn Macau are estimates only, and actual development costs may
be higher than expected.

We expect the total development costs of Wynn Macau to be approximately $1.2 billion, including the budgeted
design and construction costs, cost of the land payments (through opening), capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses and all financing fees. The required cash interest payments and commitment fees on the bank facility which will become due through
the estimated commencement date of operations of Wynn Macau have been included in our estimate of the total development costs.

While we
believe that the overall budget for the development costs of Wynn Macau is reasonable, these development costs are estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected. Although we have certain owners’ contingencies, a $72.0
million contingent debt facility (which, upon receipt of lender consent will be applied to the casino expansion in phase two and certain suite enhancements) and $30.0 million of contingent equity set aside to cover cost overruns, these contingencies
may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of such overruns. If these contingencies are not sufficient to cover these costs, we may not have the funds required to pay the excess costs.


Not all of the construction costs of Wynn Macau are covered by a guaranteed maximum price construction
contract, and we will be responsible for any cost overruns of these excluded items.

We have entered into a guaranteed maximum price
construction contract for the design and construction of Wynn Macau with Leighton Contractors (Asia) Limited, China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited and China Construction Engineering (Macau) Company Limited, acting together as
general contractor (“Leighton/China State”). The contract covers approximately $457.2 million of the budgeted $685.0 million design and construction costs for Wynn Macau. We are responsible for cost overruns with respect to any budgeted
components that are not part of the amended guaranteed maximum price contract.

The amended guaranteed maximum price under the
Leighton/China State construction contract may increase, and we would be responsible for the amount of any increase.

Although we have a
$457.2 million guaranteed maximum price construction contract with Leighton/China State for the construction of Wynn Macau, it provides that the guaranteed maximum price will be appropriately increased, and the deadline for the contractor’s
obligation to complete construction will be appropriately adjusted, on account of scope changes or delays by us and certain other factors, some of which are beyond our control.

If any of these events occurs and the guaranteed maximum price is increased, we may not be able to complete Wynn Macau within the amount budgeted.

The financial resources of our contractor may be insufficient to fund cost overruns or liquidated damages for which it is responsible
under the amended guaranteed maximum price contract.

Under the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations of the guaranteed
maximum price construction contract, Leighton/China State is responsible for all construction costs covered by the construction contract that exceed the approximately $457.2 million guaranteed maximum price contained in the contract. The parent
companies of the contractor have provided a continuing guaranty by which they guarantee the contractor’s full performance under the construction contract until final payment under that contract. We cannot assure you that the contractor or its
parent companies will have sufficient financial resources to fund any cost overruns or liquidated damages for which they are responsible under the guaranteed maximum price contract. Furthermore, neither is contractually obligated to maintain the
financial resources to cover cost overruns. If they do not have the resources to meet their obligations and we are unable to obtain funds from them in a timely manner, we may need to pay these excess costs in order to complete construction of Wynn
Macau.

Wynn Macau may be affected by adverse political and economic conditions.

The success of Wynn Macau will depend on political and economic conditions in Macau. In December 1999, after approximately 450 years of
Portuguese control, Portugal returned Macau to Chinese administration. The People’s Republic of China established Macau as a special administrative region. As a result of this change in control, Macau’s legislative, regulatory, legal,
economic and cultural institutions are in a period of transition. We cannot predict how these systems and cultural institutions will develop, or how developments would affect the business of Wynn Macau.

Wynn Macau’s operations will be subject to significant political, economic and social risks inherent in doing business in an emerging market such as
China. For example, fiscal decline and civil, domestic or international unrest in Macau, China or the surrounding region could significantly harm Wynn Macau’s business, not only by reducing customer demand for casino resorts, but also by
increasing the risk of imposition of taxes and exchange controls or other governmental restrictions that might impede its ability to repatriate funds.


Macau may not have an adequate transportation infrastructure to accommodate the demand from future
development.

Because of additional casino projects which may be developed in the future, the ferry and helicopter services which
provide transportation between Macau and Hong Kong may need to be expanded to accommodate the increased visitation of Macau. If transportation facilities to and from Macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers
visiting Macau, the desirability of Macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results of operations of Wynn Macau, could be negatively impacted.

Extreme weather conditions may have an adverse impact on Wynn Macau.

Macau’s subtropical
climate and location on the South China Sea are subject to extreme weather conditions including typhoons and heavy rainstorms. Unfavorable weather conditions could negatively affect the profitability of Wynn Macau by disrupting our ability to timely
construct the project and by preventing guests from traveling to Macau.

Our investment in Macau may be subject to potential taxation.

Our investment in Macau is owned through a number of wholly owned and partially owned domestic and foreign entities. Although we
believe that transfers to these entities of the assets and stock of the Wynn Macau companies were accomplished on a tax-free basis, there is a risk that the Internal Revenue Service could assert that any appreciation in the transferred assets or
stock was taxable at the time of such transfers.

Currency exchange controls and currency export restrictions could negatively impact
Wynn Macau.

Currency exchange controls and restrictions on the export of currency by certain countries may negatively impact the
success of Wynn Macau. For example, there are currently existing currency exchange controls and restrictions on the export of the renminbi, the currency of China. Restrictions on the export of the renminbi may impede the flow of gaming customers
from China to Macau, inhibit the growth of gaming in Macau and negatively impact Wynn Macau’s gaming operations.

Any violation of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a negative impact on Wynn Macau.

We are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Any determination that we have violated the
FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

The Macau government can terminate our subconcession under
certain circumstances without compensation to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.

The Macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate our concession in the event of our material non-compliance with the basic obligations under the concession and applicable Macau laws. The concession agreement expressly provides
that the government of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession agreement if Wynn Macau, S.A.:

•

conducts unauthorized games or activities that are excluded from its corporate purpose;

•

suspends gaming operations in Macau for more than seven consecutive days without justification;

•

defaults in payment of taxes, premiums, contributions or other required amounts;

•

does not comply with government inspections or supervision;

•

systematically fails to observe its obligations under the concession system;

•

fails to maintain bank guarantees or bonds satisfactory to the government;


•

is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or becomes insolvent;

•

engages in serious fraudulent activity, damaging to the public interest; or

•

repeatedly violates applicable gaming laws.

If the
government of Macau unilaterally rescinds the concession agreement, Wynn Macau, S.A. will be required to compensate the government in accordance with applicable law, and the areas defined as casino space under Macau law and all of the gaming
equipment pertaining to the gaming operations of Wynn Macau will be transferred to the government without compensation. The loss of our concession would prohibit us from conducting gaming operations in Macau, which could have a material adverse
effect on our operations and financial condition.

We will stop generating any revenues from our Macau gaming operations if we cannot
secure an extension of our concession in 2022 or if the Macau government exercises its redemption right in 2017.

Our concession
agreement expires in June 2022. Unless our concession is extended, on that date, all of our casino operations and related equipment in Macau will be automatically transferred to the Macau government without compensation to us and we will cease to
generate any revenues from these operations. Beginning in December 2017, the Macau government may redeem the concession agreement by providing us at least one year prior notice. In the event the Macau government exercises this redemption right, we
are entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew
or extend our concession agreement on terms favorable to us or at all. We also cannot assure you that if our concession is redeemed, the compensation paid will be adequate to compensate us for the loss of future revenues.

The Macau government has the ability to grant additional rights to conduct gaming in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We hold a concession under one of only three gaming concessions and two
sub-concessions authorized by the Macau government to operate casinos in Macau, and the Macau government is precluded from granting any additional gaming concessions until 2009. However, we cannot assure you that the laws will not be changed to
permit the Macau government to grant additional gaming concessions before 2009. MGM Mirage’s joint venture has obtained a subconcession under SJM’s existing concession. If the Macau government were to allow additional competitors to
operate in Macau through the grant of additional concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Certain Nevada gaming laws would apply to Wynn Macau’s planned gaming activities and associations.

Certain Nevada gaming laws also apply to gaming activities and associations in jurisdictions outside the State of Nevada. As we develop Wynn Macau, we and
our subsidiaries that must be licensed to conduct gaming operations in Nevada will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements concerning gaming activities and associations in Macau proposed to be conducted by our Macau-related
subsidiaries. We and our licensed Nevada subsidiaries also will be subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Gaming Commission if our Macau-related subsidiaries:

•

knowingly violate any Macau laws relating to their Macau gaming operations;

•

fail to conduct Wynn Macau’s operations in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;

•

engage in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable for us because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects or tends to
reflect discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to Nevada gaming policies;


•

engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the State of Nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees; or

•

employ, contract with or associate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of
unsuitability, or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling.

Such disciplinary action could include suspension,
conditioning, limitation or revocation of the registration, licenses or approvals held by us and our licensed Nevada subsidiaries, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, and the imposition of substantial fines.

In addition, if the Nevada State Gaming Control Board determines that any actual or intended activities or associations of our Macau-related subsidiaries
may be prohibited pursuant to one or more of the standards described above, the Nevada State Gaming Control Board can require us and our licensed Nevada subsidiaries to file an application with the Nevada Gaming Commission for a finding of
suitability of the activity or association. If the Nevada Gaming Commission finds that the activity or association in Macau is unsuitable or prohibited, our Macau-related subsidiaries will either be required to terminate the activity or association,
or will be prohibited from undertaking the activity or association. Consequently, should the Nevada Gaming Commission find that our Macau-related subsidiaries’ gaming activities or associations in Macau are unsuitable, those subsidiaries may be
prohibited from undertaking their planned gaming activities or associations in Macau, or be required to divest their investment in Macau, possibly on unfavorable terms.

Unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates may increase Wynn Macau’s obligations under the concession agreement and cause fluctuations in the value of our investment in Macau.

The currency delineated in Wynn Macau’s concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a
freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively
stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese
governmental policies and international economic and political developments.

Certain Asian countries have publicly asserted their desire
to eliminate the linkage of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar, and the Macau pataca will continue to be linked to the U.S. dollar, which may result in severe fluctuations in the
exchange rate for these currencies. We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level.

Because many of Wynn Macau’s payment and expenditure obligations are in Macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable Macau pataca or Hong Kong dollar
rate changes, Wynn Macau’s obligations, as denominated in U.S. dollars, would increase. In addition, because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that Wynn Macau operates in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars, we are subject to
foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. Also, if any of our Macau-related entities incur U.S. dollar-denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the
Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on Wynn Macau’s ability to service its debt, its results of operations and its financial condition.

The sale of our subconcession is subject to the approval of the Macau government.

Risks Associated with the Development of Encore

There are conditions precedent to the
funding of the remaining components of the financing for Encore.

As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $175.4 million in
remaining net proceeds from the offering of our First Mortgage Notes held in a notes proceeds account, and availability under our credit facilities,


which we intend to use to fund construction of Encore. We expect that the remaining proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes, together with availability under
the credit facilities and cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to fund Encore project costs of up to $1.52 billion without incurring additional debt or receiving additional capital contributions from Wynn Resorts.

We have entered into a disbursement agreement with the agent under the credit facilities and the trustee under the indenture for the First Mortgage
Notes, which sets forth the sequence of funding and establishes conditions for the disbursement of funds for the Wynn Las Vegas and Encore projects. Our ability to borrow, from time to time, under the credit facilities and receive advances from the
notes proceeds account is subject to various conditions precedent set forth in the disbursement agreement.

We cannot assure you that we
will be able to satisfy the conditions to funding at the time drawdowns are required to make payments of our construction costs. Satisfaction of various conditions is subject to the discretion of the disbursement agent and the lenders under the
credit facilities and/or their consultants and agent and may therefore be beyond our control. Failure to satisfy the conditions to the drawdowns under the credit facilities could impact our ability to develop and construct Encore. We may not have
access to alternative sources of funds necessary to develop and construct Encore on satisfactory terms or at all.

Availability under
our credit facilities will be reduced by $550.0 million if the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are not approved by March 31, 2006.

Our credit facilities provide that a majority of the arrangers or a majority of the lenders under the credit facilities must approve the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs on or before March 31, 2006. If the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs
are not approved by such date, availability under the new credit facilities will be reduced by $550.0 million. We will submit required documentation to our lenders on March 15, 2006, and will seek necessary consents and approvals from our
lenders. We cannot assure you that the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs will be satisfactory to the arrangers or lenders under our credit facilities. Such decisions are subject to lender discretion and are beyond our control. If we do not have this
availability under the credit facilities or are unable to obtain the required consents, we may not have access to alternative sources of funds necessary to develop and construct Encore on satisfactory terms or at all.

We intend to fund a substantial portion of the development costs of Encore and our substantial debt service and other obligations with cash flows
generated at Wynn Las Vegas, which may not be sufficient to fund such development costs and debt service obligations.

Our ability to
fund a substantial portion of the development costs of Encore, and to make interest payments under the credit facilities, the notes and any other indebtedness, is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations at Wynn
Las Vegas. We cannot assure you that Wynn Las Vegas will continue to be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund such development costs and make the interest payments under the new credit facilities, the First Mortgage Notes and any other
indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash flow depends on many factors, including:

•

our operating performance;

•

the demand for services that we provide;

•

general economic conditions and economic conditions affecting Nevada or the hotel/casino industry in particular;

•

our ability to hire and retain employees at a reasonable cost;

•

competition; and

•

legislative and regulatory factors affecting our operations and business.


Some of these factors are beyond our control. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flows to fund the
development of Encore or meet our debt service obligations would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the financing documents for our Wynn Macau project contain restrictions on the
distribution to Wynn Resorts of any cash flow generated by the Wynn Macau casino. Thus, any cash flow generated by Wynn Macau may not be available to fund development costs of Encore or service our debt.

ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Las Vegas Land

We currently own approximately 235 acres of land on or near the Las Vegas Strip. Our
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC owns a total of approximately 75 acres of land consisting of approximately 55 acres at the northeast corner of the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Sands Avenue and an additional parcel of
20 acres fronting Las Vegas Boulevard next to the Wynn Las Vegas site on which we will construct Encore. Wynn Golf, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC owns the approximately 142-acre golf course behind Wynn Las Vegas, which is
leased to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. Wynn Sunrise, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, owns approximately 18 acres located across from the Wynn Las Vegas site at Koval Lane and Sands Avenue, which is currently being used for employee
parking.

Las Vegas Water Rights

We
own, subject to proof of beneficial use and approval of the State of Nevada Division of Water Resources, approximately 934 acre-feet of permitted domestic and recreation water rights through our subsidiary, Wynn Golf, LLC, which we currently use to
irrigate the golf course. We also own, subject to proof of beneficial use and approval of the State of Nevada Division of Water Resources, approximately 52 acre-feet of permitted (and some certificated) quasi-municipal water rights through our
subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, which is used to supply the water for the Wynn Las Vegas lake/mountain feature. There are significant cost savings and conservation benefits associated with using water supplied pursuant to our water rights. We
anticipate using our water rights to support future development of the golf course land.

Macau Land Lease

The government of Macau owns most of the land in Macau and, in most cases, private interests in real property located in Macau are obtained only through
long-term leases and other grants of rights to use land from the government. In July 2004, our subsidiary, Wynn Macau, S.A., entered into a land concession contract under which Wynn Macau, S.A. leases from the Macau government an approximately
16-acre parcel of land in downtown Macau’s inner harbor area, opposite the Hotel Lisboa, Macau’s largest and best-known hotel casino. The term of the land concession contract is 25 years, and it may be renewed at our option for
successive periods. Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated to pay, in 10 semiannual installments, a total land concession premium of approximately 319.0 million patacas (approximately US $40 million) plus interest at 5%. Annual rents of
approximately 2.2 million patacas (approximately US $275,000) for the first two years and 3.2 million patacas (approximately US $395,000) thereafter will also be paid in accordance with the land concession contract. In addition, Wynn
Macau, S.A. paid a third party affiliated with Stanley Ho approximately 144.2 million patacas (approximately US $18 million) for relinquishing its rights to use a portion of that site.


ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are occasionally party to lawsuits. As with all litigation, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of such matters and we note that litigation
inherently involves significant costs. We are not currently party to any material legal proceedings.

ITEM 4.    SUBMISSION OF
MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

There were no matters submitted to a vote of our security holders during the fourth quarter of
2005.


PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Market Information

Our common stock trades on the
NASDAQ exchange under the symbol “WYNN.” The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices for the indicated periods, as reported by the NASDAQ National Market Securities.

Holders

There were approximately 36,678 beneficial holders of our common stock as of February 28, 2006.

Dividends

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on any shares of our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and
any future consolidated earnings to fund the development and growth of our business and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends.

Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its subsidiaries’ ability to provide funds to it. Restrictions imposed by Wynn Resorts subsidiaries’ debt instruments significantly
restrict certain key subsidiaries holding a majority of our assets, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. from making dividends or distributions to Wynn Resorts. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are
restricted under the indenture governing the First Mortgage Notes from making certain “restricted payments” as defined in the Indenture. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect
holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments cannot be made unless certain financial and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. In addition, the terms of the other loan agreements of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn
Macau, S.A. contain similar restrictions, provided that the Wynn Macau, S.A. loan agreements permit distribution of the net proceeds of subconcession sales.


ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following reflects the selected consolidated financial data of Wynn Resorts and its subsidiaries or Valvino and its subsidiaries. Amounts for 2004
and 2003 have been restated as more fully described in footnote 17 to the notes to Wynn Resorts’ consolidated financial statements. This data should be read together with Wynn Resorts’ consolidated financial statements and notes thereto,
“Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

[1]

Restricted cash and investments primarily reflects the proceeds of our debt and equity financings that are restricted for the construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau and for
the development of Encore. These proceeds are primarily in relatively short-term government-backed debt securities.

[2]

Includes the current portion of long-term debt amounting to approximately $15.5 million, $718,000, $41,000, $38,000, and $35,000 as of December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, and
2001, respectively. December 31, 2005 and 2004 also includes approximately $9.0 million and $9.5 million, respectively, for the current portion of the required contract premium payments under our land concession contract relating to Wynn Macau.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes
thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and gives effect to the restatement discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

Overview

We are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. Wynn Las Vegas, our first resort in Las
Vegas, Nevada, opened on April 28, 2005. Until the opening of Wynn Las Vegas, we were solely a development stage company.


Wynn Las Vegas

We believe Wynn Las Vegas is the preeminent destination casino resort on the Strip in Las Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas features:

•

An approximately 111,000 square foot casino offering a full range of games, including private baccarat salons, a poker room, and a race and sports book;

•

Luxury hotel accommodations in 2,716 spacious hotel rooms, suites and villas;

•

Casual and fine dining in 18 outlets featuring signature chefs, including the Five Diamond award-winning restaurant, Alex;

•

A Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership;

•

Approximately 76,000 square feet of high-end, brand-name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Brioni, Chanel, Dior, Graff, Louis Vuitton, Jean-Paul Gaultier and
Manolo Blahnik;

•

Recreation and leisure facilities, including an 18-hole golf course, five swimming pools, private cabanas and full service spa and salon; and

•

Showroom, nightclub and lounge entertainment

The resort,
which is located at the intersection of the Las Vegas Strip and Sands Avenue, occupies approximately 217 acres of land fronting the Strip and utilizes approximately 18 additional acres across Sands Avenue for employee parking.

In the 248 days since its opening, Wynn Las Vegas generated Net Revenues of $722.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $212.0 million. Net Revenues are
comprised of $353.7 million in Net Gaming Revenues (49.0% of total net revenues) and $368.3 million of Net Non-Gaming Revenues (51.0% of total net revenues). The quality of the resort’s non-gaming amenities, combined with the goal of providing
guests with an unparalleled total resort experience, has driven a premium in Wynn Las Vegas’ average daily room rates and other non-gaming revenues. Consequently, we believe that revenues from Wynn Las Vegas’ non-gaming activities will
comprise a higher percentage of total revenues than that of many of its competitors.

Since its opening, we have further enhanced and
refined Wynn Las Vegas in response to market demands and customer preferences. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we remodeled six of our Fairway Villas,

Corsa Cucina,

the property’s contemporary Italian restaurant,

Tryst,

the
nightclub formerly known as

La B

ê

te,

and portions of the high-limit gaming areas. Improvements and refinements will continue be made throughout 2006. We have agreed with the producers of “Avenue Q” to end Avenue
Q’s exclusive run at Wynn Las Vegas at the end of May 2006. We intend to remodel the Broadway Theater and adjacent areas to accommodate “Monty Python’s Spamalot” winner of the 2005 Tony Award for best musical. We have not yet
determined the total costs of remodeling the theater and adjacent areas, nor have we determined the opening date for the new production.

Encore at Wynn Las Vegas

As a result of the strong demand for the amenities and services offered by Wynn Las Vegas, the
continued strength of the Las Vegas market, and our desire to maximize the potential of our substantial real estate assets, we intend to develop Encore at Wynn Las Vegas (“Encore”) on approximately 20 acres on the Strip, immediately
adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. We have recently refined the design of Encore to feature a 2,054-room hotel tower fully integrated with Wynn Las Vegas, consisting of 144 suites and 1,910 guest rooms, as well as an approximately 44,000 square foot
casino, additional convention and meeting space, in addition to restaurants, nightclubs, swimming pools, a spa and salon and retail outlets. We expect to commence construction of Encore in the second quarter of 2006 and to open Encore to the public
by the end of 2008. The project budget for Encore is approximately $1.74 billion, including approximately $70.0 million to be incurred for construction of a new employee parking garage on our Koval property, a related pedestrian bridge and costs to
be incurred in connection with preparing the Broadway Theater to host “Monty Python’s Spamalot”.


Wynn Macau

We are constructing and will own and operate Wynn Macau, our first destination casino resort in Macau, under a 20-year casino concession agreement granted by the Macau government in June 2002. We are one of only three
concessionaires and two sub-concessionaires currently permitted by the government to operate a casino gaming business in Macau. The government of Macau has expressed its desire to transform Macau into the tourist destination of choice in Asia. The
Chinese government has also gradually relaxed its travel and currency restrictions, allowing mainland Chinese from certain urban centers and economically developed areas to visit Macau without joining a tour group and increasing the amount of
renminbi that Chinese citizens are permitted to bring into Macau. With approximately 100.0 million people within a three-hour drive and nearly 1.0 billion people within a three-hour flight from Macau, Wynn Macau is located in what we believe
will be one of the largest and fastest-growing gaming markets in the world.

Wynn Macau is being constructed, and will open, in phases. The
first phase of the project will utilize approximately 11 of a total site area of 16 acres of land and includes 600 hotel rooms and suites, approximately 100,000 square feet of casino gaming space, seven restaurants, approximately 26,000 square feet
of retail space, a spa, a salon, entertainment lounges and meeting facilities. The second phase will include an additional 136,000 square feet of casino space, two restaurants, retail, a theater, and a dramatic front feature attraction. The second
phase will be built on the remaining five acres of the Wynn Macau site and will be integrated into the first phase of Wynn Macau. The second phase is expected to be completed and open to the public by the third quarter of 2007.

On February 23, 2006, we announced an increase in the capacity of the second phase by the addition of 150 table games. The second phase will now
include 300 table games increasing the total table count of Wynn Macau from 350 tables to 500 tables. The addition to the casino in the second phase, along with enhancements to certain of our suites, is expected to cost approximately $70.0 million,
bringing the total budget of Wynn Macau to approximately $1.2 billion. Subject to our obtaining all necessary approvals from our secured lenders, the addition to the casino and suite product enhancements will be funded through bank facilities under
the existing financing structure. The second phase, including the additional 150 tables, remains on target to open by the third quarter of 2007.

Future Growth

We have submitted an application for a land concession for an additional 54 acres of land on the Cotai Strip
in Macau for future development. We also continue to evaluate additional domestic and international opportunities as they arise.

Results of Operations

We are currently reliant solely upon the operations of Wynn Las Vegas for our operating cash flow. Prior to opening Wynn Las Vegas, we
had not commenced operations, nor generated any significant revenues. Because we have not operated for a full year, we believe that our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are not indicative of future
results.

We incurred a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $90.8 million, which represents a $113.3 million or 56%
decrease from the net loss of $204.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and a $50.7 million or 127% increase from the net loss incurred for the year ended December 31, 2003. Overall, this reflects the cycle of increasing
pre-opening expenses as Wynn Las Vegas approached opening. We expect that our pre-opening expenses, which were a significant contributor to the net losses incurred for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, will decrease in the near
term. We will no longer incur pre-opening expenses associated with Wynn Las Vegas (excluding Encore). However, pre-opening expenses relating to Wynn Macau will increase as the construction of Wynn Macau progresses and as staffing increases prior to
opening. In addition, pre-opening expenses associated with Encore will increase as development of Encore continues and construction commences.


We monitor our operations and evaluate our earnings by reviewing the assets and operations of Wynn Las
Vegas (including Encore) and Wynn Macau. The following table sets forth our financial results for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, by segment and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net loss (amounts in thousands):

(1)

Wynn Macau is currently in the development stage and therefore has no revenues or Adjusted EBITDA.

(2)

“Adjusted EBITDA” is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses, earnings or
losses from unconsolidated affiliates and other non operating income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a
principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of the operating performance of its segments—Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau—and to compare the operating performance of its
properties with those of its competitors. The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA


because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company’s ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working
capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) financial measures. In order to view the operations of
their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded preopening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses, which do not relate to the management of specific casino
properties from their EBITDA calculations. However, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company’s performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a
measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital
expenditures or the cost of capital. We compensate for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA as only one of several comparative tools, together with the common GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such GAAP
measurements include operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operations and cash flow data. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments and taxes,
which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. Also, Wynn Resorts’ calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The 248 days of operations during the 2005 fiscal year have no comparisons to either 2004 or 2003 as we were solely a development stage company prior to
the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005.

Revenues

Wynn Las Vegas’ net gaming revenues were $353.7 million for the 248 days of operations during the 2005 fiscal year. During that period, the average
table games win percentage (before discounts) was within the expected range of 18% to 22%, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 5% to 6% of handle.

For the 248 days of operations in 2005, Wynn Las Vegas’ gross room revenues were approximately $170.3 million. Average daily rate (“ADR”)
and occupancy for that period were $274 and 92%, respectively, generating revenues per available room (“REVPAR”) of $253. Other non-gaming revenues included food and beverage revenues of approximately $173.7 million, retail revenues of
approximately $51.2 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $41.8 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $32.2 million.

Adjusted EBITDA

Wynn Las Vegas’
Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $212.0 million for the 248 days of operations during 2005. Included in Adjusted EBITDA are direct departmental expenses not present in the corresponding 2004 periods. During 2005, these departmental expenses
included casino expenses of $155.1 million, rooms expenses of $44.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $118.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $80.2 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of
approximately $119.0 million and approximately $16.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. At opening, Wynn Las Vegas employed approximately 9,200 persons to accommodate increased opening needs. Natural staffing attrition
reduced the number of employees at the end of 2005 to approximately 8,900 persons, reflecting a more normalized staffing level. We expect Wynn Las Vegas’ operating margins to improve, as we benefit from the decrease in the number of full-time
equivalent employees required to operate the resort and as a result of efficiencies gained through experience with the Wynn Las Vegas resort.

Pre-opening expenses

Wynn Las Vegas’ pre-opening expenses increased by $26.4 million or 64% in 2005 over the prior
year. Once it opened for business in April 2005, Wynn Las Vegas no longer incurred pre-opening expenses; however, $1.6 million of pre-opening expenses relating to Encore are included in the Wynn Las Vegas segment. There also


was a substantial increase in staffing immediately preceding the opening of Wynn Las Vegas, which contributed to the increased level of pre-opening expenses
in 2005. As the Encore development progresses in 2006, we expect associated pre-opening expenses to increase.

Wynn Macau’s
pre-opening expenses increased by $4.4 million or 28% from 2004 to 2005, due primarily to the increased pre-opening activity commensurate with the progress of the resort’s construction. We expect that Wynn Macau’s pre-opening expenses will
continue to increase in the first three quarters of 2006 as construction and development continue toward opening, similar to the trend experienced with Wynn Las Vegas in 2005.

Corporate and other pre-opening expenses were $9.1 million for 2005. After Wynn Las Vegas opened on April 28, 2005, corporate expenses were charged
to general and administrative expense instead of pre-opening expenses. Consequently, corporate and other pre-opening expenses decreased by $15.2 million or 63% from 2004 to 2005. Corporate staffing did not change significantly immediately before or
after the opening of Wynn Las Vegas; instead, the decrease in corporate expenses is due primarily to having a 117-day pre-opening period in 2005, compared with a 365-day pre-opening period in 2004.

Depreciation and amortization

Wynn
Las Vegas’ depreciation and amortization expense increased by $90.5 million for 2005 compared to 2004, as a result of the opening of Wynn Las Vegas. During the construction of Wynn Las Vegas, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings,
improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once Wynn Las Vegas opened and these assets were placed into service, we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. The depreciation expenses will
continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets. When circumstances require a revision to those estimates of useful
life, we adjust them accordingly.

Wynn Macau’s depreciation and amortization expenses also increased by $4.7 million in 2005 compared
to 2004, due primarily to the amortization of the capitalized intangible assets associated with the Macau casino and land concessions. In September 2004, we purchased the 17.5% minority interest in Wynn Macau held by third parties for 1,333,333
shares of Wynn Resorts common stock. We allocated $42.3 million of the value of the shares to the casino concession, which is charged to amortization expense over the concession’s term through June 2022. We also obtained a land lease concession
during 2004, which we charge to depreciation and amortization over the 25-year term of the lease. Other than these charges to depreciation and amortization, Wynn Macau’s depreciation expenses will remain relatively insignificant until the
resort opens and its assets are placed into service.

Certain assets, primarily a corporate aircraft and certain furniture, fixtures and
equipment of Wynn Resorts and its subsidiaries included in corporate and other, are also depreciated. We purchased the corporate aircraft in 2004 and, thus, 2005 was its first full year of depreciation. In addition, when we opened Wynn Las Vegas, we
began recognizing the depreciation of the furniture, fixtures and equipment in our corporate offices, which are located at Wynn Las Vegas.

Property charges and other

In response to our evaluation of the finished product and in response to the reactions of our
guests, we began to make enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas in the third quarter of 2005. Included in the total $14.3 million for Wynn Las Vegas’ property charges and other for 2005 are approximately $9.4 million of costs relating
to assets retired as a result of the remodel efforts at Wynn Las Vegas, and approximately $3.1 million of expenses relating to the abandonment of improvements made to the temporary offices utilized during part of the construction and development of
the resort. Once we decided to remodel the Broadway Theater to present Spamalot, we also wrote off approximately $1.6 million of costs incurred in 2005 in connection with the preliminary design and development of a third theater originally planned
to house “Monty Python’s Spamalot,”


and later abandoned. There were no comparable Wynn Las Vegas property charges incurred during 2004. Property charges in 2004 instead reflect net losses on
ordinary asset sales, including an aircraft sold in 2004 at a loss of approximately $550,000.

Corporate expenses and other

Corporate expenses reflect costs such as salaries and other general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to Wynn Las
Vegas or Wynn Macau. Prior to opening Wynn Las Vegas, corporate expenses were reported as pre-opening expenses. Consequently, the corporate expenses of approximately $22.0 million in 2005 represent such unallocated expenses incurred in the 248 days
of operations in 2005.

Other non-operating costs and expenses

Interest and other income increased by $26.4 million for 2005 compared to 2004. We seek to manage the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate
borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings supplemented by the use of derivative financial instruments as required or considered necessary. We were required to, and did obtain through interest rate swap arrangements,
interest rate protection for portions of our borrowings under our credit facilities. These interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, as amended (“SFAS 133”).

The financial information shown above reflects approximately $8.1 million of income
resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. The remaining increase of approximately $18.2 million is due primarily to the significant increase in the amount of
average cash balances available and invested from the remaining proceeds of our 6-5/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 (the “First Mortgage Notes”) and borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities that were invested during
2005, compared to 2004.

Interest expense, net, increased by $100.0 million for 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to the significant
decrease in the amount of interest capitalized once Wynn Las Vegas opened, plus the increase in the long-term debt principal resulting from our December 2004 refinancing and credit facility borrowings during 2005.

Also during 2004, we recorded a $122.8 million loss on the early retirement of the majority of the original $370.0 million of 12% Second Mortgage Notes
due 2010 (the “Second Mortgage Notes”). This loss resulted from the write-off of associated deferred financing costs and original issue discount, as well as a 12% redemption premium, on the Second Mortgage Notes. We intend to repurchase
the remaining principal amount of the Second Mortgage Notes totaling approximately $10.1 million on November 1, 2006 (the first available call date), at which time an additional loss will have to be recorded to reflect the redemption premium
and any write-off of remaining financing costs. The necessary amounts to call the Second Mortgage Notes, including interest, have been placed in escrow in anticipation of this event.

Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Our development operations resulted in a net loss for the 2004 fiscal year of approximately $204.2 million, a 409% increase over the net loss of
approximately $40.1 million for the 2003 fiscal year, due to increased development activities (such as increased staffing) and financing activities (such as the loss on early retirement of debt).

Revenues

Our minimal revenues for
the 2004 fiscal year decreased compared to 2003, primarily as a result of the closure of the art gallery and its related retail shop on May 6, 2004.


Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA remained a small comparable loss between 2004 and 2003. Although the revenues from the art gallery were reduced, costs to operate the art gallery were similarly reduced, thus not significantly
affecting the total net results.

Pre-opening expenses

Wynn Las Vegas pre-opening expenses increased by $22.1 million or 117% for 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in pre-opening expenses, which consist primarily of salaries and wages and consulting and legal fees, is
directly attributable to the increase in pre-opening activities, including staffing increases, during 2004 as compared to 2003.

Wynn Macau
pre-opening expenses increased by $7.6 million or 91% for 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in pre-opening expenses directly correlates to the increased pre-opening activities for Wynn Macau as the project progressed during 2004 as compared to
2003.

Corporate and other pre-opening expenses increased by $4.9 million or 25% for 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in corporate
pre-opening expenses directly correlates with the increased pre-opening activities for both Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau as these projects progressed during 2004 as compared to 2003.

Depreciation and amortization

Wynn
Las Vegas’ depreciation and amortization increased by $1.7 million or 79% from 2003 to 2004, primarily as a result of purchasing an aircraft in 2004, for which we then began recognizing depreciation.

Wynn Macau’s depreciation and amortization expenses also increased by $1.7 million from 2003 to 2004, primarily resulting from the amortization of
the Macau gaming concession asset, which increased from 2003 to correspond to the increase in asset value, due to the purchase price allocation following the acquisition of the minority interest previously held by third parties in September of 2004,
and the amortization of the leasehold interest in land acquired as part of the land concession agreement entered into in June 2004.

Corporate and other depreciation and amortization decreased by $2.1 million or 59% from 2003 to 2004, primarily as a result of fully depreciating the remaining assets purchased from the Desert Inn Resort and Casino, including the parking
garage, in June 2003.

Property charges and other

In 2004, we sold our existing aircraft and purchased two other aircraft. The aircraft sale resulted in a loss of approximately $550,000, which is the primary component of the increase in property charges compared to
2003. In addition, incidental operations relating to certain cellular tower rental income, plus the loss from the brief operation of an apartment complex purchased in July 2004 (for the subsequent development of a parking facility across Sands
Avenue from Wynn Las Vegas), produced an additional increase in the property charges for 2004 compared to 2003.

Other non-operating
costs and expenses

Other income (expense), net for 2004, decreased approximately $125.5 million to an expense of approximately $115.4
million from income of approximately $10.1 million for 2003, primarily as a result of losses sustained from the early retirement of debt in both the second and fourth quarters of 2004. On June 14, 2004, we recorded a loss of approximately $25.6
million due to the early retirement of a portion of the Second Mortgage Notes. The loss was attributable to the 112% redemption premium and to write-offs of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. On December 14, 2004, as
part of the refinancing of Wynn Las


Vegas, we recorded an additional loss on the early retirement of debt totaling approximately $97.2 million. This loss reflected the tender price on
approximately $237.4 million of Second Mortgage Notes plus the write-offs of the related unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs.

Also during 2004, there was an approximately $9.1 million decrease in interest income and a $6.3 million decrease in interest expense. Lower interest income was primarily attributable to the decrease in average
amount of cash from the net proceeds from equity and debt financing activity as the funds were used to construct Wynn Las Vegas offset by approximately $1.4 million of interest rate swap fair market value increases, while the interest expense
decreased due to increased capitalization of interest commensurate with the progress on the construction of Wynn Las Vegas.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Cash Flow from Operations

Our operating cash flows are primarily affected by our operating income, interest paid, and non-cash charges included in operating income. During 2003 and 2004, we were solely a development stage company without material operations. During
those periods, net cash used in operations was $21.8 million and $114.8 million, respectively. On April 28, 2005, we opened Wynn Las Vegas and began generating cash from operations. Net cash from operations in 2005 was $48.5 million. Because
2005 did not include a full year of operations and because significant pre-opening expenses were incurred during 2005, we believe that cash flows from operations for 2005 are not indicative of future results.

Capital Resources

At December 31, 2005,
we had approximately $434.3 million of cash and cash equivalents available for use without restriction, including for new development activities, general corporate purposes, enhancements to Wynn Las Vegas, or to support the development and
construction of Wynn Macau and Encore. Of this, approximately $308.0 million is held by Wynn Resorts, Limited, which is not a guarantor of either Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s or Wynn Macau, S.A.’s debt, and therefore is not obligated to apply any
of its funds to either Encore or Wynn Macau.

We require a certain amount of cash on hand for operations. Otherwise we attempt to minimize
the amount of cash held in banks. Accordingly, excess funds are swept from accounts into overnight investments or to repay borrowings under our credit facilities.

At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $442.6 million in restricted cash and investments from the proceeds of our debt and equity financings. Of this amount, approximately $394.8 million is restricted
for the remaining costs of Wynn Las Vegas and the construction, development and pre-opening expenses of Encore, including $80.0 million restricted for the Wynn Las Vegas liquidity reserve and completion guarantee ($30.0 million of which must be
retained for Encore for a completion guarantee if the budget, plans and specifications for Encore (the “Encore Budget, Plans and Specs”) are approved); approximately $31.8 million is restricted for the ongoing development,
construction and pre-opening expenses of Wynn Macau; and approximately $15.0 million is restricted for two semi-annual interest payments on our 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2015 (the “Convertible Debentures”), $7.5
million of which was paid on January 15, 2006, with the remaining $7.5 million due and payable on July 15, 2006. In addition, there is approximately $1.0 million restricted for certain sales tax and other payments. Cash equivalents include
investments in overnight money market funds. Restricted investments are kept in money market funds or relatively short-term, government-backed, marketable debt securities as required by agreements governing the Company’s debt facilities.

Construction and Development

Wynn Las Vegas

Wynn Las Vegas, except for one of its two theaters, opened on April 28, 2005. The total Wynn Las Vegas
project cost (excluding Encore other than the land for Encore) was approximately $2.74 billion. This includes


land acquisition costs, design and construction costs, financing fees, interest and other pre-opening expenses. As of December 31, 2005, approximately
$18.9 million of budgeted project costs and retention amounts remained to be paid in order to close out the project. We expect these final costs to be paid in the second quarter of 2006.

Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, we have made and continue to make certain enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas. As a result, we have
incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures relating to these enhancements and refinements. Under the terms of the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities, we were permitted to make up to $40.0 million of capital expenditures in 2005, of which
we actually expended $37.9 million. In 2006, we will be permitted to make up to $80.0 million of capital expenditures at Wynn Las Vegas. These spending limits are increased to the extent funds are contributed to Wynn Las Vegas by Wynn Resorts.

Encore at Wynn Las Vegas

On March 15, 2006, we submitted the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs to our lenders for approval. We expect to commence construction of Encore in the second quarter of 2006, and open it to the public by the end of 2008.

Wynn Macau

In June 2004, we began
construction of Wynn Macau. Design and construction is progressing on schedule and within budget. Superstructure works are complete for the podium and tower. Certain areas in the first phase of the project, namely retail and the information
technology data center, have been handed over to operations. Final design work on the second phase has largely been completed and construction work on the second phase is rapidly moving from the foundations to the structure.

Construction milestones since groundbreaking include the following:

Phase I

•

All external drainage diversion works have been completed and commissioned and the road has been delivered to local authorities;

•

The foundation pile cap construction and underground drainage are complete;

•

The highrise building superstructure, roof placement and signature swoosh are complete;

•

The parking garage is complete;

•

The lowrise podium superstructure is complete;

•

Interior work continues in the lowrise podium areas such as the casino and ballrooms; and

•

Installation of central plant and equipment, including generators, boilers, chillers and cooling towers, continues.

Phase II (expansion)

•

All external drainage diversion works have been completed and commissioned and the road has been delivered to local authorities;

•

Design is progressing; consultancy agreements have been awarded and interior design concepts are being developed;

•

Piling is complete and pile cap activities are underway;

•

Deep excavation for the front feature has been completed;

•

Basement tunnels and corridors have been completed; and

•

Plans for an expanded casino have been finalized.


The current total project budget for Wynn Macau (including the approximately $70.0 million expansion of
the second phase and suite enhancements) is approximately $1.2 billion, including contingencies, but excluding up to $20.5 million of post-opening land concession payments anticipated to be funded from operating cash flows. Under the amended and
restated construction contract, the general contractor is responsible for both the construction and design of the project (other than certain limited portions to be designed by one of our subsidiaries) based on an existing scope of work and design
specifications for both the first phase and the expansion as provided by us, for a guaranteed maximum price of approximately $457.2 million (including the contractors’ fee and contingency). We expect that the guaranteed maximum price will be
increased by approximately $23.0 million to reflect addition of the casino expansion to the second phase of Wynn Macau.

As of
December 31, 2005, the Company has incurred approximately $427.2 million of a total $1.2 billion project budget. Approximately $748.4 million remains to be spent to complete Wynn Macau.

Financing Activities

Wynn Las Vegas and
Encore

On December 14, 2004, we completed a series of transactions that refinanced Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s debt structure and
provided the additional funds to develop Encore. The closing of the refinancing was the culmination of a series of transactions designed to facilitate the development of Encore, lower our overall cost of borrowing, and achieve an enhanced degree of
financial maturity. In addition, the refinancing provided us with the financial flexibility to continue to develop our real estate assets.

Although a final accounting for Wynn Las Vegas is not expected until the second quarter of 2006, Wynn Las Vegas’ estimated $2.74 billion total project cost has been, and will be, funded from a combination of contributed capital from
the original shareholders of Valvino Lamore, LLC (the predecessor of Wynn Resorts), proceeds from sales of our common stock, proceeds from the issuance of the Second Mortgage Notes (which were discharged in connection with the December 2004
refinancing), proceeds from the issuance of First Mortgage Notes, and a portion of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s $1.0 billion credit facilities (the “Credit Facilities”), which consist of a $400 million term loan facility (the “Term
Loan”) and a $600 million revolving facility (the “Revolver”).

The Revolver is available for Wynn Las Vegas’ general
corporate purposes and for Encore, and any amounts repaid may be re-borrowed. In the second quarter of 2005, we borrowed $80.0 million under the Revolver and loaned it to Wynn Macau, S.A. as subordinated debt. This borrowing was repaid by Wynn Las
Vegas, LLC in the third quarter of 2005. As of December 31, 2005, $10.0 million has been borrowed and remains outstanding under the Revolver.

Borrowings under the Credit Facilities have been and are expected to continue to be, designated by us as Eurodollar Loans. These Eurodollar Loans bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 2.25% for the
Revolver loans and LIBOR plus 2.125%, for the Term Loans. Interest on Eurodollar Loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period in the case of interest periods of one, two or three months, and every three months in the case of
interest periods of six months. After the opening of Encore, the applicable borrowing margins for Eurodollar revolving loans will range from 1.25% to 2.5% per annum depending on Wynn Las Vegas’ leverage ratio. In addition to interest, we
also pay quarterly in arrears, 0.75% per annum on the daily average of unborrowed availability under the Revolver. After the opening of Encore, the annual fee that we will be required to pay for unborrowed availability under the Revolver will
be based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s leverage ratio and will range from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum.

The Credit Facilities are
obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and are guaranteed by each of its subsidiaries (other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC). The obligations and guarantees are secured by: (1) a first priority security interest on a $30.0 million liquidity
reserve account; (2) a $50.0 million completion guarantee deposit account held by Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC; (3) the remaining previously funded proceeds of the


Credit Facilities; (4) a first priority pledge of all member’s interests owned by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC in its subsidiaries (other than Wynn
Completion Guarantor, LLC) and Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC’s 100% member’s interest in Wynn Las Vegas, LLC; (5) first mortgages on all real property constituting Wynn Las Vegas, its golf course and Encore; and (6) a first priority
security interest in substantially all other existing and future assets of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors, excluding a corporate aircraft owned by World Travel, LLC, a subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC.

The obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors under the Credit Facilities rank pari passu in right of payment with their existing and future
senior indebtedness, including indebtedness with respect to the First Mortgage Notes and senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness.

The Revolver will terminate and be payable in full on December 14, 2009, and the Term Loan will mature on December 14, 2011. The amount
available under Credit Facilities will be reduced by $550.0 million if the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are not approved by March 31, 2006. This may result in a reduction of availability under the Revolver, required prepayment of term loans,
or any combination of the two.

Until the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are approved, the availability of notes proceeds and funds under
the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit agreement for this project is limited to $100.0 million, of which we have spent approximately $40.7 million through December 31, 2005. We expect to receive approval of the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs by
March 31, 2006. However, if the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are not approved, the available borrowings under our Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities will be reduced by $550.0 million. We expect that the available remaining proceeds from
the First Mortgage Notes, together with availability under the credit facilities, and cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to pay for expenditures of up to $1.52 billion on the Encore project without incurring additional debt or receiving
additional capital contributions from Wynn Resorts. Project costs exceeding $1.52 billion will be funded by the issuance of up to $100.0 million of additional notes and/or contributions from Wynn Resorts. We expect to open Encore by the end of 2008.

On March 15, 2006, we amended our Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities to (a) allow the Company to issue up to $100.0 million of
additional First Mortgage Notes; (b) simplify draw procedures under the Disbursement Agreement; (c) consolidate certain accounts under the Disbursement Agreement; (d) amend and clarify certain of the conditions for the Phase II
Approval Date; (e) extend the outside opening date for Encore and the outside completion date for Encore to June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009, respectively and (f) permit expenditures of up to $150.0 million on Encore prior to the
execution of a guaranteed maximum price contract.

The final costs of Wynn Las Vegas will be paid from previously funded amounts under the
First Mortgage Notes and the Term Loan and the ongoing costs of Encore will be paid with funds from the following sources and in the following order of priority:

•

First, by using agreed excess cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas and any equity contributions from Wynn Resorts;

•

Second, by using any proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes (including any additional First Mortgage Notes that may be issued in the future), and the proceeds of borrowings under
the Credit Facilities, until exhaustion of the First Mortgage Notes proceeds, with amounts funded 66.67% from notes proceeds and 33.33% from the Credit Facilities;

•

Third, by using proceeds of additional borrowings under the Credit Facilities; and

•

Fourth, by using the funds from the $50.0 million completion guarantee deposit account.

In December 2004, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Credit Facilities. See Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.”


Wynn Macau

Financing for Wynn Macau’s design, development, construction and pre-opening expenses is provided by a combination of cash on hand in the form of base equity loans totaling $230 million, subordinated loan
financing (provided from funds borrowed under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC revolving credit facility) totaling $80 million, and a senior secured credit facility. On September 14, 2005, we amended the Wynn Macau, S.A. senior secured credit facility
to expand its availability from $397 million to $764 million, to currently include $729 million of senior term loan facilities, a HK$117 million revolving credit facility (approximately US$15 million), and an additional term loan facility of HK$156
million (approximately US$20 million). As of December 31, 2005, we have borrowed approximately $78.9 million under the Wynn Macau, S.A. senior secured credit facility.

The term loan facilities mature in September 2011, and the revolving credit facility matures in September 2007. The principal amount of the term loans is
required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing on March 14, 2008. The term loans will bear interest at LIBOR or the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (“HIBOR”) plus a margin of 3.0% until the opening of Wynn Macau
(expected in the third quarter of 2006), at which time the interest rate will reduce to LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 2.75%. The senior bank facility also provides for further reductions in the margin on the term loans if Wynn Macau, S.A.
satisfies certain prescribed leverage ratio tests. Loans under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at HIBOR plus 2.5%.

Collateral for the senior bank facility consists of substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. Certain affiliates that own interests in Wynn Macau, S.A., either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, have executed
guarantees of the loans and pledged their interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. as additional security for repayment of the loans.

We began to
draw under the Senior Secured Facilities in October 2005, after expenditure of the base equity and subordinated funding. Through December 31, 2005, we incurred approximately $427.2 million of the total $1.2 billion of budgeted project
costs. Total budgeted project costs include construction and design costs (including construction contingencies) of approximately $688.0 million, land acquisition costs of approximately $49.0 million, the additional casino expansion of approximately
$70.0 million and capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses, financing fees and other costs totaling in the aggregate approximately $368.6 million. These costs have been, and will continue to be, paid from the previously funded $230.0 million base
equity and loans from Wynn Resorts and $80.0 million borrowed under Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s revolving credit agreement and loaned as subordinated debt, as well as Wynn Macau, S.A.’s $764.0 million senior secured credit facility and cash
flows from operations once Wynn Macau opens. As of December 31, 2005, project costs still to be incurred totaled approximately $748.4 million.

In addition to the above financing sources, we have $30.0 million (plus $1.8 million of accumulated interest earnings) of long-term restricted cash reserved as contingent equity and a $72.0 million contingent
debt facility available for Wynn Macau. We entered into interest rate swap agreements in October 2005 to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Wynn Macau, S.A. credit facilities. See Item 7A.
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Other

In the second quarter of 2005, we borrowed an aggregate amount of $44.75 million secured by a corporate aircraft. The loans mature on May 24, 2010.
Principal and interest is payable quarterly, and interest is calculated at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.375%. In addition to scheduled amortization payments, we are required to prepay the loans if certain events of loss with respect to the aircraft
occur. Beginning December 31, 2006, we may prepay all or any portion of the loans, subject to a minimum prepayment of $10.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $43.5 million was outstanding under this borrowing.

Expected Commercial Commitments

The following
table summarizes certain information regarding our expected long-term indebtedness and material commercial commitments based upon our best estimate at December 31, 2005 of our expected long-term


indebtedness and commercial commitments (amounts in millions):

[1]

Represents the full obligation under the Convertible Debentures assuming no conversion to common stock. The Convertible Debentures are convertible, at the holders’ option, into
a maximum of 10,869,550 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture governing the Convertible Debentures), which is equivalent to a conversion price of $23.00 per share. Subsequent to December 31, 2005 through
the filing of this report, approximately $3.8 million of the Convertible Debentures were converted into common stock.

[2]

As of December 31, 2005, we had $400.0 million of Term Loans outstanding and $10.0 million outstanding under the Revolver, which mature on December 14, 2011 and
December 14, 2009, respectively. The $590.0 million remaining available under the Revolver may be used for working capital for Wynn Las Vegas or, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, for the construction and development of Encore.

[3]

As of December 31, 2005, we had borrowed approximately $79.0 million under Wynn Macau, S.A.’s senior credit facilities. We anticipate that we will borrow the remaining
available amounts to construct and open Wynn Macau and its expansion by the third quarter of 2007. Principal amortization begins in 2007 and the facility matures on September 14, 2011.

[4]

On December 14, 2004, we deposited in trust with the trustee under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture, government securities having an aggregate face value of approximately
$10.1 million (the amounts necessary to pay when due all interest payments and the redemption price on November 1, 2006), and an additional $3.0 million in cash to discharge amounts payable under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture.

[5]

Represents the $43.5 million outstanding of the $44.75 million original term loan borrowing secured by a corporate aircraft bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.375%; $13.3 million
remaining outstanding on a 5.67% note payable pursuant to a loan to finance our other corporate aircraft; and the remaining amount of an 8% annuity issued by ITT Sheraton in connection with the acquisition of a parcel of land in 1994. The $43.5
million aircraft loan requires quarterly amortizing principal and interest payments and matures on May 24, 2010; the $13.3 million aircraft loan notes requires monthly principal and interest payments with balloon payments of $9.6 million in
2011; and the annuity requires payments of $5,000 per month until February 2009.


[6]

In June 2004, we entered into a land concession contract with the government of Macau for a 25-year lease of approximately 16 acres of land. At December 31, 2005, we had 8
semi-annual installment payments remaining at 5% interest, as specified in the land concession contract.

[7]

Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon currently existing commitments and anticipated LIBOR rates based upon
expected yield curves (including the effect of our interest rate swaps) as well as expected timing of repayments.

Other
Liquidity Matters

Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its
subsidiaries’ ability to provide funds to it. Restrictions imposed by our subsidiaries’ debt instruments significantly restrict certain key subsidiaries holding a majority of our assets, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A.,
from making dividends or distributions to us. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture governing the First Mortgage Notes from making certain “restricted payments” as defined in
the Indenture. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial and
non-financial criteria have been satisfied. The other credit facilities of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. contain similar restrictions; provided that the Wynn Macau, S.A. loan agreements permit distribution of the net proceeds of
subconcession sales.

If completion of Encore or Wynn Macau projects is delayed, then our debt service obligations accruing prior to the
actual opening will increase correspondingly. Wynn Las Vegas will fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and remaining availability under Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s credit facilities. We cannot assure you, however,
that Wynn Las Vegas will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings available to us under the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s indebtedness
and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that Wynn Macau, upon opening, will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.’s debt service obligations with operating cash flow and remaining availability under its senior secured bank facility.
However, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows and available borrowings will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of
the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.

New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to
raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in Las Vegas, as well as other domestic or international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with
respect to any other opportunity. Any other development would require us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau-related
entities.

Wynn Resorts’ articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its
common stock, that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by our Board of
Directors. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its
shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and will increase our leverage ratio.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial
statements. Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require that management apply significant judgment in
defining the appropriate assumptions


integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable
assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty rewards, self insurance, contingencies, litigation and other items. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends
and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.

Development, Construction and Property and Equipment Estimates

During the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. In connection with the construction and development of Wynn Las Vegas, significant start-up costs were
incurred and charged to pre-opening expenses through the second quarter of 2005, as anticipated. Once Wynn Las Vegas opened to the public, expenses associated with the opening of the resort were no longer charged as pre-opening expenses. However,
start-up costs relating to the Encore and Wynn Macau projects will continue to be charged to pre-opening expenses.

During the construction
and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment
increase significantly during construction periods. Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are put in service. Accordingly, upon opening of Wynn Las Vegas, we began recognizing
depreciation expense on the resort’s fixed assets. Depreciation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the corresponding assets as follows:

The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed. A charge resulting from
a change in the estimated period of benefit is accounted for in the period of change as a change in accounting estimate under Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) No. 20, “Accounting Changes.”

Our leasehold interest in the land leased in Macau under the land concession contract entered into in June 2004 is being amortized over 25 years, to
reflect the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminates in June 2029. Depreciation on the majority of the assets comprising Wynn Macau, however, will commence in the third quarter of 2006, when Wynn Macau opens. The maximum
useful life of assets at Wynn Macau will be the remaining life of the gaming concession, which currently expires in June 2022. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau will generally be charged on an accelerated basis when compared to Wynn
Las Vegas.

Costs of building repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of
property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income or loss.

We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on
comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an
undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the


undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a
discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as
operating expenses.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and Macau. We account for income taxes according to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS
109”). SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss carry-forwards and certain temporary differences. The standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent
that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.

During our development stage, we
accumulated significant net operating losses which, among other things, generated significant deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2005, we had $199.9 million of deferred tax assets and $99.7 million of deferred tax liabilities. At
this time, because of our limited operating history, we have fully reserved these net deferred tax assets. If these net deferred tax assets become more likely than not realizable as defined by SFAS No. 109, we intend to appropriately reduce the
deferred tax asset reserves.

Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts Receivable

We evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as management’s prior experience with collection trends
in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions.

A substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to
casino credit play. Credit play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at Wynn Las Vegas. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their
marker balances timely. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the
United States. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. At December 31, 2005, approximately 70%
of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries. The collectibility of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the
customers’ home countries.

As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad
debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts charge may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a
certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy or legal system occur.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate
and variable-rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”
as amended. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) as applicable.

Significant Judgmental Accruals

We
estimate liabilities for certain self-insurance, customer loyalty program reward redemptions, contingencies, claims and litigation and other items, as appropriate. Management determines the adequacy of


these estimates by reviewing the expected trends and from industry experience and adjusts the assumptions utilized as necessary.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December
2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R), “Share Based Payment.” This statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for
transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the
issuance of those equity instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service
period. We adopted this statement, according to SEC rule, as amended, on January 1, 2006, utilizing the modified prospective method and the Black-Scholes valuation model.

In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulleting (“SAB”) No. 107, “Share-Based Payment “ to provide interpretive
guidance on SFAS No. 123(R) valuation methods, assumptions used in valuation models, and the interaction of SFAS No. 123(R) with existing SEC guidance. SAB No. 107 also requires the classification of stock compensation expense in the
same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and will therefore impact our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and
administrative expenses (including corporate expenses). We estimate that the expensing of stock options will reduce our net income for 2006 by approximately $12.8 million (or $0.13 per share) for the unvested options outstanding as of
December 31, 2005.

See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements, for a description of
other recently issued accounting pronouncements, which are relevant to the Company but which we believe will not have a material impact on the Company.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk of
loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.

Interest
Rate Risks

Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on
floating rates. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financing Activities.” We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing
the mix of long-term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate
fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations.


The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of
repayments at December 31, 2005 on our expected long-term indebtedness. However, we cannot predict the LIBOR or HIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future. Accordingly, the LIBOR and HIBOR rates at December 31, 2005 of 4.37875% and
4.11045%, respectively are used for all calculations in the table below.

Interest Rate Swap Information

In 2003, 2004 and 2005, the Company entered into interest rate swap arrangements relating to certain of its floating-rate debt facilities, and accounts
for these swaps under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (“SFAS No. 133”), and its related interpretations.

Wynn Las Vegas swaps

During 2003, we
entered into two interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $825.0 million of borrowings under our previous Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities. On December 14, 2004, concurrent with the
refinancing of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s debt structure, we terminated these two interest rate swaps. As a result of the termination, we received a cash payment of approximately $9.6 million in settlement of the related asset.

Concurrent with the refinancing, we entered into two new interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $400.0
million of borrowings under the current Wynn Las Vegas, LLC term loan facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.125%. Under each of these two interest rate swap arrangements, we receive payments at a variable rate of LIBOR and pay a fixed rate
of 3.793% on $200 million notional amount set forth in the swap instruments from February and March 2005, respectively through December 2008. Although these interest rate swaps are highly effective economically in fixing the interest rate on these
borrowings under the new term loan facility at approximately 5.9%, changes in fair value of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period are, and will continue to be, recorded as a component of interest and other income as the swaps do not
qualify for hedge accounting.

Wynn Macau

On October 14, 2005, we entered into two interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on future borrowings under Wynn Macau S.A.’s $749 million senior term loan facility. Under
the first swap agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 4.84% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately $198.2 million, in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable
interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. Under the second swap agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 4.77% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately
HK$1.1 billion (approximately US$140.3 million), in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. The term of both swap agreements is from November 28, 2005 through
November 28, 2008.

These interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective in fixing the interest rate on 50% of the US dollar
and 50% of the Hong Kong dollar borrowings under the senior bank facility at approximately 7.84% and


7.77%, respectively. However, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period recorded are, and will continue to be,
recognized as a component of interest and other income as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Summary of Historical Fair
Values

The following table presents the historical asset or (liability) fair values (reflected in deposits and other assets or in other
long-term liabilities as appropriate) at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 and as of the December 14, 2004 termination date of the previous Wynn Las Vegas interest rate swaps (amounts in thousands):

The fair value approximates the amount the Company would receive if these contracts were settled
at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to
significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods.

Other Interest Rate Swap Information

The following table provides information about our interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2005 and using estimated future LIBOR
and HIBOR rates based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve:

We do not use derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative
commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we incurred approximately $149.5 million in interest. Certain amounts of our outstanding indebtedness for the
year was based upon a variable, LIBOR rate plus a premium. A 1% increase in the LIBOR would have increased our interest cost for 2005 by approximately $700,000.

Foreign Currency Risks

The currency delineated in Wynn Macau’s concession agreement with the
government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar
and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years.


However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes
due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments.

In July 2005,
officials from the People’s Bank of China announced the adoption of a new foreign exchange policy that will move away from a U.S. dollar peg of 8.28 Chinese renminbi to one U.S. dollar. The renminbi will instead trade based on a basket of
currencies. The currency components of the basket have not been announced. The exchange rate at September 30, 2005, was 8.11 Chinese renminbi to one U.S. dollar. Management believes that the current revaluation of the renminibi will not have a
material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Certain Asian countries have publicly asserted their desire to
eliminate the linkage of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar, and the Macau pataca will continue to be linked to the U.S. dollar, which may result in severe fluctuations in the
exchange rate for these currencies. We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level.

Because many of Wynn Macau’s payment and expenditure obligations are in Macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable Macau pataca or Hong Kong dollar
rate changes, Wynn Macau’s obligations, as denominated in U.S. dollars, would increase. In addition, because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that Wynn Macau operates in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars, we are subject to
foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. Also, if any of our Macau-related entities incur U.S. dollar-denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the
Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on Wynn Macau’s ability to service its debt, its results of operations and its financial condition. We have not yet determined whether we will engage in hedging
activities to protect against foreign currency risk.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

.    The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that solely because of the one material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, as
of the end of such period, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.

Subsequent to the issuance of the
Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company determined that its interest rate swap arrangements relating to certain of its floating-rate debt facilities did not qualify for hedge accounting
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS No. 133”), and its related interpretations. The Company’s hedge documentation includes, among other
items, the assumption that


the repricing dates for its debt and swaps match. The documentation required to assess ineffectiveness resulting from having different repricing dates was
not in place at the inception of the hedge, nor during the periods for which an assessment was required, and the Company recently determined that the repricing dates on the swap instruments did not match exactly the repricing dates on the
floating-rate debt. Documentation deficiencies cannot be corrected, and quarterly testing cannot be performed, retrospectively. As a result, hedge accounting should not have been used. Accordingly, the Company determined that its 2003 and 2004
financial statements and its interim financial statements for the first three quarters of 2005 should be restated to eliminate the application of hedge accounting. Eliminating the application of cash flow hedge accounting results in recording the
mark to market adjustments for the interest rate swaps as interest and other income, net and not in comprehensive income, as was previously reported.

(b)

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that results in a
more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. At December 31, 2005, the Company’s controls over the formal designation, documentation and the continual
evaluation and assessment of its derivative instruments were not adequately designed to determine that derivative instruments were not appropriately accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133:

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

.

Based on our assessment, as a result of the material weakness described above
management believes that, as of December 31, 2005, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears under “Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting” on page F-2.

(c)

Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

.    There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal
quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the Company adopted additional
accounting policies and internal controls to address the issues raised by this material weakness.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Wynn Resorts, Limited

Las Vegas, Nevada

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, that Wynn Resorts, Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
because of the effect of the material weakness identified in management’s assessment based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment:

The
Company’s controls over the formal designation, documentation and the continual evaluation and assessment of its derivative instruments were not adequately designed to determine that derivative instruments

F-2

were not properly accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

.

This material weakness resulted in the restatement of the Company’s previously issued consolidated financial
statements as more fully described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005, of the Company and this report does not affect our report on such consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above, the Company has
not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005, of the Company and the financial statement schedule
of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts included in Item 15(a)(2), and our report dated March 15, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph related
to the restatement described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Wynn Resorts, Limited

Las Vegas, Nevada

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wynn Resorts, Limited
and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts included in Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wynn Resorts, Limited and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 15, 2006 expressed an unqualified
opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting because of a
material weakness.

As discussed in Note 17, the accompanying 2003 and 2004 consolidated financial statements have been restated.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Organization

Wynn Resorts,
Limited, a Nevada corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Wynn Resorts” or the “Company”), was formed in June 2002 and completed an initial public offering of its common stock on October 25, 2002. Wynn Resorts’
predecessor, Valvino Lamore, LLC (“Valvino”), was formed on April 21, 2000 as a Nevada limited liability company to purchase the Desert Inn Resort and Casino (the “Desert Inn”) for the site of the Company’s first casino
resort in Las Vegas, Nevada, hereinafter referred to as “Wynn Las Vegas.”

In June 2002, Valvino’s indirect subsidiary, Wynn
Resorts (Macau), S.A. (“Wynn Macau, S.A.”), entered into an agreement with the government of the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (“Macau”), granting Wynn Macau, S.A. the right to
construct and operate one or more casino gaming properties in Macau. Wynn Macau, S.A.’s first casino resort in Macau is hereinafter referred to as “Wynn Macau.”

The Company commenced operations with the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005. The construction and development of Wynn Macau and the
development of the Company’s expansion of Wynn Las Vegas, known as “Encore at Wynn Las Vegas” or “Encore,” are ongoing. For the periods presented prior to April 28, 2005, the Company was solely a development stage
company.

2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in the 50%-owned joint ventures operating the Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership and the Brioni mens’
retail clothing store inside Wynn Las Vegas are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform
to the 2005 presentation as follows:

•

The water rights, trademark and the Macau gaming concession, net listed separately in the 2004 presentation are classified together as Intangibles, net for 2005;

•

Show production rights were included in deposits and other assets in the 2004 presentation. These are recorded as Intangibles, net for 2005;

•

Certain advanced customer deposits were classified as Accrued expenses and other in the 2004 presentation. They are classified as customer deposits and other current liabilities for
2005;

•

Art gallery, retail and water revenues for 2004 and 2003, are classified as entertainment, retail and other revenues for 2005;

F-9

WYNN RESORTS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

•

The cost of water and the cost of retail sales for 2004 and 2003, are classified as entertainment, retail and other expenses for 2005; and

•

The gain/(loss) on sales of assets and the losses from incidental operations for 2004 and 2003 are classified as property charges and other for 2005.

These reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported net loss.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments with
purchase maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

Restricted Cash and
Investments

Restricted cash and investments consist of certificates of deposits to collateralize certain construction insurance claims,
cash deposits for certain sales taxes, and certain of the proceeds of the Company’s financing activities invested in approved money market funds or government-backed treasury notes and interest-only strips. Portions of these funds are
restricted by the agreements governing the Company’s debt instruments for the payment of certain construction and development costs relating to Wynn Las Vegas, Encore or Wynn Macau or for interest payments on certain of the Company’s debt.
Amounts classified as current are equal to current construction payables and other accruals also classified as current.

The Company
classifies its marketable securities in one of three categories: held-to-maturity, trading or available-for-sale, in accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” In accordance with
SFAS No. 115, held-to-maturity securities are those securities for which a company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. All
other securities are classified as available-for-sale. The Company’s marketable debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity. Accordingly, these securities are recorded at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums or accretion of
discounts. The carrying value of these marketable securities approximates fair value due to their relatively short-term maturities and market rates of interest.

Restricted cash and investments at December 31, 2005 and 2004 also include approximately $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of accrued interest receivable on the marketable securities.

Accounts Receivable and Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of casino accounts receivable. The Company issues credit in the form of “markers” to approved casino customers
following investigations of creditworthiness. At December 31, 2005, approximately 70% of the Company’s receivables were due from customers residing in foreign countries. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these
countries could affect the collectibility of such receivables.

Accounts receivable, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically
non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems them to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts
is maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts as well as management’s experience with collection trends
in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions.

WYNN RESORTS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Inventories

Retail, food and beverage inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out and specific identification methods.

Property and Equipment

Purchases of
property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method as follows:

Costs related to improvements are capitalized, while costs of building repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income or loss. The
design, development and construction costs for Wynn Macau and Encore are capitalized and depreciation has not yet commenced.

Capitalized Interest

The interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized. Interest
capitalization ceases once a project is substantially complete or no longer undergoing construction activities to prepare it for its intended use. When no debt is specifically identified as being incurred in connection with a construction project,
the Company capitalizes interest on amounts expended on the project at the Company’s weighted average cost of borrowed money. Interest of $50.0 million, $115.0 million, $87.3 million was capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Intangibles

The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of water rights acquired as part of the overall purchase price of the Desert Inn, and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
amortized, but are periodically reviewed for impairment. The Company’s finite-lived intangible assets consist of a Macau gaming concession and show production rights. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of their
contractual terms or estimated useful lives.

Deferred Financing Costs

Direct and incremental costs incurred in obtaining loans or in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are capitalized and amortized to interest
over the terms of the related debt agreements. Approximately $14.0 million, $14.2 million, and $9.6 million was amortized to interest during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For deferred financing costs recognized
at December 31, 2005, the Company expects approximately $14.2 million will be amortized to interest for 2006; that approximately $13.8 million will be amortized to each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2010; approximately $12.8 million is
expected to be amortized in 2011; $4.4 million amortized for the years 2012 and 2013; $4.0 million for 2014; and the remaining amount of approximately $400,000 is expected to be amortized in 2015. Accumulated amortization amounted to $16.1 million
and $21.5 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

F-11

WYNN RESORTS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, which are not to be disposed of, including intangibles and property and equipment, are periodically reviewed by management for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. For assets to be held and used, the Company reviews fixed assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. If
an indicator of impairment exists, the Company compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated.
If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value, with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development,
future cash flows include remaining construction costs.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company seeks to manage its market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and
variable-rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as
amended. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) as applicable. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
Company recorded approximately $8.2 million, $1.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively, as interest and other income as a result of increases in the fair values of its interest rate swaps during those periods.

Revenue Recognition and Promotional Allowances

The Company recognizes revenues at the time persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is provided or the retail goods are sold, prices are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.

Casino revenues are measured by the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for funds
deposited by customers before gaming play occurs and for chips in the customers’ possession. Hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other operating revenues are recognized when services are performed. Advance deposits on rooms and advance
ticket sales are recorded as customer deposits until services are provided to the customer.

Revenues are recognized net of certain sales
incentives in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) consensus on Issue 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products).” EITF 01-9
requires that sales incentives be recorded as a reduction of revenue; consequently, the Company’s casino revenues are reduced by discounts and points earned in customer loyalty programs, such as the player’s club loyalty program.

F-12

WYNN RESORTS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without
charge is included in gross revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances. The estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, is primarily included in casino
expenses as follows (amounts in thousands):

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising runs. Advertising expenses incurred in development periods are included in
preopening expenses. Since the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005, advertising costs relating to Wynn Las Vegas have been included in general and administrative expenses, while any advertising expenses relating to Wynn Macau or Encore
continue to be included in preopening expenses. Total advertising expenses were $18.3 million, $2.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Pre-Opening Costs

Pre-opening costs,
consisting primarily of salaries and wages, legal and consulting fees, insurance, and utilities and travel, are expensed as incurred.

Incidental Operations

Upon completion of the acquisition of the Desert Inn on June 22, 2000, the Company announced its
intention to close the property and to plan the development of Wynn Las Vegas on the existing site. The Company operated the Desert Inn for about ten weeks and the golf course through June 2002. In July 2004, the Company purchased an apartment
complex and associated land, ceased operating the apartments and demolished the complex for the development of an employee parking lot. In accordance with SFAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate
Projects,” collection efforts associated with the former operations of the Desert Inn and the brief operation of the apartments are accounted for as separate incidental operations. Under this method, incidental operations with a net income are
excluded from the Company’s consolidated operating results and the net income from each is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of land. Incidental operations with a net loss are included in property charges and other in the
consolidated statements of operations. The amount of net income from incidental operations recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of land was approximately $0, $4.2 million, and $0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” SFAS No. 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and
liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit

F-13

WYNN RESORTS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

SFAS No. 109 also requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a
valuation allowance is applied. During its development stage the Company accumulated significant net operating losses. Accordingly, at December 31, 2005, the Company has an estimated available U.S. tax loss carryforward of approximately $298.4
million, which expires between 2022 and 2025. The Company’s foreign tax loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2005, resulting from the loss in Macau, are approximately $98.2 million. These foreign tax loss carryforwards expire between 2006
and 2008. Because of the uncertainty of near-term future taxable income, the Company’s potential net future domestic and foreign tax benefits of approximately $100.2 million and $11.8 million, respectively as of December 31, 2005 and $82.8
million and $7.6 million, respectively as of December 31, 2004, are fully reserved. These valuation allowances will be removed when the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.

Currency Translation

The Company accounts for currency translation in accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation.” The results of operations and the balance sheet of Wynn Macau, S.A. are translated from Macau Patacas to U.S.
dollars. Balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process
are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (loss). During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the effect of foreign currency translation was immaterial.

Earnings Per Share

Earnings per
share are calculated in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 128, “Earnings Per Share.” SFAS No. 128 provides for the reporting of “basic”, or undiluted earnings per share
(“EPS”), and “diluted” EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the addition of potentially dilutive securities. For each of
the three years ended December 31, 2005, the Company has recorded net losses. Accordingly, the assumed exercise of stock options and the potential conversion of the Company’s $250 million of 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2015
(the “Debentures”) was anti-dilutive. As a result, basic EPS is equal to diluted EPS for all periods presented. Potentially dilutive securities that were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS at December 31, 2005 because
including them would have been anti-dilutive, included 3,459,800 shares under stock options, 789,169 shares under non-vested stock grants and 10,869,550 shares under the assumed conversion of the Debentures. At December 31, 2004, potentially
dilutive but excluded securities included 2,271,750 shares under stock options, 1,138,338 shares under non-vested stock grants and 10,869,550 shares under the assumed conversion of the Debentures.

Employee Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has a stock-based employee compensation plan as more fully described in Note 12. Benefit Plans. As permitted by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of
FASB Statement No. 123,” the Company continues to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock-based compensation. Accordingly,
compensation expense is recognized only to the extent that the market value at the

F-14

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

date of grant exceeds the exercise price. The following table illustrates the effect on the net loss if the Company had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” to stock-based employee compensation (amounts in thousands).

Equity Instruments Issued to Consultants and Vendors

The Company’s accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments That are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services” and EITF 00-18, “Accounting Recognition
for Certain Transactions Involving Equity Instruments Granted to Other Than Employees.” The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for
performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor’s performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized
over the term of the consulting agreement.

On October 21, 2002, the Company entered into an amended production services agreement
with the executive producer of the water-based live theatrical attraction named “Le Reve,” which commenced upon opening Wynn Las Vegas. As additional compensation for the production services, the Company granted 189,723 restricted shares
of Wynn Resorts’ common stock to the executive producer, which will vest on June 30, 2006.

On May 4, 2004, the Company
granted 25,000 nonqualified stock options to a consultant to assist in the development and initial operation of the Wynn Las Vegas lake-mountain feature. These options vest 25% per year. The first 25% vested in May 2005. In accordance with the
above policy, the measurement date is the date performance is complete and the mark-to-market fair value of the options is recognized as compensation cost amortized over the service period. When the service period ended in May 2005, the Company
capitalized approximately $508,000 into the Wynn Las Vegas project to reflect the value of this stock option grant.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R), “Share Based Payment.” This statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for

F-15

WYNN RESORTS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an
entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity
instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. The Company will
adopt this statement, according to SEC rule, as amended, on January 1, 2006, utilizing the modified prospective method and the Black-Scholes valuation model.

In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulleting (“SAB”) No. 107, “Share-Based Payment “ to provide interpretive guidance on SFAS No. 123(R) valuation methods, assumptions used in
valuation models, and the interaction of SFAS No. 123(R) with existing SEC guidance. SAB No. 107 also requires the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and will
therefore impact the Company’s departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for development projects, and general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses). Expensing
stock options is estimated to reduce the Company’s net income for 2006 by approximately $12.8 million (or $0.13 per share) for the unvested options outstanding as of December 31, 2005.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” This statement amends the
guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously
stated, that “…under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges….” This statement
requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal.” In addition, this statement requires that allocation of the fixed production overheads to the costs of
conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Accordingly, the Company will adopt its provisions effective January 1, 2006. The Company
does not anticipate that adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions

,

”
is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. This Statement amends Opinion 29
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if
the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. Adoption of this statement on July 1, 2005, did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

In March 2005, FASB issued FIN No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations”. FIN
No. 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the
timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an
asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective December 31, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Intangibles, net consist of the following:

Water rights reflect the fair value allocation determined in the purchase of the Desert Inn in
April 2000. The value of the trademarks primarily represents the costs to acquire the “Le Reve” name. The water rights and trademarks are indefinite-lived assets and, accordingly, not amortized. Show production rights represents the
amounts paid to purchase the rights to “Avenue Q” and to “Monty Python’s Spamalot.” The Company expects that amortization of show production rights will be approximately $4.8 million in 2006, approximately $2.0 million for
the years 2007 through 2010, and approximately $1.0 million in 2011.

In September 2004, the Company acquired all of the 17.5% indirect
ownership interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. held by third parties, in exchange for 1,333,333 shares of Wynn Resorts’ common stock. Mr. Wong Chi Seng, one of the third parties, retained a direct 10% voting interest in Wynn Macau, S.A. and
agreed to continue to serve as Executive Director. Mr. Wong’s shares provide in the aggregate a nominal preferential annual dividend and capital distribution rights of up to one Macau pataca (US$0.12). As a result of the acquisition, Wynn
Macau, S.A. effectively became a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Wynn Resorts.

The average price of Wynn Resorts’ common stock
around August 31, 2004 (the deemed effective date of the acquisition), was $38.69 per share. The excess of the purchase price of the minority interests over the net liabilities assumed plus the value of the stock exchanged, less the costs to
register the shares, was approximately $51.4 million. Upon obtaining third party appraisals of the land and gaming concessions, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired: $42.3 million was allocated to the gaming concession; and the
remaining $9.1 million was allocated to increase the book value of the leasehold interest in land. The gaming concession intangible is being amortized over the 20-year life of the concession. The Company expects that amortization of the gaming
concession will be approximately $2.4 million each year from 2006 through 2021, and approximately $1.2 million in 2022.

The Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the First Mortgage Notes at any time prior to December 1, 2007 at a redemption
price equal to 106.625% of the principal amount redeemed (plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption) with the proceeds of one or more of the Company’s qualified equity offerings that are contributed to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC.
Commencing December 1, 2009, the First Mortgage Notes are redeemable at the Company’s option at a premium equal to 103.313% of the principal amount redeemed and declining ratably on December first of each year thereafter to zero on or
after December 1, 2012.

The indenture governing the First Mortgage Notes contains covenants limiting the ability of the Issuers to
incur additional debt, make distributions, investments and restricted payments, create liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, sell assets, enter into sale leaseback transactions, permit restrictions on dividends and other payments by
subsidiaries, or engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of substantially all assets, sales of subsidiary stock and other specified types of transactions. Management believes the Company is in compliance with all such covenants as of
December 31, 2005.

The First Mortgage Notes are obligations of the Issuers, guaranteed by each of the subsidiaries of Wynn Las Vegas,
LLC, other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC. Wynn Resorts, Limited does not guarantee the obligations of the Issuers. Subject to an intercreditor agreement and certain exceptions, the First Mortgage Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured
by: (1) a first priority security interest in a liquidity reserve account (currently $30.0 million), which may be used to meet Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s debt service needs in connection with the operation of Wynn Las Vegas; (2) all
amounts on deposit from time to time (currently $50.0 million) in a completion guarantee deposit account maintained by Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC; (3) a first priority pledge of all of the member’s interests owned by Wynn Las Vegas,
LLC in its subsidiaries (other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC) and of Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC’s 100% member’s interest in Wynn Las Vegas, LLC; (4) first mortgages on all real property constituting Wynn Las Vegas, its golf
course and Encore; and (5) a first priority security interest in substantially all other existing and future assets of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors, excluding, among other things, an aircraft beneficially owned by World Travel, LLC.
The First Mortgage Notes are also secured by certain of the net proceeds from the sale of the First Mortgage Notes.

The obligations of the
Issuers and the guarantors under the First Mortgage Notes rank equal to the right of payment with their existing and future senior secured indebtedness, including indebtedness with respect to the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities described
below, and rank senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness.

Convertible Subordinated
Debentures

In July 2003, the Company sold $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Debentures. The Company pays interest on the
Debentures on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning January 15, 2004. The Company contributed a total of approximately $44.0 million to a subsidiary, Wynn Resorts Funding, LLC, which purchased U.S. government securities to
secure the payment of scheduled interest payments occurring in 2004, 2005 and 2006 as required by the indenture governing the Debentures.

Each $1,000 principal amount of the Debentures is convertible at each holder’s option into 43.4782 shares of the Company’s common stock (subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture governing the Debentures), a conversion
rate equivalent to a conversion price of $23.00 per share. The Company may redeem some or all of the debentures for cash on or after July 20, 2007, at prices specified in the indenture governing the Debentures. In addition, the holders may
require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Debentures, subject to certain exceptions, following a change of control of the Company.

Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities

Previous Credit Facilities and FF&E Facility.

Effective October 30, 2002, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC entered into a
$750.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Previous Revolver”) and a $250.0 million delay draw senior secured term loan facility (the “Previous Term Loan”, and together with the Previous Revolver, the
“Previous Credit Facilities”) as part of the financing for Wynn Las Vegas. The Previous Revolver was later increased to $800.0 million.

On December 14, 2004, the Company refinanced its debt structure. As part of this refinancing, the Company terminated the Previous Credit Facilities and repaid the approximately $458.6 million principal amount outstanding. The Company
recorded a loss on the extinguishment of the debt of approximately $1.1 million from the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs. The Previous Credit Facilities were replaced with the credit facilities described below.

Effective October 30, 2002, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC also entered into a $188.5 million FF&E facility (the “FF&E
Facility”) to provide financing for furniture, fixtures and equipment to be used at Wynn Las Vegas.

On December 14, 2004, as
part of the refinancing of the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC indebtedness, the Company terminated the FF&E Facility and repaid the approximately $70.3 million principal amount outstanding. The Company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of the debt of
approximately $9.6 million, comprised of a $1.6 million prepayment penalty and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $8.0 million.

Credit Facilities.

On December 14, 2004, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) and related ancillary agreements for secured
revolving credit and term loan facilities in the aggregate amount of $1.0 billion. The credit facilities (the “Credit Facilities”) consist of a revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) in the amount of $600.0 million and a term
loan facility (the “Term Loans”) in the amount of $400.0 million.

The Revolver will terminate and be payable in full on
December 14, 2009, and the Term Loans will mature on December 14, 2011.

The amount available under the Credit Facilities will be
reduced by $550.0 million if the budget, plans and specifications for Encore (the “Encore Budget, Plans and Specs”) have not been approved by a majority of the arrangers or a majority of the lenders under the Credit Agreement by
March 31, 2006. This may result in a reduction of availability under the Revolver, prepayment of loans under the Term Loans or any combination of the two.

For purposes of calculating interest, loans under the Credit Facilities will be designated, at the election of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, as Eurodollar Loans or, in certain circumstances, Base Rate Loans. Eurodollar Loans
under the Revolver and Term Loans bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 2.25%

F-21

WYNN RESORTS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

and LIBOR plus 2.125%, respectively. Interest on Eurodollar Loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period in the case of interest periods of
one, two or three months, and every three months in the case of interest periods of six months. Base Rate Loans are expected to bear interest at (a) the greater of (i) the rate most recently announced by Deutsche Bank as its “prime
rate,” or (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1% per annum; plus (b) a borrowing margin 1.25% or 1.125% under the Revolver and Term Loans, respectively. Interest on Base Rate Loans will be payable quarterly in arrears.

Provided that Encore qualifies for financing under the Disbursement Agreement (as defined below), after the opening of Encore, the
applicable borrowing margins for revolving loans will be based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s leverage ratio, ranging from 1.25% to 2.5% per annum for Eurodollar Loans and 0.25% to 1.5% per annum for Base Rate Loans. Until then, Wynn Las
Vegas, LLC will pay, quarterly in arrears, 0.75% per annum on the daily average of unborrowed availability under the revolving credit facility. After opening Encore, the annual fee Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will be required to pay for unborrowed
availability under the revolving credit facility will be based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s leverage ratio, ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum.

The Credit Facilities are obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, guaranteed by each of the subsidiaries of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC. Subject to an intercreditor agreement, and
certain exceptions, the obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and each of the guarantors under the Credit Facilities are secured by: (1) a first priority security interest in a liquidity reserve account (currently $30.0 million), which may be used
to meet Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s debt service needs in connection with the operation of Wynn Las Vegas; (2) all amounts on deposit from time to time (currently $50.0 million) in a completion guarantee deposit account maintained by Wynn
Completion Guarantor, LLC; (3) all amounts on deposit from time to time in a secured account holding the proceeds of the Credit Facilities; (4) a first priority pledge of all member’s interests owned by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC in its
subsidiaries (other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC) and Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC’s 100% member’s interest in Wynn Las Vegas, LLC; (5) first mortgages on all real property constituting Wynn Las Vegas, its golf course and Encore;
and (6) a first priority security interest in substantially all other existing and future assets of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors, excluding an aircraft beneficially owned by World Travel, LLC.

The obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors under the Credit Facilities rank equal in right of payment with their existing and future
senior indebtedness, including indebtedness with respect to the First Mortgage Notes and ranks senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness.

In addition to scheduled amortization payments, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC is required to make mandatory prepayments of indebtedness under the Credit Facilities
from the net proceeds of all debt offerings (other than those constituting certain permitted debt). After opening Encore (assuming the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are approved prior to March 31, 2006), Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will also be
required to make mandatory repayments of indebtedness under the Credit Facilities from specified percentages of excess cash flow, which percentages may decrease and/or be eliminated based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s leverage ratio. Wynn Las Vegas,
LLC has the option to prepay all or any portion of the indebtedness under the Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty.

The Credit Agreement contains customary negative covenants and financial covenants, including negative covenants that restrict Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s ability to: incur additional indebtedness, including guarantees; create, incur, assume
or permit to exist liens on property and assets; declare or pay dividends and make distributions or restrict the ability of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions; engage in mergers, investments and
acquisitions; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; execute modifications to material contracts; engage in sales of assets; make capital expenditures; and make optional prepayments of certain indebtedness.
The financial covenants include

(i) maintaining a ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to total interest expense, and (ii) maintaining a ratio
of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in
compliance with all covenants.

Wynn Macau Credit Facilities

On September 14, 2004, Wynn Macau, S.A. executed a definitive credit agreement and related ancillary agreements for a senior secured bank facility of
$397.0 million. The senior secured bank facility consisted of term loan facilities in the amount of $382.0 million (in a combination of Hong Kong and US dollars) and a revolving working capital facility of HK$117.0 million (approximately US$15.0
million).

In September 2005, to accommodate Wynn Macau’s second phase, Wynn Macau, S.A., amended its senior bank facility to expand
availability under the facility from $397 million to $764 million, including $729 million of senior term loan facilities, a HK$117 million revolving credit facility (approximately US$15 million), and an additional term loan facility of HK$156
million (approximately US$20 million). Wynn Macau, S.A. began borrowing under the senior secured credit facilities in the fourth quarter of 2005 after the proceeds from $230.0 million in base equity loans and an $80.0 million subordinated loan
provided by Wynn Resorts were expended on the Wynn Macau project, and certain other conditions precedent customary to limited recourse project finance construction were satisfied.

The term loan facilities mature in September 2011, and the revolving credit facility matures in September 2007. The principal amount of the term loans is
required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing on March 14, 2008. The term loans bear interest at LIBOR or the Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate (“HIBOR”) plus a margin of 3.0% until the opening of Wynn Macau (expected in
the third quarter of 2006), at which time the interest rate will reduce to LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 2.75%. The senior bank facility also provides for further reductions in the margin on the term loans if Wynn Macau, S.A. satisfies certain
prescribed leverage ratio tests. Loans under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at HIBOR plus 2.5%.

Collateral for the
senior bank facility consists of substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. Certain affiliates of the Company that own interests in Wynn Macau, S.A., either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, have executed guarantees of the
loans and pledged their interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. as additional security for repayment of the loans. In addition, the senior bank facility’s governing documents contain capital spending limits and other affirmative and negative covenants.
As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

In September 2004, in connection with the initial
financing of the Wynn Macau project, Wynn Macau, S.A. entered into a Bank Guarantee Reimbursement Agreement with Banco Nacional Ultramarino (“BNU”) for a guarantee in the amount of 700.0 million patacas (approximately US$87.0
million). This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures Wynn Macau, S.A.’s performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform
the concession agreement. To secure the guarantee, Wynn Macau, S.A. originally deposited $50.0 million of the $230.0 million base equity loans with BNU. As of December 31, 2005, however, Wynn Macau, S.A. had funded $50.0 million of its project
costs with these funds. The guarantee is currently secured by a second priority security interest in the senior lender collateral package. From and after repayment of all indebtedness under the senior bank facilities, Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated
to promptly, upon demand by BNU, repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. BNU will be paid an annual fee for the guarantee not to exceed approximately 12.3 million Macau patacas (approximately US$1.5 million).

In addition, the Company has a $72.0 million contingent debt facility from Wynn Macau, S.A.’s lenders.

$44.75 million Note Payable

On May 24, 2005, World Travel, LLC, a subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, borrowed an aggregate amount of $44.75 million under term loans, which
terminate and are payable in full on May 24, 2010. The term loans are guaranteed by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and secured by a first priority security interest in one of the Company’s two aircraft. Principal and interest is payable quarterly,
and interest is calculated at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.375%. In addition to scheduled amortization payments, the Company is required to prepay the loans if certain events of loss with respect to the aircraft occur. Beginning on December 31,
2006, the Company may prepay all or any portion of the loans subject to a minimum prepayment of $10.0 million.

Notes
Payable—Aircraft

The notes require monthly payments of principal and interest totaling approximately $124,000 through June 2011,
reducing to approximately $27,000 for July through September 2011. There are also balloon payments due in June and September of 2011 of approximately $7.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively. The notes are secured by liens on one of the
Company’s two aircraft.

Second Mortgage Notes

On October 30, 2002, the Issuers issued $370.0 million aggregate principal amount of 12% second mortgage notes (the “Second Mortgage Notes”) maturing November 1, 2010 with semi-annual interest
payments beginning in May 2003.

The Second Mortgage Notes were issued for approximately $343.3 million, net of an original issue discount
of approximately $26.7 million and issuance costs of approximately $14.4 million. The net proceeds were used to finance the development and construction of Wynn Las Vegas, to pay pre-opening expenses and meet debt service obligations.

On June 14, 2004, the Issuers redeemed approximately $122.4 million of the Second Mortgage Notes. The total price of the redemption was
approximately $138.9 million, equal to 112.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In connection with the redemption, the Company wrote off approximately $7.0 million of the unamortized
original issue discount and approximately $3.9 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the notes. Accordingly, the Company recognized a loss on the early retirement of debt of approximately $25.6 million to reflect these
write-offs and the $14.7 million redemption premium.

On December 14, 2004, the Issuers purchased approximately $237.4 million in
aggregate principal amount of the Second Mortgage Notes and effected a discharge of the Second Mortgage Notes indenture and related collateral documents. The approximately $10.1 million principal amount of Second Mortgage Notes remaining outstanding
has been called for redemption in accordance with the indenture on November 1, 2006, at a price of 112% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

In order to effect the satisfaction and discharge, the Issuers deposited in trust with the trustee of the Second Mortgage Notes government securities
with an aggregate face value of approximately $10.1 million and approximately $3.0 million of additional funds (the amounts necessary to pay when due all interest payments and the redemption price on the redemption date), to satisfy and discharge
the remaining amounts payable under the Second Mortgage Notes indenture. As a result of the satisfaction and discharge, the Issuers are not subject to any restrictive covenants under the Second Mortgage Notes indenture, and the guarantees and
collateral securing the Second Mortgage Notes were released. However, the Company will continue to report the outstanding liability

and the associated cash restricted for the repayment on its balance sheet until the Second Mortgage Notes are redeemed on November 1, 2006, from the
funds deposited in trust.

Fair Value of Long-term Debt

The net book value of the First Mortgage Notes and the Debentures at December 31, 2005 was approximately $1.3 billion and $250.0 million,
respectively. The estimated fair value of the First Mortgage Notes and the Debentures based upon most recent trades at December 31, 2005 was approximately $1.3 billion and $596.2 million, respectively. The Company discharged its Second Mortgage
Notes as previously noted, however, the net book value and the fair value of the Second Mortgage Notes (based upon the November 1, 2006 call premium of 12%), was approximately $11.8 million and $9.7 million as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively. The net book value of the Company’s other debt instruments approximates fair value.

levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a
high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods.

Wynn Las Vegas

During 2003, the Company entered into two interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $825.0 million of
borrowings under the Previous Credit Facilities. Although these interest rate swaps were highly effective in fixing the interest on the applicable portion of underlying debt, the changes in the fair values of these instruments have been recorded as
a component of interest and other income in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133. On December 14, 2004, concurrent with the refinancing of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s debt structure, the Company terminated these two interest rate
swaps. As a result of the termination, the Company received a cash payment of approximately $9.6 million in settlement of the related asset.

Concurrent with the refinancing, The Company entered into two new interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $400.0 million of borrowings under the current Wynn Las Vegas, LLC term loan
facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.125%. Under each of these two interest rate swap arrangements, the Company receives payments at a variable rate of LIBOR and pays a fixed rate of 3.793% on $200 million notional amount set forth in the
swap instruments from February and March 2005, respectively through December 2008. These interest rate swaps are economically effective in fixing the interest rate on these borrowings under the new term loan facility at approximately 5.9%. Changes
in fair value of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period are recognized as a component of interest and other income in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133.

Wynn Macau

On October 14, 2005,
the Company entered into two interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on future borrowings under Wynn Macau S.A.’s $749 million senior term loan facility. Under the first swap agreement, the Company pays a
fixed interest rate of 4.84% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately $198.2 million, in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable
LIBOR at the time of payment. Under the second swap agreement, the Company pays a fixed interest rate of 4.77% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately HK$1.1 billion (approximately
US$140.3 million), in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. The term of both swap agreements is from November 28, 2005 through November 28, 2008.

These interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective in fixing the interest rate on 50% of the US dollar and 50% of the Hong Kong
dollar borrowings under the senior bank facility at approximately 7.84% and 7.77%, respectively. Changes in fair value of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period are recognized as a component of interest and other income in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 133.

Stock under certain circumstances could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company or other corporate action.

12.    Benefit Plans

Employee Savings Plan

The Company established a retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code covering its non-union employees on July 27, 2000. The plan allows employees to defer, within prescribed limits, up to 18% of their income on a pre-tax basis through contributions to this plan. The Company matches the contributions, within
prescribed limits, with an amount equal to 100% of the participant’s initial 2% tax deferred contribution and 50% of the tax deferred contribution between 2% and 4% of the participant’s compensation. The Company recorded charges for
matching contributions of approximately $804,000, $366,000, and $263,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Union employees were covered by various multi-employer pension plans. The Company recorded expenses of approximately $1.3 million, $4,000, and $38,000 under such plans for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Information from the plans’ sponsors is not available to permit the Company to determine its share of unfunded vested benefits, if any.

Stock Based Compensation Plan

The Company has adopted the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Stock Plan”) to provide
stock compensation arrangements for directors, officers and key employees, and others. The Stock Plan includes provisions for the grant of (i) Incentive Stock Options (“ISO”), (ii) compensatory (i.e. nonqualified) stock options
(“NQSO”) and (iii) restricted shares of Common Stock. Officers, key employees, directors (whether employee or nonemployee) and independent contractors or consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate in
the Stock Plan. However, only employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to receive incentive stock options.

A maximum of
9,750,000 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance under the Stock Plan. Options are generally granted at the current market price at the date of grant. The Stock Plan provides for a variety of vesting schedules, including: immediate; 25%
each year over four years; 33.33% for each of the third, fourth and fifth years; cliff vesting at a determined date; and others to be determined at the time of grant. All options expire ten years from the date of grant.

F-29

WYNN RESORTS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Stock Plan will terminate ten years from the date of adoption, unless terminated earlier by the
Board of Directors, and no options or restricted shares may be granted under the Stock Plan after such date. Summarized information for the Stock Plan is as follows:

The following table summarizes information about the options outstanding at December 31,
2005:

The average fair value of options granted of $24.13, $16.72 and $7.35 for the years ended December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing method with the following weighted-average assumptions:

In addition to options, restricted stock grants of 275,000 shares, 189,723 shares, and 1,138,338
shares were issued to employees during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2003 and 2002. 189,723 shares under these

F-30

WYNN RESORTS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

grants were forfeited as of December 31, 2003 and another 189,723 shares under these grants vested on November 1, 2004. On May 31, 2005,
379,446 shares vested and on December 15, 2005, 55,000 shares vested. The remaining 789,169 employee restricted stock grants outstanding at December 31, 2005 vest on various dates between May 2006 and December 2009. No restricted stock
grants took place during the year ended December 31, 2004 or prior to 2002. The effect of these grants is to increase the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock and decrease the number of shares available for grant in
the plan. Deferred compensation is recorded for the restricted stock grants equal to the market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. The deferred compensation is amortized over the period the restricted stock vests and is recorded as
compensation expense or capitalized into construction in progress, as appropriate.

Performance Based Incentive Plan

The Company established the Annual Performance Based Incentive Plan for Executive Officers (the “Performance Plan”) on March 8, 2004. Only
those executive officers of the Company who are “covered employees,” as defined under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, are eligible to participate in the Performance Plan. The Performance Plan qualifies for the
performance-based exclusion from the deduction limitations under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code which disallows deductions for publicly-held corporations with respect to compensation in excess of $1.0 million per year paid to the
Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s other four most highly compensated executive officers unless certain objectivity and other criteria are met.

The minimum performance goals set by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Wynn Resorts, Limited for 2004 were satisfied. Consequently, in 2005, three of the Company’s executives were paid an
aggregate of approximately $4.4 million under the Performance Plan for services rendered during 2004. The Company also has accrued approximately $7.4 million for amounts expected to be awarded under the Performance Plan for services rendered for
2005.

13.    Income Taxes

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. The income tax benefit differs from that computed at the federal statutory corporate tax rate as follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The tax effects of significant temporary differences representing net deferred tax assets and
liabilities are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Of the 2005 U.S. valuation allowance of $100.2 million, approximately $11.5 million is
attributable to tax benefits resulting from the exercise of nonqualified stock options, the value of vested restricted stock in excess of amounts deducted for financial reporting and syndication costs. Subsequent recognition of income tax benefits
associated with these items will be allocated to additional paid-in capital.

14.    Commitments and Contingencies

Wynn Las Vegas

Construction
and Remodeling.

Wynn Las Vegas, except for one of its two theaters, opened on April 28, 2005. The total Wynn Las Vegas project cost was approximately $2.74 billion. This includes the purchase of the Desert Inn
land (including the land for Encore) and additional land for employee parking, design and construction costs, financing fees, interest and other pre-opening expenses. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $18.9 million of budgeted project
costs and retention amounts remained to be paid in order to close out the project. The Company expects these final costs to be paid in the second quarter of 2006.

F-32

WYNN RESORTS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, the Company has made and continues to make certain
enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas. As a result, the Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures relating to these enhancements and refinements. Under the terms of the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities, the
Company is permitted up to $40.0 million of capital expenditures in 2005, of which $37.9 million was spent. In 2006, the Company will be permitted $80.0 million of capital expenditures at Wynn Las Vegas. These spending limits do not apply to any
funds that may be contributed to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC by Wynn Resorts.

Encore Development.

The Company
intends to develop Encore on approximately 20 acres facing the Strip, immediately adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. The Company has refined the design of Encore to include a 2,054-room hotel tower fully integrated with Wynn Las Vegas, containing 144
suites and 1,910 guest rooms, as well as an approximately 44,000 square foot casino, additional convention and meeting space, as wells as restaurants, nightclubs, swimming pools, a spa and salon and retail outlets. We expect to commence construction
of Encore in the second quarter of 2006 and to open Encore to the public by the end of 2008. The Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are expected to be finalized and submitted to the Company’s lenders for approval on or before March 15, 2006.
The project budget for Encore is approximately $1.74 billion, including approximately $70.0 million to be incurred for construction of a new employee parking garage on our Koval property, a related pedestrian bridge and costs to be incurred in
connection with preparing the Broadway Theater to host “Monty Python’s Spamalot”.

Until the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs
are approved, the availability of notes proceeds and funds under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities for this project is limited to $100.0 million, of which approximately $40.7 million has been spent through December 31, 2005. If the
Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are not approved, the available borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities would be reduced by $550.0 million. The Company expects that the available remaining proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes,
together with availability under the credit facilities, and cash flow from operations, will be sufficient for Wynn Las Vegas, LLC to pay for expenditures of up to $1.52 billion on the Encore project without incurring additional debt or receiving
additional capital contributions from Wynn Resorts. Project costs exceeding $1.52 billion will be financed by the issuance of up to $100.0 million of additional notes and/or contributions from Wynn Resorts.

Entertainment Productions.

The Company entered into long-term agreements for the licensing, creation, development
and production of “Le Rêve, A Small Collection of Imperfect Dreams,” the water-based production show, which opened concurrently with Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005.

The Company also purchased the rights to stage “Avenue Q,” the Tony Award-winning musical production and entered into a production services
agreement for all production services related to the show. In August 2005, “Avenue Q” opened to the public in Wynn Las Vegas’ second showroom, the Broadway Theater.

Under the agreements relating to “Le Rêve” and “Avenue Q,” the Company is required to make payments to the creators and
producers of each show based upon certain criteria including net ticket sales or profits.

On July 20, 2005, the Company also entered
into an agreement with Spamalot, LLC to produce and present “Monty Python’s Spamalot” at Wynn Las Vegas. The production is expected to be accompanied by a retail store, food and beverage facilities and a themed “Spamalot
Environment.” The production costs, showroom renovation costs, the production completion date, and the opening date have not yet been determined.

Completion Guarantee and Liquidity Reserve.

As part of the original Wynn Las Vegas financing, the Company contributed $50.0 million of the net proceeds of the initial public
offering of Wynn Resorts’ common stock to Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC, a special purpose subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC formed in October 2002 to provide a completion guarantee in favor of the lenders under the Previous Credit Facilities
and the Second Mortgage Notes to secure completion of Wynn Las Vegas.

F-33

WYNN RESORTS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In addition, the Company deposited $30.0 million from the net proceeds of the initial public offering
of Wynn Resorts’ common stock into a required escrow Liquidity Reserve Account to secure the completion and opening of Wynn Las Vegas.

The refinanced indebtedness of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC retained both the completion guarantee deposit and the liquidity reserve. The liquidity reserve is solely for use of the Wynn Las Vegas project, which will be finally closed out in March or
April 2006. If the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are approved, at least $30.0 million of the $50.0 million completion guarantee is required to remain on deposit in the completion guarantee collateral account to complete Encore.

Wynn Macau

Construction and
Development.

Under its casino concession agreement with the government of Macau, Wynn Macau, S.A. is constructing and will own and operate Wynn Macau, a casino resort facility in Macau’s inner harbor area. Wynn
Macau is being constructed, and will open, in two phases. The first phase of Wynn Macau is expected to open in the third quarter of 2006. The second phase is expected to open by the third quarter of 2007.

Construction of Wynn Macau’s first phase commenced in June 2004 under a guaranteed maximum price construction contract between Wynn Macau, S.A. and
Leighton Contractors (Asia) Limited, China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited and China Construction Engineering (Macau) Company Limited, acting together as general contractor. In September 2005, the construction contract was amended
and restated to include the second phase of Wynn Macau. Under the amended and restated construction contract, the general contractor is responsible for both the construction and design of the project (other than certain limited portions to be
designed by an affiliate of Wynn Macau, S.A.) based on an existing scope of work and design specifications provided by Wynn Macau, S.A., for a guaranteed maximum price of approximately $457.2 million (including the contractors’ fee and
contingency). The performance of the contractors is backed by a full completion guarantee given jointly and severally by Leighton Holdings Limited and China Overseas Holdings Limited, the parent companies of the contracting entities.

Through December 31, 2005, the Company incurred approximately $427.2 million of the total $1.1 billion of budgeted project costs. Total
budgeted project costs include construction and design costs (including construction contingencies) of approximately $688.0 million, land acquisition costs of approximately $49.0 million, and capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses, financing
fees and other costs totaling in the aggregate approximately $368.6 million. These costs have been, and will continue to be, paid from the previously funded $230.0 million base equity and loans from Wynn Resorts and $80.0 million borrowed under Wynn
Las Vegas, LLC’s revolving credit agreement and loaned as subordinated debt, as well as Wynn Macau, S.A.’s $764.0 million senior secured credit facility and cash flows from operations once Wynn Macau opens. As of December 31, 2005,
project costs still to be incurred totaled approximately $678.4 million.

Land Concession
Contract.

Wynn Macau, S.A. has entered into a land concession contract for the Wynn Macau project site. Under the land concession contract, Wynn Macau, S.A. leases a parcel of approximately 16 acres from the government
for an initial term of 25 years, with a right to renew for additional periods. Wynn Macau, S.A. has made three payments to the Macau government under the land concession contract totaling approximately $12.7 million and is required to make eight
additional semi-annual payments (including interest) totaling approximately $30.0 million for total payments of approximately $42.7 million. Wynn Macau, S.A. also paid approximately $17.9 million to an unrelated third party for its relinquishment of
rights to a portion of the land. During the term of the land concession contract, Wynn Macau, S.A. is also required to make annual lease payments of up to $400,000.

Leases and other arrangements

The Company is the lessor under five retail leases and has entered into license and distribution agreements for six additional retail outlets. The Company
also is a party to joint venture agreements for the operation of one other retail outlet and the Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership at Wynn Las Vegas. Each of these retail outlets opened concurrently with the opening of Wynn Las Vegas. In
connection with these arrangements, Wynn Las Vegas provided certain of the retail tenants an allowance for improvements. These improvement allowances were included in the budgeted costs to construct Wynn Las Vegas.

The following represents the future minimum rentals to be received under the operating leases:

In addition, the Company is the lessee under several leases for office space in Las Vegas, Macau
and certain other locations, warehouse facilities, the land underlying the Company’s aircraft hangar and certain office equipment. The Company also leases land from the government of Macau for the site of Wynn Macau.

At December 31, 2005, the Company was obligated under non-cancelable operating leases and the leasehold interest in land to make future minimum
lease payments as follows ($ amounts in thousands):

Self-insurance

The Company’s domestic subsidiaries are covered under a self-insured medical plan up to a maximum of $200,000 per year for each insured person.
Amounts in excess of these thresholds are covered by the Company’s insurance programs, subject to customary policy limits. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries are fully-insured.

Employment Agreements

The Company has entered into employment agreements with several executive officers, other members of management and certain key employees. These
agreements, other than Mr. Wynn’s, generally have three- to five-year terms and typically indicate a base salary with specified annual increases, and often contain provisions for guaranteed bonuses. Certain of the executives are also
entitled to a separation payment if terminated without “cause” or upon voluntary termination of employment for “good reason” following a “change of control” (as these terms are defined in the employment contracts).

Litigation

The
Company does not have any material litigation as of December 31, 2005.

15.    Segment Information

The Company monitors its operations and evaluates earnings by reviewing the assets and operations of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. Wynn Las Vegas opened
on April 28, 2005. Wynn Macau is currently in the development and construction phase and is expected to open in the third quarter of 2006.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company’s total assets by segment are as follows (in thousands):

F-36

WYNN RESORTS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company’s segment information on its results of operations for each of the years in the
period ended December 31, 2005, is as follows (in thousands):

(1)

Wynn Macau is currently in the development stage and therefore has no revenues or adjusted EBITDA.

(2)

“Adjusted EBITDA” is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses, earnings or
losses from unconsolidated affiliates and other non operating income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a
principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of the

F-37

WYNN RESORTS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

operating performance of its segments—Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau—and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its
competitors. The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company’s ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies
have historically reported EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) financial measures. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone
basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded preopening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses, which do not relate to the management of specific casino properties from their EBITDA calculations.
However, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company’s performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to
any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We compensate
for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA as only one of several comparative tools, together with the common GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such GAAP measurements include operating income (loss), net
income (loss), cash flows from operations and cash flow data. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments and taxes, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. Also,
the Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

16.    Subsequent Events

Avenue Q

In February 2006, the Company entered into an agreement to end the exclusive run of “Avenue Q,” the stage production currently presented in the
Broadway Theater at Wynn Las Vegas. The final performance is expected to be May 28, 2006. In connection with the agreement to end exclusivity, the Company is required to pay to the producers of “Avenue Q” $5.0 million in three
installments. After the run of “Avenue Q” ends, the Company will renovate the Broadway Theater to accommodate the Las Vegas run of “Monty Python’s Spamalot.”

Art Gallery Closure

On
February 19, 2006, the Company closed the art gallery at Wynn Las Vegas.

Amendment to Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities

On March 10, 2006, we amended our Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities to (a) allow the Company to issue up to $100.0
million of senior secured additional notes under the indenture for the First Mortgage Notes; (b) simplify draw procedures under the Disbursement Agreement; (c) consolidate certain accounts under the Disbursement Agreement; (d) amend
and clarify certain of the conditions for the Phase II Approval Date; (e) extend the outside opening date for Encore and the outside completion date for Encore to June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009, respectively; and (f) permit
expenditures of up to $150.0 million on Encore prior to execution of a guaranteed maximum price contract.

Further Expansion of Wynn
Macau

On February 23, 2006, the Company announced its intention to increase the capacity of the second phase of Wynn Macau by an
additional 150 table games, increasing the total table game count in the expansion to 300 tables. The additional cost for further expansion is expected to be approximately $70.0 million, bringing the total project budget to approximately $1.2
billion. It is expected to open concurrently with the last portion of the second phase in the third quarter of 2007. Subject to approval by its secured lenders, the cost of the further expansion can be wholly financed within the existing financing
structure by the application of amounts currently designated as contingent debt. The Company is currently pursuing all necessary approvals from its lenders.

agreed to sell to PBL a subconcession to operate casino games in Macau for a purchase price of $900.0 million. The transaction is subject to the approval of the Macau government.

17.    Financial Statement Restatement

Subsequent to the issuance of the
Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company determined that its interest rate swap arrangements relating to certain of its floating-rate debt facilities did not qualify for hedge accounting
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, and its related interpretations. The Company’s hedge documentation includes, among other items, the assumption that the repricing dates for its debt and swaps match. The
documentation required to assess ineffectiveness resulting from having different repricing dates was not in place at the inception of the hedge, nor during the periods for which an assessment was required, and the Company recently determined that
the repricing dates on the swap instruments did not match exactly the repricing dates on the floating-rate debt. Documentation deficiencies cannot be corrected, and quarterly testing cannot be performed, retrospectively. As a result of the
documentation deficiencies, hedge accounting should not have been used. Accordingly, the Company determined that its 2003 and 2004 interim and annual financial statements and its interim financial statements for the first three quarters of 2005,
should be restated to eliminate the application of hedge accounting. Eliminating the application of cash flow hedge accounting results in recording the mark to market adjustments for the interest rate swaps as interest and other income, net and not
in comprehensive income, as was previously reported.

A summary of the significant effects of the restatement is as follows (amounts in
thousands except per share data):

18.    Consolidating Financial Information of Guarantors and Issuers

The following consolidating financial statements present information related to Wynn Resorts (the “Parent”), which is the issuer of the
Debentures, Wynn Resorts Funding, LLC (the “Convertible Debentures Guarantor”) and non-guarantor subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The following condensed consolidating financial statements are presented in the provided form because: (i) the Convertible Debentures Guarantor is a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent; (ii) the guarantee is considered to be full and unconditional (that is, if the Parent fails to make a scheduled payment, the Convertible Debentures Guarantor is obligated to make the scheduled payment
immediately and, if it does not, any holder of the Debentures may immediately bring suit directly against the Convertible Debentures Guarantor for payment of all amounts due and payable); and (iii) the guarantee is joint and several.

The following (amounts in thousands, except per share data) presents selected interim financial information for 2005, 2004 and 2003, as previously
reported and after giving effect to the restatement (see Note 17). Because loss per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per
share amounts for the four quarters may not equal the total income per share amounts for the year:
