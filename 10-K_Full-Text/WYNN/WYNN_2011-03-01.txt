PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

Wynn Resorts, Limited, a Nevada corporation, was formed in June 2002, is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen A. Wynn, and
is a leading developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. We own and operate two destination casino resorts. In Las Vegas, Nevada, we own and operate “Wynn Las Vegas,” on the “Strip” and “Encore at Wynn Las
Vegas” which is located adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. In the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (“Macau”) we own and operate “Wynn Macau” and “Encore at Wynn Macau.” We present
our results based on the following two segments: Wynn Las Vegas (which includes Encore at Wynn Las Vegas) and Wynn Macau (which includes Encore at Wynn Macau). For more information on the financial results for our segments, see Item 8
“Financial Statements”, Note 17 “Segment Information.”

Unless the context otherwise requires, all
references herein to “Wynn Resorts,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our,” or similar terms, refer to Wynn Resorts, Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Wynn Resorts files annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments of such
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Any document Wynn Resorts files may be inspected, without charge, at the SEC’s public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20549 or at the SEC’s
internet site address at

http://www.sec.gov

. Information related to the operation of the SEC’s public reference room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, through our own internet address at

www.wynnresorts.com

, Wynn Resorts provides a hyperlink to a third-party SEC filing website which posts these filings as soon as reasonably practicable, where they can be reviewed without charge. The information found on our website is not a
part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report we file or furnish to the SEC.

Our Resorts

Wynn Las Vegas

Wynn Las Vegas opened on April 28, 2005. We believe that our resort offers exceptional accommodations, amenities and service with 2,716 rooms and suites, including 36 fairway villas and 6
private-entry villas for our premium guests. For the fifth year in a row, The Tower Suites at Wynn Las Vegas has received both the Forbes five-star and AAA five-diamond distinctions for 2011. The Spa at Wynn Las Vegas earned five-star recognition
from Forbes for the third year in a row. The Spa at Wynn Las Vegas and the Spa at Encore are two of the only three spas in Las Vegas to be recognized with the Forbes five-star award.

The approximately 110,000 square foot casino features 147 table games, a baccarat salon, private VIP gaming rooms, a poker room, 1,842
slot machines, and a race and sports book. The resort’s 22 food and beverage outlets feature five fine dining restaurants, including restaurants helmed by award winning chefs. Wynn Las Vegas also offers two nightclubs, a spa and salon, a
Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership, wedding chapels, an 18-hole golf course, approximately 223,000 square feet of meeting space and an approximately 74,000 square foot retail promenade featuring boutiques from Alexander McQueen, Brioni,
Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Graff, Louis Vuitton, Manolo Blahnik, Oscar de la Renta and Vertu. Wynn Las Vegas also has a showroom which features “Le Rêve,” a water-based theatrical production. We believe that the unique experience of Wynn
Las Vegas drives the significant visitation experienced since opening.

Encore at Wynn Las Vegas

Encore at Wynn Las Vegas opened on December 22, 2008. This resort is located immediately adjacent to and is connected to Wynn Las
Vegas and features a 2,034 all-suite hotel as well as an approximately 76,000 square foot casino with 95 table games, a sky casino, a baccarat salon, private VIP gaming rooms and 778 slot



machines. For the second year in a row, The Encore Tower Suites has received both the Forbes five-star and AAA five-diamond awards for 2011. The Spa at Encore also earned five-star recognition
from Forbes. The resort’s 13 food and beverage outlets include five restaurants, many of which feature award winning chefs. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas also offers a beach club, two nightclubs, a spa and salon, approximately 60,000 square feet of
meeting space and approximately 27,000 square feet of upscale retail outlets featuring boutiques from Hermes, Chanel and others. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas also has a showroom which features Garth Brooks and other headliner entertainment acts.

Wynn Macau

Wynn Macau opened on September 6, 2006. Wynn Macau currently features approximately 595 hotel rooms and suites, 410 table games, 935 slot machines and a poker room in approximately 222,000 square
feet of casino gaming space, including a sky casino, six restaurants, a spa and salon, lounges, meeting facilities and approximately 48,000 square feet of retail space featuring boutiques from Bvlgari, Chanel, Dior, Dunhill, Fendi, Ferrari, Giorgio
Armani, Gucci, Hermes, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu, Piaget, Prada, Rolex, Tiffany, Tudor, Van Cleef & Arpels, Versace, Vertu, Zegna and others. For the third year in a row, Wynn Macau and The Spa at Wynn Macau received the Forbes
five-star distinction. Wynn Macau includes a show in its rotunda featuring a Chinese zodiac-inspired ceiling and interchangeable gold “prosperity tree” and “dragon of fortune” attractions.

Encore at Wynn Macau

Encore at Wynn Macau opened on April 21, 2010. This resort is located immediately adjacent to and is connected with Wynn Macau and features 410 luxury suites and four villas, as well as approximately
34,000 square feet of casino gaming space, including a sky casino, containing 60 table games and 80 slot machines, two restaurants, a luxury spa and additional retail space featuring Chanel, Piaget and Cartier.

See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Results of Operations” for information about our net revenues.

Construction and Development Opportunities

In July 2010, we commenced a project to refurbish and upgrade the rooms and suites at Wynn Las Vegas. The total project
budget is approximately $83 million. The room remodel was completed in January 2011 and the suite remodel is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2011. As a part of this project, we are temporarily removing floors from service at
Wynn Las Vegas which reduces our total number of rooms available during the construction period.

In the ordinary course of
our business, in response to market developments and customer preferences, we have made and continue to make certain enhancements and refinements to our resort complexes.

Approximately 142 acres of land adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas is currently improved with a golf course. While we may develop this property in the future, due to the current
economic environment and certain restrictions in our credit facilities, we have no immediate plans to do so.

We have applied
to the government of Macau for a land concession for approximately 52 acres on Cotai and are awaiting final governmental approval of this concession. No construction timeline or budget has yet been developed.

We continually seek out new opportunities for additional gaming or related businesses, in Las Vegas, other markets in the United States,
and worldwide.



Our Strategy

We believe that Steve Wynn is the preeminent designer, developer and operator of destination casino resorts and has developed brand name status. Mr. Wynn’s involvement with our casino resorts
provides a distinct advantage over other gaming enterprises. We integrate luxurious surroundings, distinctive entertainment and superior amenities, including fine dining and premium retail offerings, to create resorts that appeal to a variety of
customers.

Our resorts were designed and built to provide a premium experience. Wynn Las Vegas, Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,
Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau are positioned as full-service luxury resorts and casinos in the leisure, convention and tour and travel industries. We market these resorts directly to gaming customers using database marketing techniques, as
well as traditional incentives, including reduced room rates and complimentary meals and suites. Our rewards system offers discounted and complimentary meals, lodging and entertainment for our guests. We also create general market awareness for our
resorts through various media channels, including television, radio, newspapers, magazines, the internet, direct mail and billboards.

Mr. Wynn and his team bring significant experience in designing, developing and operating casino resorts. The senior executive team has an average of approximately 25 years of experience in the hotel
and gaming industries. We also have an approximately 90-person design, development and construction subsidiary, the senior management of which has significant experience in all major construction disciplines.

Market and Competition

Las Vegas

Las Vegas is the largest gaming market in the United States. The casino/hotel industry in Las Vegas is highly competitive and, prior to the recent economic conditions and interruption in projects under
development, had undergone a period of exceptional growth, particularly with the addition of projects targeting the premium customer. Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas are located on the Las Vegas Strip and compete with other high-quality
resorts and hotel casinos on the Strip, those in downtown Las Vegas, as well as a large number of hotels in and near Las Vegas. Many competing properties draw a significant number of visitors and directly compete with our operations. We seek to
differentiate Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas from other major Las Vegas resorts by concentrating on our fundamental elements of design, atmosphere, personal service and luxury.

Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas also compete, to some extent, with other hotel/casino facilities in Nevada and Atlantic City,
riverboat gaming facilities in other states, casino facilities on Native American lands, casino resorts throughout Asia, and elsewhere in the world, as well as state lotteries and other forms of gaming. In addition, the legalization of casino gaming
in or near metropolitan areas from which we attract customers could have a negative effect on our business. New or renovated casinos in Asia, including two new resorts in Singapore and our resort in Macau, could draw Asian gaming customers away from
Las Vegas.

Macau

Macau, which was a Portuguese colony for approximately 450 years, was transferred from Portuguese to Chinese political control in December 1999. Macau is governed as a special administrative region of
China and is located approximately 37 miles southwest of, and less than one hour away via ferry from, Hong Kong. Macau, which has been a casino destination for more than 40 years, consists principally of a peninsula on mainland China, and two
neighboring islands, Taipa and Coloane. We believe that Macau is located in one of the world’s largest concentrations of potential gaming customers. According to Macau Statistical Information, casinos in Macau generated approximately $23.5
billion in gaming revenue in 2010, an approximately 58% increase over the approximately $15 billion generated in 2009, making Macau the largest gaming market in the world.



Macau’s gaming market is primarily dependent on tourists. The Macau market has
experienced tremendous growth in capacity in the last few years. As of December 31, 2010, there were 20,091 hotel rooms and 4,791 table games in Macau, compared to 12,978 hotel rooms and 2,762 table games as of December 31, 2006.

Gaming customers traveling to Macau have typically come from nearby destinations in Asia including Hong Kong, mainland China,
Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, approximately 88% of the tourists who visited Macau in 2010 came from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Macau completed
construction of an international airport in 1995, which accommodates large commercial aircraft and provides direct air service to major cities in Asia, including Beijing, Shanghai, Jakarta, Taipei, Manila, Singapore and Bangkok. Travel to Macau by
citizens of mainland China requires a visa. Government officials have, on occasion, exercised their authority to adjust the visa policy and may do so in the future.

Prior to 2002, gaming in Macau was permitted as a government-sanctioned monopoly concession awarded to a single concessionaire. However, the government of Macau liberalized the gaming industry in 2002 by
granting concessions to operate casinos to three concessionaires (including Wynn Macau), who in turn were permitted, subject to the approval of the government of Macau, to each grant one sub-concession to other gaming operators. There is no limit to
the number of casinos each concessionaire is permitted to operate, but each facility is subject to government approval. Currently, there are 33 operating casinos in Macau.

In 2002, the other two concessions were granted to Sociedade de Jogos de Macau (“SJM”) and Galaxy Entertainment Group Limited (“Galaxy”). SJM, which is controlled by the family of
Stanley Ho, operates 20 of the 33 existing casinos, including the Hotel Lisboa and The Grand Lisboa. SJM is a Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed company. In September 2009, SJM opened L’ Arc Macau Casino/Hotel which is adjacent to Wynn Macau. In
December 2009, SJM opened the Casino Oceanus which is adjacent to the Macau ferry terminal. In addition, an affiliate of SJM owns one of three water ferry services and the helicopter shuttle service that links Macau to Hong Kong.

Galaxy, a Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed company, was also awarded a casino concession in June 2002. Galaxy opened the Waldo
Hotel/Casino on the Macau peninsula in 2004, the Grand Waldo Cotai in the summer of 2006, and Galaxy Star World hotel casino immediately adjacent to Wynn Macau in October 2006. In addition, Galaxy is currently constructing a resort on Cotai, which
is expected to open in 2011.

Las Vegas Sands Corp., the owner and operator of The Venetian and The Palazzo resorts in Las
Vegas and a former partner of Galaxy, entered into a sub-concession agreement with Galaxy in 2002 which allows it to independently develop and operate casinos in Macau. The Sands Macao opened in 2004. The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel, the largest
casino resort in Macau, opened in August 2007. In August 2008, an affiliate of Las Vegas Sands Corp. opened the Four Seasons Hotel Macau which includes serviced apartment units, adjacent to the Venetian Macao. In addition, an affiliate of Las Vegas
Sands Corp. has also proposed a masterplan for other large developments in Cotai, some of which are scheduled to open in 2011, that would include additional hotel properties as well as serviced apartment units and additional retail and related
space. In late 2009, Las Vegas Sands Corp. completed the initial public offering of Sands China, Ltd. on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

A joint venture consisting of Melco, a Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed company, and Crown, Ltd., an Australian company, is currently operating the Altira, which opened in May 2007, and the City of Dreams,
a large resort in Cotai, which opened in June 2009. This joint venture operates its properties under a subconcession purchased from us in 2006.

In December 2007, a joint venture of MGM MIRAGE and Pansy Ho Chiu-king (Stanley Ho’s daughter) opened the MGM Grand Macau, a resort on the Macau peninsula adjacent to Wynn Macau. The MGM Grand Macau
is operated pursuant to a subconcession granted to the joint venture by SJM.



Our casino concession agreement allows the government to grant additional concessions for
the operation of casinos commencing April 1, 2009. If the government of Macau awards additional concessions or permits additional sub-concessionaires, Wynn Macau will face increased competition from casino operators in Macau.

Wynn Macau also faces competition from casinos located in other areas of Asia, such as Genting Highlands Resort, a major gaming and
resort destination located outside of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and casinos in Singapore and the Philippines. Wynn Macau also encounters competition from other major gaming centers located around the world, including Australia and Las Vegas, cruise
ships in Asia that offer gaming and other casinos throughout Asia.

Geographic Data

Geographic data are reported in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional financial data about our geographic
operations is provided in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion of Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Regulation and Licensing

The gaming industry is highly regulated. Gaming registrations, licenses and approvals, once obtained, can be suspended or revoked for a
variety of reasons. We cannot assure you that we will obtain all required registrations, licenses and approvals on a timely basis or at all, or that, once obtained, the registrations, findings of suitability, licenses and approvals will not be
suspended, conditioned, limited or revoked. If we are ever prohibited from operating one of our gaming facilities, we would, to the extent permitted by law, seek to recover our investment by selling the property affected, but we cannot assure you
that we could recover full value.

Nevada

Introduction.

The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Nevada are subject to the Nevada
Gaming Control Act and the regulations made under the Act, as well as to various local ordinances. Wynn Las Vegas’ operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission, the Nevada State Gaming Control
Board and the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board, which we refer to herein collectively as the “Nevada Gaming Authorities.”

Policy Concerns of Gaming Laws.

The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy. Such public policy
concerns include, among other things:

•

preventing unsavory or unsuitable persons from being directly or indirectly involved with gaming at any time or in any capacity;

•

establishing and maintaining responsible accounting practices and procedures;

•

maintaining effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and
safeguarding assets and revenue, providing reliable recordkeeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities;

•

preventing cheating and fraudulent practices; and

•

providing a source of state and local revenue through taxation and licensing fees.

Changes in applicable laws, regulations and procedures could have significant negative effects on our Las Vegas gaming operations and our
financial condition and results of operations.

Owner and Operator Licensing Requirements.

Our
subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, as the owner and operator of Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, has been approved by the Nevada Gaming



Authorities as a limited liability company licensee, referred to as a company licensee, which includes approval to conduct casino gaming operations, including a race book and sports pool and
pari-mutuel wagering. These gaming licenses are not transferable.

Company Registration Requirements.

Wynn Resorts was found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Commission to own the equity interests of Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC (“Wynn Resorts Holdings”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, and to be registered by the Nevada Gaming
Commission as a publicly traded corporation, referred to as a registered company, for the purposes of the Nevada Gaming Control Act. Wynn Resorts Holdings was found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Commission to own the equity interests of Wynn Las
Vegas, LLC and to be registered by the Nevada Gaming Commission as an intermediary company. In addition to being licensed, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, as an issuer of First Mortgage Notes registered with the SEC, also qualified as a registered company.
Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp., a co-issuer of the First Mortgage Notes, was not required to be registered or licensed, but may be required to be found suitable as a lender or financing source.

Periodically, we are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Gaming Commission and provide any other
information that the Nevada Gaming Commission may require. Substantially all of our material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must be reported to, and/or approved by, the Nevada Gaming Commission.

Individual Licensing Requirements.

No person may become a stockholder or member of, or receive any percentage of the
profits of, an intermediary company or company licensee without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to or material
involvement with us to determine whether the individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming licensee. Certain of our officers, directors and key employees have been or may be required to file applications with the
Nevada Gaming Authorities and are or may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. All applications required as of the date of this report have been filed. However, the Nevada Gaming Authorities may require
additional applications and may also deny an application for licensing for any reason, which they deem appropriate. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information
followed by a thorough investigation. An applicant for licensing or an applicant for a finding of suitability must pay or must cause to be paid all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming
Authorities and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensing, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have the jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.

If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue
having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the Nevada Gaming Commission may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations
of suitability or questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to judicial review in Nevada.

Redemption of
Securities Owned By an Unsuitable Person.

Wynn Resorts’ articles of incorporation provide that, to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by the board
of directors, Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates. The redemption price will be the amount, if any, required by the gaming authority or, if the gaming authority
does not determine the price, the sum deemed by the board of directors to be the fair value of the securities to be redeemed. If Wynn Resorts determines the redemption price, the redemption price will be capped at the closing price of the shares on
the principal national securities exchange on which the shares are listed on the trading day before the redemption notice is given. If the shares are not listed on a national securities exchange, the redemption price will be capped at the closing
sale price of the shares as quoted on The NASDAQ Global Select Market or if the closing price is not reported, the mean between the bid and asked prices, as quoted by any other generally recognized reporting system. Wynn



Resorts’ right of redemption is not exclusive of any other rights that it may have or later acquire under any agreement, its bylaws or otherwise. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by
promissory note, or both, as required, and pursuant to the terms established by, the applicable Gaming Authority and, if not, as Wynn Resorts elects.

Consequences of Violating Gaming Laws.

If the Nevada Gaming Commission determines that we have violated the Nevada Gaming Control Act or any of its regulations, it could limit, condition,
suspend or revoke our registrations and gaming license. In addition, we and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Gaming Control Act, or of the regulations of the Nevada Gaming
Commission, at the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Further, the Nevada Gaming Commission could appoint a supervisor to operate Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and, under specified circumstances, earnings generated during the
supervisor’s appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the premises) could be forfeited to the State of Nevada. Limitation, conditioning or suspension of any of our gaming licenses and the appointment of a supervisor could, and
revocation of any gaming license would, have a significant negative effect on our gaming operations.

Requirements for
Voting or Nonvoting Securities Holders.

Regardless of the number of shares held, any beneficial owner of Wynn Resorts’ voting or nonvoting securities may be required to file an application, be investigated and have that
person’s suitability as a beneficial owner of voting securities determined if the Nevada Gaming Commission has reason to believe that the ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. If the beneficial owner
of the voting or nonvoting securities of Wynn Resorts who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information including a list of
its beneficial owners. The applicant must pay all costs of the investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any investigation.

The Nevada Gaming Control Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of the voting securities of a registered company to report the acquisition to the Nevada Gaming Commission. The Nevada Gaming
Control Act requires beneficial owners of more than 10% of a registered company’s voting securities to apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board
mails the written notice requiring such filing. However, an “institutional investor,” as defined in the Nevada Gaming Control Act, which beneficially owns more than 10% but not more than 11% of a registered company’s voting securities
as a result of a stock repurchase by the registered company may not be required to file such an application. Further, an institutional investor which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 25%, of a registered company’s voting securities may
apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a waiver of a finding of suitability if the institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may hold more than 25% but
not more than 29% of a registered company’s voting securities and maintain its waiver where the additional ownership results from a stock repurchase by the registered company. An institutional investor will not be deemed to hold voting
securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the
members of the board of directors of the registered company, a change in the corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered company, or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which the Nevada Gaming
Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered company’s voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities which are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include:

•

voting on all matters voted on by stockholders or interest holders;

•

making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a
change in management, policies or operations; and,

•

other activities that the Nevada Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.



The articles of incorporation of Wynn Resorts include provisions intended to assist its
implementation of the above restrictions.

Wynn Resorts is required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada which may be
examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to
make the disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We are required to provide maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner of any of Wynn Resorts’ voting securities. The Nevada Gaming
Commission has the power to require the stock certificates of any registered company to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act. The certificates representing shares of Wynn Resorts’ common
stock note that the shares are subject to a right of redemption and other restrictions set forth in Wynn Resorts’ articles of incorporation and bylaws and that the shares are, or may become, subject to restrictions imposed by applicable gaming
laws.

Consequences of Being Found Unsuitable.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of
suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Gaming Commission or by the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada
Gaming Authorities in connection with the investigation of its application, may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any person found
unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of any voting security or debt security of a registered company beyond the period of time as may be prescribed by the Nevada Gaming Commission may be guilty of a criminal
offense. We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to hold an equity interest or to have any other relationship with us, we:

•

pay that person any dividend or interest upon any voting securities;

•

allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right held by that person relating to Wynn Resorts;

•

pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or,

•

fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to relinquish such person’s voting securities including, if necessary, the
immediate purchase of the voting securities for cash at fair market value.

Gaming Laws Relating to
Debt Securities Ownership.

The Nevada Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require the owner of any debt or similar securities of a registered company, to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt or other
security of the registered company if the Nevada Gaming Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. If the Nevada Gaming Commission decides that a person is
unsuitable to own the security, then under the Nevada Gaming Control Act, the registered company can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission, it:

•

pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest or any distribution whatsoever;

•

recognizes any voting right by the unsuitable person in connection with the securities;

•

pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or,

•

makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction.

Approval of Public Offerings.

We may not make a public offering without the prior approval of
the Nevada Gaming Commission if the proceeds from the offering are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes or for similar



transactions. On March 19, 2009, the Nevada Gaming Commission granted us and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC prior approval, subject to certain conditions, to make public offerings for a period of two
years (the “Shelf Approval”). The Shelf Approval also applies to any affiliated company wholly owned by us which is a publicly traded corporation or would thereby become a publicly traded corporation pursuant to a public offering. The
Shelf Approval may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board. The Shelf Approval does not constitute a finding, recommendation or
approval by any of the Nevada Gaming Authorities as to the accuracy or adequacy of the offering memorandum or the investment merits of the securities. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.

Approval of Changes in Control.

A registered company must obtain the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission
with respect to a change in control through merger; consolidation; stock or asset acquisitions; management or consulting agreements; or any act or conduct by a person by which the person obtains control of the registered company.

Entities seeking to acquire control of a registered company must satisfy the Nevada State Gaming Control Board and Nevada Gaming
Commission with respect to a variety of stringent standards before assuming control of the registered company. The Nevada Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material
relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.

Approval of Defensive Tactics.

The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense
tactics affecting Nevada corporate gaming licensees or affecting registered companies that are affiliated with the operations of Nevada gaming licensees may be harmful to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Nevada Gaming Commission has
established a regulatory scheme to reduce the potential adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada’s gaming industry and to further Nevada’s policy in order to:

•

assure the financial stability of corporate gaming licensees and their affiliated companies;

•

preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and,

•

promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

Approvals may be required from the Nevada Gaming Commission before a registered company can make exceptional repurchases of voting
securities above its current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Nevada Gaming Control Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by a registered company’s
board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to its stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control.

Fees and Taxes.

License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are
payable to the State of Nevada and to the counties and cities in which the licensed subsidiaries’ respective operations are conducted. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable monthly, quarterly or
annually and are based upon:

•

a percentage of the gross revenue received;

•

the number of gaming devices operated; or,

•

the number of table games operated.

A live entertainment tax also is imposed on admission charges and sales of food, beverages and merchandise where live entertainment is furnished.

Foreign Gaming Investigations.

Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered
in Nevada, or is under common control with such persons (collectively, “licensees”), and who



proposes to become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada, is required to deposit with the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of
$10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board of the licensee’s or registrant’s participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the
Nevada Gaming Commission. Licensees and registrants are required to comply with the foreign gaming reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Gaming Control Act. A licensee or registrant is also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Gaming
Commission if it:

•

knowingly violates any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation;

•

fails to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;

•

engages in any activity or enters into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada,
reflects or tends to reflect, discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada;

•

engages in activities or enters into associations that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees; or,

•

employs, contracts with or associates with a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or finding of suitability in Nevada on the
ground of unsuitability.

Licenses for Conduct of Gaming and Sale of Alcoholic Beverages.

The
conduct of gaming activities and the service and sale of alcoholic beverages at Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas are subject to licensing, control and regulation by the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board, which has granted
Wynn Las Vegas, LLC licenses for such purposes. In addition to approving Wynn Las Vegas, LLC the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board has the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of any corporation controlling a
gaming license. Clark County gaming and liquor licenses are not transferable. The County has full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license. Any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a substantial negative impact upon
our operations.

Macau

General.

As a casino concessionaire, Wynn Macau, S.A. is subject to the regulatory control of the Government of Macau. The government has adopted Laws and Administrative Regulations
governing the operation of casinos in Macau. Only concessionaires or subconcessionaires are permitted to operate casinos. Subconcessions may be awarded subject to the approval of the Macau government and, each concessionaire has issued one
subconcession. Each concessionaire was required to enter into a concession agreement with the Macau government which, together with the Laws and Administrative Regulations, forms the framework for the regulation of the activities of the
concessionaire.

Under the Laws and Administrative Regulations, concessionaires are subject to suitability requirements
relating to background, associations and reputation, as are stockholders of 5% or more of a concessionaire’s equity securities, officers, directors and key employees. The same requirements apply to any entity engaged by a concessionaire to
manage casino operations. Concessionaires are required to satisfy minimum capitalization requirements, demonstrate and maintain adequate financial capacity to operate the concession and submit to continuous monitoring of their casino operations by
the Macau government. Concessionaires also are subject to periodic financial reporting requirements and reporting obligations with respect to, among other things, certain contracts, financing activities and transactions with directors, financiers
and key employees. Transfers or the encumbering of interests in concessionaires must be reported to the Macau government and are ineffective without government approval.



Each concessionaire is required to engage an executive director who must be a permanent
resident of Macau and the holder of at least 10% of the capital stock of the concessionaire. The appointment of the executive director and of any successor is ineffective without the approval of the Macau government. All contracts placing the
management of a concessionaire’s casino operations with a third party also are ineffective without the approval of the Macau government.

Concessionaires are subject to a special gaming tax of 35% of gross gaming revenue, and must also make an annual contribution of up to 4% of gross gaming revenue for the promotion of public interests,
social security, infrastructure and tourism. Concessionaires are obligated to withhold, according to the rate in effect as set by the government, from any commissions paid to games promoters. Such withholding rate may be adjusted from time to time.

A games promoter, also known as a junket representative, is a person who, for the purpose of promoting casino gaming
activity, arranges customer transportation and accommodations, and provides credit in their sole discretion, food and beverage services and entertainment in exchange for commissions or other compensation from a concessionaire. Macau law provides
that games promoters must be licensed by the Macau government in order to do business with and receive compensation from concessionaires. For a license to be obtained, direct and indirect owners of 5% or more of a games promoter (regardless of its
corporate form or sole proprietor status), its directors and its key employees must be found suitable. Applicants are required to pay the cost of license investigations, and are required to maintain suitability standards during the period of
licensure. The term of a games promoters license is one calendar year, and licenses can be renewed for additional periods upon the submission of renewal applications. Natural person junket representative licensees are subject to a suitability
verification process every three years and business entity licensees are subject to the same requirement every six years. The DICJ has recently implemented certain instructions, which have the force of law, relating to commissions paid to and by
games promoters. Such instructions also impose certain financial reporting and audit requirements on games promoters.

Under
Macau law, licensed games promoters must identify outside contractors who assist them in their promotion activities. These contractors are subject to approval of the Macau government. Changes in the management structure of business entity games
promoters licensees must be reported to the Macau government and any transfer or the encumbering of interests in such licensees is ineffective without prior government approval. To conduct gaming promotion activities licensees must be registered
with one or more concessionaires and must have written contracts with such concessionaires, copies of which must be submitted to the Macau government.

Macau law further provides that concessionaires are jointly responsible with their games promoters for the activities of such representatives and their directors and contractors in the
concessionaires’ casinos, and for their compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Concessionaires must submit annual lists of their games promoters for the following year, and must update such lists on a quarterly basis. The Macau
government may designate a maximum number of games promoters and specify the number of games promoters a concessionaire is permitted to engage. Concessionaires are subject to periodic reporting requirements with respect to commissions paid to their
games promoters representatives and are required to oversee their activities and report instances of unlawful activity.

The
government of Macau may assume temporary custody and control over the operation of a concession in certain circumstances. During any such period, the costs of operations must be borne by the concessionaire. The government of Macau also may redeem a
concession starting at an established date after the entering into effect of a concession. The government of Macau also may terminate a concession for cause, including, without limitation, failure of the concessionaire to fulfill its obligations
under law or the concession contract.

Concession Agreement.

The concession agreement between Wynn Macau S.A.
and the Macau government required Wynn Macau, S.A. to construct and operate one or more casino gaming properties in Macau, including,



at a minimum, one full-service casino resort by the end of December 2006, and to invest not less than a total of 4 billion patacas (approximately US$500 million) in Macau-related projects by June
2009. This obligation was satisfied upon the opening of Wynn Macau in 2006.

Wynn Macau, S.A. was also obligated to obtain,
and did obtain, a 700 million pataca (approximately US$87 million) bank guarantee from Banco National Ultramarino, S.A. (“BNU”) that was effective until March 31, 2007. The amount of this guarantee was reduced to
300 million patacas (approximately US$37 million) for the period from April 1, 2007 until 180 days after the end of the term of the concession agreement. This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures
Wynn Macau, S.A.’s performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform the concession agreement. Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated, upon demand by BNU, to
promptly repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. BNU is currently paid an annual fee by Wynn Macau, S.A. for the guarantee not to exceed 5.2 million patacas (approximately US$0.7 million).

The government of Macau may redeem the concession beginning on June 24, 2017, and in such event Wynn Macau, S.A. will be entitled to
fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption multiplied for the remaining years under the concession.

The government of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession if Wynn Macau, S.A. fails to fulfill its fundamental obligations under
the concession agreement. The concession agreement expressly provides that the government of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession agreement if Wynn Macau, S.A.:

•

conducts unauthorized games or activities that are excluded from its corporate purpose;

•

abandons or suspends gaming operations in Macau for more than seven consecutive days (or more than 14 days in a civil year) without justification;

•

defaults in payment of taxes, premiums, contributions or other required amounts;

•

does not comply with government inspections or supervision;

•

systematically fails to observe its obligations under the concession system;

•

fails to maintain bank guarantees or bonds satisfactory to the government;

•

is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or becomes insolvent;

•

engages in serious fraudulent activity, damaging to the public interest; or,

•

repeatedly and seriously violates applicable gaming laws.

If the government of Macau unilaterally rescinds the concession agreement for one of the reasons stated above, Wynn Macau, S.A. will be required to compensate the government in accordance with applicable
law, and the areas defined as casino under Macau law and all of the gaming equipment pertaining to the gaming operations of Wynn Macau will be transferred to the government without compensation. In addition, the government of Macau may, in the
public interest, unilaterally terminate the concession at any time, in which case Wynn Macau, S.A. would be entitled to reasonable compensation.

Seasonality

We may experience fluctuations in revenues and cash flows from
month to month, however, we do not believe that our business is materially impacted by seasonality.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we had a total of 16,405 full-time equivalent employees (including 9,405 in Las Vegas and 7,000 in Macau).



During 2006, we entered into a ten year collective bargaining agreement with the Culinary
and Bartenders Union local that covers approximately 5,600 employees at Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. We also entered into a ten year collective bargaining agreement with the Transportation Workers Union in November 2010, which covers
the table games dealers at Wynn Las Vegas. Certain other unions may seek to organize the workers at Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. Unionization, pressure to unionize or other forms of collective bargaining could increase our labor
costs.

The success of our operations in Macau will be affected by our success in retaining our employees. Wynn Macau and
Encore at Wynn Macau compete with the large number of casino resort developments in Macau for limited qualified employees. We seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our Macau resorts and policies announced publicly by the Macau
government have affected our ability to import labor in certain job classifications. We are coordinating with the Macau labor and immigration authorities to ensure our labor demand is satisfied, but cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit
and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees for our Macau operations or that we will be able to obtain required work permits for those employees.

Intellectual Property

Among our most important marks are our trademarks
and service marks that use the name “WYNN.” Wynn Resorts has filed applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) to register a variety of the WYNN-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety
of goods and services. These marks include “WYNN RESORTS,” “WYNN DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT,” “WYNN LAS VEGAS,” “ENCORE” and “WYNN MACAU.” Some of the applications are based upon ongoing use and others
are based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks.

A common element of most of these marks is the use of the surname,
“WYNN.” As a general rule, a surname (or the portion of a mark primarily constituting a surname) is not eligible for registration unless the surname has acquired “secondary meaning.” To date, Wynn Resorts has been successful in
demonstrating to the PTO such secondary meaning for the Wynn name in certain of the applications based upon factors including Mr. Wynn’s prominence as a resort developer.

Federal registrations are not completely dispositive of the right to such marks. Third parties who claim prior rights with respect to
similar marks may nonetheless challenge our right to obtain registrations or our use of the marks and seek to overcome the presumptions afforded by such registrations.

We have also filed applications with various foreign patent and trademark registries, including in Macau, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, certain European countries and various other
jurisdictions throughout the world to register a variety of WYNN-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. These marks include many of the same marks filed with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office and include “WYNN MACAU,” “WYNN LAS VEGAS” and “ENCORE.” Some of the applications are based upon ongoing use and others are based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks.

We recognize that our intellectual property assets, including the word and logo version of “WYNN,” are among our most valuable
assets. As a result, and in connection with expansion of our resorts and gaming activities outside the United States, we have undertaken a program to register our trademarks and other intellectual property rights in relevant jurisdictions. We have
retained counsel and intend to take all steps necessary to protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized use throughout the world.

On August 6, 2004, we entered into agreements with Mr. Wynn that confirm and clarify our rights to use the “Wynn” name and Mr. Wynn’s persona in connection with our casino
resorts. Under a Surname Rights Agreement, Mr. Wynn has acknowledged our exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual, worldwide right to use, and to own and register trademarks and service marks incorporating, the “Wynn” name for casino
resorts and related businesses, together with the right to sublicense the name and marks to our affiliates. Under a Rights of Publicity License, Mr. Wynn has granted us the exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right to use his full name, persona
and related rights of publicity for casino resorts and related businesses, together with the ability to sublicense the persona and publicity rights to our affiliates, until October 24, 2017.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The
following risk factors, among others, could cause our financial performance to differ significantly from the goals, plans, objectives, intentions and expectations expressed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks and
uncertainties or other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or not currently considered to be material actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed substantially.

Risks Related to our Substantial Indebtedness

We are highly leveraged and future cash flow may not be sufficient for us to meet our obligations, and we might have difficulty obtaining more financing.

We have a substantial amount of consolidated debt in relation to our equity. As of December 31, 2010, we had total outstanding debt
of approximately $3.3 billion. In addition, our Wynn Las Vegas credit agreement permits us to incur additional indebtedness in the future and the Wynn Macau credit facilities permit us to incur additional indebtedness if certain conditions are met.
Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example:

•

if we fail to meet our payment obligations or otherwise default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, the lenders under those agreements
will have the right to accelerate the indebtedness and exercise other rights and remedies against us. These rights and remedies include rights to:

•

repossess and foreclose upon the assets that serve as collateral;

•

initiate judicial foreclosure against us; and

•

petition a court to appoint a receiver for us or for substantially all of our assets.

•

we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas to service and
amortize our Wynn Las Vegas indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of available cash, if any, to fund working capital, other capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, and may give us greater exposure to the current adverse
economic and industry conditions;

•

we may experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and high unemployment due to the adverse
economic and industry conditions, and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs and/or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject to under our existing indebtedness. We cannot
provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs;

•

we are dependent on certain amounts of cash flow from Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau to service Wynn Macau’s indebtedness, which reduces the
available cash flow to fund working capital, other capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes at Wynn Macau;

•

we may have a limited ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to withstand competitive pressures, which may affect our
financial condition;

•

we may not be able to obtain additional financing, if needed, to satisfy working capital requirements or pay for other capital expenditures, debt
service or other obligations;

•

while we do hedge a certain amount of our debt under our credit facilities, rates with respect to a portion of the interest we pay will fluctuate with
market rates and, accordingly, our interest expense will increase if market interest rates increase; and

•

if we fail to pay our debts generally as they become due, unsecured creditors that we fail to pay may initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings
against us, subject to the requirements of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and such bankruptcy proceedings will delay or impact the repayment of our secured debt.



Under the terms of the documents governing our debt facilities, we may, subject to certain
limitations, be permitted to incur additional indebtedness, including secured senior and subordinated indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above will be exacerbated.

The agreements governing our debt facilities contain certain financial covenants and other covenants that restrict our ability to
engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.

Our
debt facilities require us to satisfy various financial covenants, which include requirements for minimum interest coverage ratios (currently required for both Wynn Macau and Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities) and leverage ratios pertaining to total
debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (currently required for our Wynn Macau credit facility). If our operations fail to generate adequate cash flow, we may violate those covenants causing a default in our agreements.
Future indebtedness or other contracts could contain covenants more restrictive than those contained in our existing debt facilities.

Our ability to comply with the terms of our outstanding facilities may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions and other events, some of which may be beyond our control. As a
result, we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants. Our failure to comply with the terms of our debt facilities, including failure as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which would
materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition or result in our lenders taking action to enforce their security interests in our various assets.

The agreements governing our debt facilities also contain restrictions on our ability to engage in certain transactions and may limit our
ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. The debt facilities impose operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries, including, among other things, limitations on the ability to:

•

pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity;

•

incur additional debt;

•

make investments;

•

create liens on assets to secure debt;

•

enter into transactions with affiliates;

•

issue stock of, or member’s interests in, subsidiaries;

•

enter into sale-leaseback transactions;

•

engage in other businesses;

•

merge or consolidate with another company;

•

transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets;

•

issue disqualified stock;

•

create dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; and

•

designate restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries.

If there were an event of default under one of our debt instruments, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We
cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, or that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on
those debt securities.



If Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to
service its indebtedness or otherwise become unable to make certain payments or dividends to us which we in turn could use to service our indebtedness, our ability to service the indebtedness of Wynn Macau or Wynn Las Vegas, LLC could be negatively
impacted.

Our subsidiaries’ indebtedness is secured by a substantial portion of their assets.

Subject to applicable laws, including gaming laws, and certain agreed upon exceptions, our subsidiaries’ debt is secured by liens on
substantially all of the assets of our subsidiaries. In the event of a default by any of our subsidiaries under their financing documents, or if certain of our subsidiaries experience insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the
holders of our subsidiaries’ secured debt instruments would first be entitled to payment from their collateral security, and only then would holders of our subsidiaries’ unsecured debt be entitled to payment from their remaining assets.

Risks Related to our Business

The loss of Stephen A. Wynn could significantly harm our business.

Our ability to maintain our competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts, skills and reputation of Stephen A. Wynn,
the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and one of the principal stockholders of Wynn Resorts. Mr. Wynn’s employment agreement expires in October 2020. However, we cannot assure you that Mr. Wynn will remain with Wynn
Resorts, Limited. If we lose the services of Mr. Wynn, or if he is unable to devote sufficient attention to our operations for any other reason, our business may be significantly impaired.

Continued weakness in the United States economic conditions may adversely affect consumer and corporate spending and tourism
trends, resulting in additional deterioration in our business.

Discretionary consumer spending has been adversely
affected by continued economic weakness in the U.S. Consumers are traveling less and spending less when they do travel. Likewise, corporate spending on conventions and business development is being significantly curtailed as businesses cut their
budgets. Since our business model relies on significant expenditure on luxury and discretionary items, continuation or deepening of the crisis will further adversely affect our operations.

There may be excess room supply particularly in the luxury segment in Las Vegas.

There have been large additions to the room supply in Las Vegas since December 2009. Even after the economy begins to recover, there may
be excess supply, particularly in the luxury segment.

We are entirely dependent on a limited number of resorts for all
of our cash flow, which subjects us to greater risks than a gaming company with more operating properties.

We are
entirely dependent upon our resorts in Las Vegas and Macau for all of our cash flow. As a result, we are subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company with more operating properties. The risks to which we have a greater degree of
exposure include the following:

•

local economic and competitive conditions;

•

changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations;

•

natural and other disasters;

•

a decline in the number of visitors to Las Vegas or Macau;



•

a decrease in gaming and non-gaming activities at our resorts ; and

•

the outbreak of an infectious disease such as H1N1 or the avian flu.

Any of the factors outlined above could negatively affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments or maintain our
covenants with respect to our debt.

Our casino, hotel, convention and other facilities face intense competition.

Competition for Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas

.

The casino/hotel industry is highly
competitive and additional developments have recently opened in Las Vegas. Resorts located on or near the Las Vegas Strip compete with other Las Vegas Strip hotels and with other hotel casinos in Las Vegas on the basis of overall atmosphere, range
of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment, theme and size, among other factors.

Wynn Las Vegas and
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas also compete with other hotel/casino facilities in other cities, riverboat gaming facilities in other states, casino facilities on Native American lands and elsewhere in the world, state lotteries and other forms of gaming.
The proliferation of gaming activities in other areas could significantly harm our business as well. In particular, the legalization or expansion of casino gaming in or near metropolitan areas from which we attract customers could have a negative
effect on our business. In addition, new or renovated casinos in Macau or elsewhere in Asia could draw Asian gaming customers away from Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.

Competition for Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau

. Currently there are 33 operating casinos in Macau. We hold a
concession under one of only three gaming concessions and three sub-concessions authorized by the Macau government to operate casinos in Macau. The Macau government has had the ability to grant additional gaming concessions since April 2009. If the
Macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in Macau through the grant of additional concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations.

Our Macau resort complex also faces competition from casinos located in other areas of Asia, such as
Genting Highlands Resort, a major gaming and resort destination located outside of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and casinos in Singapore and the Philippines. We also encounter competition from other major gaming centers located around the world,
including Australia and Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout Asia. Further, if current efforts to legalize gaming in other Asian countries are successful, our Wynn Macau resort will face additional regional
competition.

Our business relies on high-end, international customers. We often extend credit, and we may not be able
to collect gaming receivables from our credit players or credit play may decrease.

General.

A
significant portion of our table games revenue at our resorts is attributable to the play of a limited number of international customers. The loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these customers could have a substantial
negative effect on our future operating results. A downturn in economic conditions in the countries in which these customers reside could cause a further reduction in the frequency of visits by and revenue generated from these customers.

We conduct our gaming activities on a credit as well as a cash basis. This credit is unsecured. Table games players typically are
extended more credit than slot players, and high-stakes players typically are extended more credit than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. The collectability of receivables from international customers could be negatively affected by future
business or economic trends or by significant events in the countries in which these customers reside. We will extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources, in the opinion of management, warrant such an extension.



In addition, high-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in
win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter.

Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.

While gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a “marker,” are enforceable under the
current laws of Nevada, and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states of the United States under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that direct or indirect enforcement
of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the United States of foreign debtors may be used to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts
are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to collect the full amount of gaming debts owed to us, even in jurisdictions that enforce them. Recent dramatic changes in economic conditions may make
it more difficult to assess creditworthiness and more difficult to collect the full amount of any gaming debt owed to us. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.

Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau.

Although the law in Macau permits casino operators to extend credit to gaming
customers, Wynn Macau may not be able to collect all of its gaming receivables from its credit players. We expect that Wynn Macau will be able to enforce these obligations only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To the extent our
gaming customers are visitors from other jurisdictions, we may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and we
may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.

Currently, the gaming tax in Macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue. However, unlike Nevada, the gross gaming revenue calculation in Macau does not include deductions for
uncollectible gaming debts. As a result, if we extend credit to our customers in Macau and are unable to collect on the related receivables from them, we remain obligated to pay taxes on our winnings from these customers.

Our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer and corporate spending as a result of downturns in
the economy.

Consumer demand for hotel/casino resorts, trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury
amenities that we offer is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy which adversely impact discretionary spending on leisure activities. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as
perceived or actual general economic conditions, high unemployment, the housing foreclosure crisis, perceived or actual changes in disposable consumer income and wealth, the economic recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy, or
fears of war and future acts of terrorism could reduce customer demand for the luxury amenities and leisure activities we offer, and may have a significant negative impact on our operating results.

We are subject to extensive state and local regulation, and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our
operations, which could have a negative effect on our business.

General.

The operations of our resorts
are contingent upon our obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses, permits, approvals, registrations, findings of suitability, orders and authorizations. The laws, regulations and ordinances requiring these licenses, permits and other
approvals generally relate to the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations, as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. The scope of the approvals required to
open and operate a facility is extensive. We received all approvals for the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005, and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas on December 22, 2008. We are subject to ongoing regulation to maintain their operations.
We opened Wynn Macau on September 6, 2006 and Encore at Wynn Macau on April 21, 2010, and are subject to ongoing regulation to maintain their operations.



Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.

The Nevada Gaming Commission may,
in its discretion, require the holder of any debt or securities we issue to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own Wynn Resorts’ securities if it has reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent
with the declared policies of the State of Nevada.

Nevada regulatory authorities have broad powers to request detailed
financial and other information, to limit, condition, suspend or revoke a registration, gaming license or related approval and to approve changes in our operations. Substantial fines or forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming laws or
regulations may be levied. The suspension or revocation of any license which may be granted to us or the levy of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, compliance costs associated with gaming laws, regulations and licenses are significant. Any change in the laws, regulations or licenses applicable to our business or a violation of any current or future laws or regulations applicable to
our business or gaming licenses could require us to make substantial expenditures or could otherwise negatively affect our gaming operations.

Wynn Resorts’ articles of incorporation provide that, to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by the board of directors,
Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note, or both, as required, and pursuant to the terms established by,
the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as Wynn Resorts elects.

Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau.

Wynn
Macau’s operations are subject to unique risks, including risks related to Macau’s regulatory framework. In Macau, we have developed certain operating procedures which are different from those used in United States casinos. Failure to
adhere to the regulatory and gaming environment in Macau could result in the revocation of Wynn Macau, S.A.’s concession or otherwise negatively affect its operations in Macau. Moreover, we would be subject to the risk that U.S. regulators
could determine that Macau’s gaming regulatory framework has not developed in a way that would permit us to conduct operations in Macau in a manner consistent with the way in which we intend, or the Nevada gaming authorities require us, to
conduct our operations in the United States.

We are subject to taxation by various governments and agencies. The rate
of taxation could change.

We are subject to tax by various governments and agencies, both in the United States (at the
federal, state and local levels) and in Macau. Various legislative actions or the failure to renew our agreement with the Macau government with respect to dividends could change the rates of taxation or the company’s ability to claim foreign
tax credits.

If enacted into law, certain provisions of the Administration’s 2012 Budget Proposal could impact the
Company’s ability to claim U.S. foreign tax credits for Macau gaming taxes paid after 2011. Increases in taxation could adversely affect our results.

Terrorism and the uncertainty of military conflicts, natural disasters and contagious diseases, as well as other factors affecting discretionary consumer spending, may harm our operating results.

The strength and profitability of our business depends on consumer demand for hotel casino resorts in general and for
the type of luxury amenities our resorts offer. Changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could harm our business. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, other terrorist activities in the United States and
elsewhere, military conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and in the Middle East, outbreaks of infectious disease and pandemics, and natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis and earthquakes, among other things, have had negative impacts on travel and
leisure expenditures. We cannot predict the extent to which similar events and conditions may continue to affect us in the future. An extended period of reduced



discretionary spending and/or disruptions or declines in airline travel and business conventions could significantly harm our operations. In particular, because our business relies heavily upon
high-end customers, particularly international customers, factors resulting in a decreased propensity to travel internationally could have a negative impact on our operations.

In addition, other factors affecting travel and discretionary consumer spending, including general economic conditions, disposable consumer income, high unemployment, and reduced consumer confidence in
the economy, may negatively impact our business. Negative changes in any factors affecting discretionary spending could reduce customer demand for the products and services we offer, thus imposing practical limits on pricing and harming our
operations.

Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our
insurance costs may increase.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 have substantially affected the
availability of insurance coverage for certain types of damages or occurrences. We currently have insurance coverage for terrorist acts included in our commercial property insurance policy with respect to Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,
not to exceed $1.5 billion. Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau have separate terrorist insurance coverage for up to $800 million per occurrence for losses that could result from these acts. However, these types of acts could expose us to
losses that exceed our coverage and could have a significant negative impact on our operations.

We may not have sufficient
insurance coverage in the event of a catastrophic property or casualty loss. We may also suffer disruption of our business in the event of a terrorist attack or other catastrophic property or casualty loss or be subject to claims by third parties
injured or harmed. While we currently carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in such event. In the event that insurance premiums increase, we may not be able
to maintain the insurance coverage we currently have or otherwise be able to maintain adequate insurance protection.

If
a third party successfully challenges our ownership of, or right to use, the Wynn-related service marks, our business or results of operations could be harmed.

We have filed applications with the PTO and with various foreign patent and trademark registries including registries in Macau, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, certain European countries and
various other jurisdictions throughout the world, to register a variety of WYNN-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. These marks include “WYNN RESORTS,” “WYNN DESIGN AND
DEVELOPMENT,” “WYNN LAS VEGAS,” “ENCORE” and “WYNN MACAU.” Some of the applications are based upon ongoing use and others are based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks in the future.

A common element of most of these marks is the use of the surname “WYNN.” As a general rule, a surname (or the portion of a
mark primarily constituting a surname) is not eligible for registration unless the surname has acquired “secondary meaning.” To date, we have been successful in demonstrating to the PTO such secondary meaning for the Wynn name, in certain
of the applications, based upon factors including Mr. Wynn’s prominence as a resort developer, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful with the other pending applications.

Even if we are able to obtain registration of the WYNN-related marks, such federal registrations are not completely dispositive of the
right to such marks. Third parties who claim prior rights with respect to similar marks may nonetheless challenge our right to obtain registrations or our use of the marks and seek to overcome the presumptions afforded by such registrations.



Our intellectual property assets, especially the logo version of “Wynn,” are among
our most valuable assets. Efforts we take to acquire and protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized use throughout the world which may include retaining counsel and commencing litigation in various jurisdictions may be costly and
may not be successful in protecting and preserving the status and value of our intellectual property assets.

If a third
party asserts other forms of intellectual property claims against us, our business or results of operations could be adversely affected.

Historically, trademarks and service marks have been the principal form of intellectual property right of relevance to the gaming industry. However, due to the increased use of technology in computerized
gaming machines and in business operations generally, other forms of intellectual property rights (such as patents and copyrights) are becoming of increased relevance. It is possible that, in the future, third parties might assert superior
intellectual property rights or allege that their intellectual property rights cover some aspect of our operations. The defense of such allegations may result in substantial expenses, and, if such claims are successfully prosecuted, may have a
material impact on our business.

Our largest stockholders are able to exert significant control over our operations and
future direction.

Mr. Wynn, Elaine P. Wynn, and Aruze USA, Inc., together own approximately 35.6%, of our
outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. Wynn, Elaine P. Wynn, and Aruze USA, Inc., to the extent they vote their shares in a similar manner, may be able to exert significant control over all matters requiring our stockholders’ approval,
including the approval of significant corporate transactions.

In November 2006, Mr. Wynn, and Aruze USA, Inc., entered
into a stockholders’ agreement. On January 6, 2010, the agreement was amended and restated to, among other things, recognize Mr. Wynn’s transfer of 11,076,709 shares to Elaine P. Wynn. Pursuant to the amended and restated
stockholders agreement, Elaine P. Wynn became party to the agreement in connection with her ownership of 11,076,709 shares of the Company’s common stock. Under the amended and restated stockholders’ agreement, Mr. Wynn, Elaine P.
Wynn, and Aruze USA, Inc., have agreed to vote their shares of our common stock for a slate of directors supported by Mr. Wynn. As a result of this voting arrangement, Mr. Wynn, as a practical matter, controls the slate of directors to be
elected to our board of directors. In addition, with stated exceptions, the agreement requires the written consent of the other parties prior to any party selling any shares of Wynn Resorts that it owns.

In November 2006, the Board of Wynn Resorts approved an amendment of its bylaws that exempts future acquisitions of shares of Wynn
Resorts’ common stock by either Mr. Wynn or Aruze USA, Inc. from Nevada’s acquisition of controlling interest statutes. The Nevada acquisition of controlling interest statutes require stockholder approval in order to exercise voting
rights in connection with any acquisition of a controlling interest in certain Nevada corporations unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation in effect on the 10th day following the acquisition of a controlling interest by
certain acquiring persons provide that these statutes do not apply to the corporation or to the acquisition specifically by types of existing or future stockholders. These statutes define a “controlling interest” as (i) one-fifth or
more but less than one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more, of the voting power in the election of directors. As a result of the bylaw amendment, either Mr. Wynn or Aruze USA, Inc. or
their respective affiliates may acquire ownership of outstanding voting shares of Wynn Resorts permitting them to exercise more than one-third but less than a majority, or a majority or more, of all of the voting power of the corporation in the
election of directors, without requiring a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation granting voting rights in the control shares acquired.

Because we own real property, we are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.

We have incurred costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to discharges into the air, water and land, the
handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties



affected by hazardous substances. Under these and other environmental requirements we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at our
property. As an owner or operator, we could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination.

These laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or
caused the presence of the contaminants. The liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. The costs of investigation,
remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use our property.

Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or applicable Anti-Money Laundering Regulation could have a negative impact on
us.

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes the
Company to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing business cross-border and in each of the countries in which it transacts business. We are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”)
and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA.
Internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing
our policies and the law. If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or Company policies governing our international operations, the Company may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which
could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and
regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering
regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our resorts could have a negative effect on our results of operations.

Risks Associated with Wynn Macau

Revenues from our Macau gaming
operations will end if we cannot secure an extension of our concession in 2022 or if the Macau government exercises its redemption right in 2017.

Our concession agreement expires in June 2022. Unless our concession is extended, in June 2022, all of our gaming operations and related equipment located in defined areas of our casino in Macau will be
automatically transferred to the Macau government without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from these operations. Beginning in June 2017, the Macau government may redeem the concession agreement by providing us at least
one year’s prior notice. In the event the Macau government exercises this redemption right, we are entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue
generated during the tax year prior to the redemption multiplied for the remaining years under the concession. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew or extend our concession agreement on terms favorable to us or at all. We also cannot
assure you that if our concession is redeemed, the compensation paid will be adequate to compensate us for the loss of future revenues.



Visitation to Macau may decline due to economic disruptions in mainland China as well
as increased restrictions on visitations to Macau from citizens of mainland China.

A significant number of our gaming
customers at Wynn Macau come from mainland China. Any economic disruption in China could disrupt the number of patrons visiting our property or the amount they may be willing to spend. In addition, any travel restrictions imposed by China could
disrupt the number of visitors from mainland China to our property. It is not known when, or if, policies similar to those implemented in 2009 restricting visitation by mainland Chinese citizens to Macau and Hong Kong, will be put in place and visa
policies may be adjusted, without notice, in the future.

We compete for limited labor resources in Macau and Macau
government policies may also affect our ability to employ imported labor.

The success of our operations in Macau will
be affected by our success in retaining our employees. We compete with a large number of casino resorts in Macau for a limited number of qualified employees. We have to seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resort and policies
announced by the Macau government have affected our ability to import labor in certain job classifications. We coordinate with the Macau labor and immigration authorities to ensure our labor demand is satisfied, but cannot be certain that we will be
able to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees for our operations or that we will be able to obtain required work permits for those employees.

We depend upon games promoters for a significant portion of our gaming revenue. If we are unable to maintain, or develop additional, successful relationships with reputable games promoters, our
ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues could be adversely affected. Increased competition may result in increased pressure on commission rates.

A significant portion of our gaming revenue is generated by clientele of our games promoters. With the rise in gaming in Macau, the competition for services provided by games promoters has increased. We
anticipate that this competition will further intensify as additional casinos are expected to open in Macau in the near future. While we believe that we currently maintain good relations with our existing games promoters, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to continue to maintain these relationships. If we are unable to maintain, or develop additional, successful relationships with reputable games promoters, or lose a significant number of our games promoters to our competitors,
our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues will be adversely affected and we will have to seek alternative ways of developing relationships with VIP customers. In addition, if our games promoters are unable to develop or maintain
relationships with our VIP customers, our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues will be hampered.

Certain games
promoters have significant leverage and bargaining strength in negotiating operational agreements with casino operators. This leverage could result in games promoters negotiating changes to our operational agreements, including higher commissions,
or the loss of business to a competitor or the loss of certain relationships with games promoters. While we have not had to adjust our compensation arrangements with games promoters thus far, we are aware of increased commission rates paid by other
casino operators to games promoters in the Macau market. If we need to increase our commission rates, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

In August 2009, the Macau government published, in its official gazette, certain guidelines with respect to caps on the commission rates payable to gaming promoters that became effective December 1,
2009. Further changes or tightening of caps may occur and if the Macau government were to implement caps on commission rates payable to gaming promoters that causes us to pay them effectively less than the level we currently pay, gaming promoters
may have less incentive to bring travelers to casinos in Macau, including our resort, or may cease operations, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.



The reputations of the games promoters we deal with are important to our own reputation and
to our ability to operate in compliance with our concession and Macau gaming laws. While we endeavor, through contractual protections and otherwise, to ensure that our games promoters comply with the high standards of probity and integrity under
Macau gaming laws, we cannot assure you that our games promoters will always comply with these high standards. In addition, if we enter into a business relationship with a games promoter whose probity is in doubt, this may be considered by
regulators or investors to reflect negatively on our own probity. If any of our games promoters violate the Macau gaming laws while on our premises, the Macau government may, in its discretion, take enforcement action against us, the games promoter,
or each concurrently, and we may be sanctioned and our reputation could be harmed. If our games promoters are unable to maintain required standards of probity and integrity, we may face consequences from gaming regulators with authority over our
operations.

The financial resources of our games promoters may be insufficient to allow them to continue doing business
at our resort.

Our games promoters may encounter decreased liquidity, for a variety of reasons, limiting their ability
to grant credit to their patrons and thereby decreasing gaming volume at Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau. Furthermore, credit already extended by our games promoters to their patrons may become increasingly difficult for them to collect. This
inability to grant credit and collect amounts due can negatively affect our games promoters’ operations, and as a result, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau may be affected by adverse political and economic conditions.

The success of Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau will depend on political and economic conditions in Macau and mainland China. In
December 1999, after approximately 450 years of Portuguese control, Portugal returned Macau to Chinese administration. The People’s Republic of China established Macau as a special administrative region. As a result of this change in
control, Macau’s legislative, regulatory, legal, economic and cultural institutions are in a period of transition. We cannot predict how these systems and cultural institutions will develop, or how developments would affect the business of Wynn
Macau.

Our operations are subject to significant political, economic and social risks inherent in doing business in an
emerging market. For example, fiscal decline and civil, domestic or international unrest in Macau, China or the surrounding region could significantly harm our business, not only by reducing customer demand for casino resorts, but also by increasing
the risk of imposition of taxes and exchange controls or other governmental restrictions that might impede its ability to repatriate funds.

In December 2009, Fernando Chui Sai On was inaugurated as the second Chief Executive of Macau. Dr. Chui’s government is formulating new policies to further the development of Macau. Certain of
these policies could affect the gaming industry.

Macau may not have an adequate transportation infrastructure to
accommodate the demand from future development.

Because of additional casino projects which are under construction and
to be developed in the future, the ferry and helicopter services which provide transportation between Macau and Hong Kong may need to be expanded to accommodate the increased visitation of Macau. If transportation facilities to and from Macau are
inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting Macau, the desirability of Macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results of operations of Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau, could be negatively impacted.

Extreme weather conditions may have an adverse impact on Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau.

Macau’s subtropical climate and location on the South China Sea are subject to extreme weather conditions including typhoons and
heavy rainstorms. Unfavorable weather conditions could negatively affect the profitability of our resort complex and prevent or discourage guests from traveling to Macau.



The Macau government can terminate our concession under certain circumstances without
compensation to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.

The Macau
government has the right to unilaterally terminate our concession in the event of our material non-compliance with the basic obligations under the concession and applicable Macau laws. The concession agreement expressly provides that the government
of Macau may unilaterally rescind the concession agreement if Wynn Macau, S.A.:

•

conducts unauthorized games or activities that are excluded from its corporate purpose;

•

suspends gaming operations in Macau for more than seven consecutive days (or more than 14 days in a civil year) without justification;

•

defaults in payment of taxes, premiums, contributions or other required amounts;

•

does not comply with government inspections or supervision;

•

systematically fails to observe its obligations under the concession system;

•

fails to maintain bank guarantees or bonds satisfactory to the government;

•

is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or becomes insolvent;

•

engages in serious fraudulent activity, damaging to the public interest; or,

•

repeatedly violates applicable gaming laws.

If the government of Macau unilaterally rescinds the concession agreement, Wynn Macau, S.A. will be required to compensate the government in accordance with applicable law, and the areas defined as casino
space under Macau law and all of the gaming equipment pertaining to our gaming operations will be transferred to the government without compensation. The loss of our concession would prohibit us from conducting gaming operations in Macau, which
would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.

Conflicts of interest may arise because
certain of our directors and officers are also directors of Wynn Macau, Limited.

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited,
an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts and the developer, owner and operator of Wynn Macau, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Wynn Macau, Limited sold through an initial public
offering, 1,437,500,000 shares (27.7%) of this subsidiary’s common stock. As a result of Wynn Macau, Limited having stockholders who are not affiliated with us, we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or
directors of Wynn Macau, Limited may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of Wynn Macau, Limited. Decisions that could have different implications for Wynn Resorts and Wynn Macau, Limited,
including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with Wynn Macau, Limited, may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest.

Certain Nevada gaming laws apply to Wynn Macau’s gaming activities and associations.

Certain Nevada gaming laws also apply to gaming activities and associations in jurisdictions outside the State of Nevada. With respect to
our Wynn Macau operations, we and our subsidiaries that must be licensed to conduct gaming operations in Nevada are required to comply with certain reporting requirements concerning gaming activities and associations in Macau conducted by our
Macau-related subsidiaries. We and our licensed Nevada subsidiaries also will be subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Gaming Commission if our Macau-related subsidiaries:

•

knowingly violate any Macau laws relating to their Macau gaming operations;



•

fail to conduct Wynn Macau’s operations in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;

•

engage in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable for us because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in
Nevada, reflects or tends to reflect discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to Nevada gaming policies;

•

engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the State of Nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees; or,

•

employ, contract with or associate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevada
on the ground of unsuitability, or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling.

Such disciplinary
action could include suspension, conditioning, limitation or revocation of the registration, licenses or approvals held by us and our licensed Nevada subsidiaries, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, and the imposition of substantial fines.

In addition, if the Nevada State Gaming Control Board determines that any actual or intended activities or associations of our
Macau-related subsidiaries may be prohibited pursuant to one or more of the standards described above, the Nevada State Gaming Control Board can require us and our licensed Nevada subsidiaries to file an application with the Nevada Gaming Commission
for a finding of suitability of the activity or association. If the Nevada Gaming Commission finds that the activity or association in Macau is unsuitable or prohibited, our Macau-related subsidiaries will either be required to terminate the
activity or association, or will be prohibited from undertaking the activity or association. Consequently, should the Nevada Gaming Commission find that our Macau-related subsidiary’s gaming activities or associations in Macau are unsuitable,
those subsidiaries may be prohibited from undertaking their planned gaming activities or associations in Macau, or be required to divest their investment in Macau, possibly on unfavorable terms.

Unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates may increase Wynn Macau’s obligations under the concession agreement and cause
fluctuations in the value of our investment in Macau.

The currency delineated in Wynn Macau’s concession
agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked
to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S.
dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments.

We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca will continue to be linked to the U.S. dollar, which may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies. We
also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level.

Because many of Wynn Macau’s payment and expenditure obligations are in Macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable Macau pataca or Hong Kong dollar rate changes, Wynn Macau’s obligations, as
denominated in U.S. dollars, would increase. In addition, because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that we operate in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars, we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate
between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. Also, if any of our Macau-related entities incur U.S. dollar-denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could
have adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to service its debt.



Currency exchange controls and currency export restrictions could negatively impact
Wynn Macau.

Currency exchange controls and restrictions on the export of currency by certain countries may negatively
impact the success of Wynn Macau. For example, there are currently existing currency exchange controls and restrictions on the export of the renminbi, the currency of China. Restrictions on the export of the renminbi may impede the flow of gaming
customers from China to Macau, inhibit the growth of gaming in Macau and negatively impact Wynn Macau’s gaming operations.

PROPERTIES

Las Vegas Land

We currently own approximately 240 acres of land on or near the Las Vegas Strip consisting of approximately 75 acres at
the northeast corner of the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Sands Avenue on which Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas are located, the approximately 142-acre golf course behind Wynn Las Vegas, approximately 5 acres adjacent to the
golf course on which an office building is located, and approximately 18 acres located across from the Wynn Las Vegas site at Koval Lane and Sands Avenue, a portion of which is improved with an employee parking garage. Our Las Vegas property, with
limited exceptions, is encumbered by a first priority security interest in favor of our lenders under our first mortgage notes and our Wynn Las Vegas bank credit facilities.

Las Vegas Water Rights

We own approximately 834 acre-feet of permitted and
certificated water rights, which we currently use to irrigate the golf course. We also own approximately 151.5 acre-feet of permitted and certificated water rights for commercial use. There are significant cost savings and conservation benefits
associated with using water supplied pursuant to our water rights. We anticipate using our water rights to support future development of the golf course land.

Macau Land Concessions

The government of Macau owns most of the land in
Macau. In most cases, private interests in real property located in Macau are obtained through long-term leases and other grants of rights to use land from the government. In July 2004, our subsidiary, Wynn Macau, S.A., entered into a land
concession contract under which Wynn Macau, S.A. leases from the Macau government an approximately 16-acre parcel of land in downtown Macau’s inner harbor area where Wynn Macau is located. The term of the land concession contract is
25 years from July 2004, and it may be renewed with government approval for successive periods. Wynn Macau, S.A. paid a land concession premium of approximately 319.4 million patacas (approximately US $40 million) for this land
concession.

In 2009, the Company and the Macau government agreed to modify this land concession as a result of the
development of Encore at Wynn Macau and the additional square footage that was added as a result of such development. In November 2009, the Company made an additional one-time land premium payment of approximately 113.4 million patacas
(approximately US $14.2 million). Annual rent of approximately 4.2 million patacas (approximately US $525,000) is being paid in accordance with the land concession contract.

In addition, we have applied to the government of Macau for a land concession for approximately 52 acres on Cotai for future development
and are awaiting final approval. No construction timeline or budget has yet been developed

is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries’ ability to provide funds to us. Restrictions imposed by our subsidiaries’ debt instruments significantly
restrict certain key subsidiaries holding a majority of our assets, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A., from making dividends or distributions to Wynn Resorts. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are
restricted under the indentures governing the first mortgage notes from making certain “restricted payments,” as defined in the indentures. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or
indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. Restricted payments cannot be made unless certain financial and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. In addition, the terms of the other loan agreements of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and
Wynn Macau, S.A. contain similar restrictions.

In December 2010, the Company paid a cash dividend of $8 per share. In each of
May 2010 and August 2010, the Company paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per share.

In November 2009, the Company paid a cash
dividend of $4 per share.

In each of December 2006 and 2007, the Company paid a cash dividend of $6 per share.

Our Board of Directors also approved the commencement of a regular cash dividend program beginning in 2010. Our Board of Directors will
continue to periodically assess the level and appropriateness of any cash dividends.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements
and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. We currently own and operate two casino resort complexes. In Las
Vegas, Nevada, we own and operate Wynn Las Vegas, a destination casino resort which opened on April 28, 2005. In December 2008, we expanded Wynn Las Vegas with the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. We refer to the fully integrated Wynn Las
Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas as our Las Vegas Operations. In the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (“Macau”), we own and operate Wynn Macau, which opened on September 6, 2006. On
April 21, 2010 we opened Encore at Wynn Macau, a further expansion of Wynn Macau. We refer to the fully integrated Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau as our Macau Operations.

In response to our evaluations and the reactions of our guests, we have made and expect to
continue to make enhancements and refinements to this resort complex.

Future Development

Approximately 142 acres of land comprising Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas is currently improved with a golf course. While we
may develop this property in the future, we have no immediate plans to do so.

We have applied to the government of Macau for
a land concession on approximately 52 aces of land on Cotai and are awaiting final government approval on the concession. No construction timeline or budget has yet been developed.

Results of Operations

Our operating results in Macau were strong during
2010; however, reduced levels of consumer spending, high unemployment and increased hotel supply in the Las Vegas market have and may continue to adversely impact our financial results in Las Vegas. Our results for the years presented are not
comparable as the year ended December 31, 2010 includes the operations of Encore at Wynn Macau which opened on April 21, 2010. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2009, includes Encore at Wynn Las Vegas for a full year,
whereas 2008 included only 10 days of operations for Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.

Our net revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (amounts in thousands) are as follows:

Reliance on only two resort complexes (in two geographic regions) for our operating cash flow exposes us to
certain risks that competitors, whose operations are more diversified, may be better able to control. In addition to the concentration of operations in two resort complexes, many of our customers are high-end gaming customers who wager on credit,
thus exposing us to increased credit risk. High-end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results.

Operating Measures

Certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a Consolidated Statement of Income is presented.
There are two methods used to calculate win percentage in the casino industry. In Las Vegas and in the general casino in Macau, customers primarily purchase gaming chips from gaming tables. The cash and net markers used to purchase the gaming chips
from gaming tables are deposited in the gaming table’s drop box. This is the base of measurement that we use in the casino at our Las Vegas Operations and in the general casino at our Macau Operations for calculating win percentage.

In our VIP casino in Macau, customers primarily purchase non-negotiable rolling chips from the casino cage and there is no deposit into a
gaming table drop box from chips purchased from the cage. Non-negotiable chips can only be used to make wagers. Winning wagers are paid in cash chips. The loss of the non-negotiable rolling



chips in the VIP casino is recorded as turnover and provides a base for measuring VIP casino win percentage. Because of this difference in chip purchase activity, the measurement base used in the
general casino is not the same that is used in the VIP casino. It is customary in Macau to measure VIP casino play using this Rolling Chip method.

The measurement method in Las Vegas and in the general casino in Macau effectively tracks the initial purchase of chips while the measurement method in the VIP casino at Wynn Macau effectively tracks the
sum of all losing wagers. Accordingly, the base measurement in the VIP casino is much larger than the general casino. As a result, the expected win percent with the same amount of gaming win (numerator) is smaller in the VIP casino in Macau when
compared to the general casino in Las Vegas and Macau.

Even though both use the same measurement method, we experience
different win percentages in the general casino activity in Las Vegas versus Macau. This difference is primarily due to the difference in the mix of table games between the two casinos. Each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage.
The life to date table games win percentage for our Las Vegas Operations is 22.0% whereas the life to date table games win percentage for the general casino at our Macau Operations is 20.8%.

Below are definitions of the statistics discussed:

•

Table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue.

•

Drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table’s drop box.

•

Turnover is the sum of all losing Rolling Chip wagers within our Macau VIP program.

•

Rolling Chips are identifiable chips that are used to track VIP wagering volume (turnover) for purposes of calculating incentives.

•

Slot win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenue.

•

Average Daily Rate (“ADR”) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied.

•

Revenue per Available Room (“REVPAR”) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms available.

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended
December 31, 2009

Revenues

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 are comprised of $3,245.1 million in casino revenues (77.5% of total net revenues) and $939.6 million of net non-casino revenues (22.5% of total net
revenues). Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were comprised of $2,206.8 million in casino revenues (72.5% of total net revenues) and $838.8 million of net non-casino revenues (27.5% of total net revenues).

Casino revenues are comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2010 of approximately $3,245.1 million represents a $1,038.3 million (or 47%) increase from casino revenues of $2,206.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Our Las Vegas Operations experienced a $28.5 million increase in casino revenues compared to the prior year due to a 3.4% increase in
drop and an increase in our average table games win percentage. Our average table games win percentage (before discounts) for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 22.2% which was within the expected range of 21% to 24% and compares to 20.2% for
the prior year. Slot handle at our Las Vegas Operations decreased 18.3% compared to the prior year; however slot win decreased only 6.9% as more play shifted to higher hold machines.



Casino revenues at our Macau Operations increased $1,009.8 million during the year ended
December 31, 2010, compared to the prior year. We experienced a 77.8% increase in the VIP revenue segment due to a 68.0% increase in turnover. Our win as a percent of turnover was 3.0%, which is at the high end of the expected range of 2.7% to
3.0%, and compares to 2.9% in the prior year. In November 2009 we added two new private gaming salons with 29 VIP tables and on April 21, 2010 we added 37 VIP tables with the opening of Encore at Wynn Macau, which helped drive some of the
growth in our VIP segment during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year. Our VIP casino segment win as a percent of turnover includes a nominal beneficial effect attributable to non-rolling chip play. In our general casino,
drop increased 17.4% when compared to the prior year and the average table games win percentage was 23.6%, which is above the expected range of 19% to 21%. The average table game win percentage for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 21.9%.
Slot handle increased 23.8% compared to the prior year primarily due to the opening of Encore at Wynn Macau and slot win increased by 29.8%.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, room revenues were approximately $400.3 million, an increase of $22.8 million compared to prior year room revenue of $377.5 million. Room revenue at our Las
Vegas Operations decreased approximately $12.7 million compared to the prior year. In Las Vegas, we continued to experience a decrease in room rates during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. We
believe this is due to the current economic conditions in which we operate in the U.S. and the increased capacity in the Las Vegas market including the opening of a new large scale casino hotel in Las Vegas in December 2009. In addition, in July
2010, we commenced a project to remodel all of the rooms at Wynn Las Vegas. Accordingly, we had 3.8% fewer room nights available during the year ended December 31, 2010 which had a negative impact on our room revenues in Las Vegas. This room
remodel is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2011. Room revenue at our Macau Operations increased approximately $35.5 million due to the 414 additional suites added with Encore at Wynn Macau and an increase in the average daily room
rate compared to the prior year.

The table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue.

Other non-casino
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $488.1 million, retail revenues of approximately $214.6 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $72 million, and other revenues from
outlets such as the spa and salon, of approximately $67.7 million. Other non-casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $436.4 million, retail revenues of approximately $165.1
million, entertainment revenues of approximately $57.1 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $66.2 million. Food and beverage revenues at our Las Vegas Operations increased approximately $31.4
million, while our Macau Operations increased $20.3 million, as compared to the prior year. The increase in Las Vegas is due primarily to business in our nightclubs including the opening of the Encore Beach Club and Surrender nightclub in May 2010.
The increase in Macau is primarily due to the opening of Encore at Wynn Macau and increased visitation to our resort. Retail revenues at our Macau Operations increased $52.2 million, offset by a



decrease of $2.7 million in Las Vegas. The increase in Macau is due primarily to increased sales at several outlets, the opening of Wynn and Co. Watches and Jewelry in November 2009, which sells
Cartier and Jaeger Le Coultre products, and new outlets at Encore at Wynn Macau including Chanel, Piaget and Cartier. Entertainment revenues increased over the prior year primarily due to performances by Garth Brooks in the Encore Theater in Las
Vegas which commenced in December 2009, as well as increased revenue from our Le Rêve show.

Departmental,
Administrative and Other Expenses

During the year ended December 31, 2010, departmental expenses included casino
expenses of $2,100.1 million, room expenses of $122.3 million, food and beverage expenses of $272.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $204.6 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately
$391.3 million and approximately $28.3 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2009, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $1,460.1 million, room expenses of $111.6
million, food and beverage expenses of $252.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $166.6 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $365.1 million and approximately $13.7 million charged as a
provision for doubtful accounts receivable. Casino expenses have increased during the year ended December 31, 2010 due primarily to an increase in casino revenues especially at our Macau Operations where we incur a gaming tax and other levies
at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement. Room expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased customer acquisition and marketing costs and the opening
of Encore at Wynn Macau in April 2010. Food and beverage expenses increased commensurate with the increase in revenue.

Entertainment, retail and other expense increased primarily as a result of performances by Garth Brooks in the Encore Theater at Wynn Las
Vegas and increased retail sales in Macau as noted above. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher spending associated with corporate activities. The provision for doubtful accounts receivable increased $14.6 million due
to an increase in credit issuances commensurate with the increase in business volume.

Pre-opening costs

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred $9.5 million of pre-opening costs compared to $1.8 million during the year ended
December 31, 2009. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily related to Encore at Wynn Macau which opened on April 21, 2010 and the Encore Beach Club which opened in Las Vegas on May 28, 2010.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $405.6 million compared to $410.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This decrease is primarily due to assets
with a 5-year life being fully depreciated as of April 2010 at Wynn Las Vegas, offset by depreciation of the assets of Encore at Wynn Macau which were placed in to service in April 2010 and the assets of the Encore Beach Club which were placed in to
service in May 2010.

During the construction of our resorts, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings,
improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these resorts opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. Depreciation expenses will
continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted.

The maximum useful life of assets at our Macau Operations is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which
currently expire in June 2022 and August 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to our Macau Operations is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our Las Vegas Operations.



Property charges and other

Property charges and other generally include costs related to the retirement of assets for remodels and asset abandonments. Property
charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2010, were $25.2 million compared to $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2010 include a contract termination
payment of $14.9 million related to a management contract for certain of the nightclubs at Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and miscellaneous renovations, abandonments and gain/loss on sale of equipment at Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau.
Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2009, include a $16.7 million charge for the abandonment of the front porte-cochere at Encore at Wynn Las Vegas to make way for the Encore Beach Club, the write-off of $6.8 million of
aircraft purchase deposits and $5 million related to miscellaneous renovations, abandonments and loss on sale of equipment.

In response to our evaluation of our resorts and the reactions of our guests, we continue to remodel and make enhancements at our
resorts.

Other non-operating costs and expenses

Interest income was $2.5 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2010 and 2009,
our short-term investment strategy has been to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. Accordingly, our short-term investments include primarily money market funds, U.S. Treasury Bills and time deposits with a purchase maturity of
three months or less.

Interest expense was $222.9 million, net of capitalized interest of $7.2 million,
for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $211.4 million, net of capitalized interest of $10.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our interest expense increased approximately $11.5 million primarily due to (i) an
increase of $33.2 million related to the Wynn Las Vegas $500 million 7


/


% First Mortgage Notes issued in October 2009, (ii) an increase of $8.9 million related to the increase in rate for the Wynn Las Vegas First Mortgage Notes as discussed below, and (iii) a decrease in
interest capitalized of $3.5 million. These increases were offset partially by (i) a decrease of $16 million due to the payoff of the Wynn Resorts term loan in June 2009 and (ii) a decrease of $19.2 million related to reduced amounts
outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau bank revolving credit facilities compared to the prior year.

Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase (or decrease) in swap fair value in each year. We
recorded an expense of approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 resulting from the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. During the year ended
December 31, 2009 we recorded an expense of $2.3 million resulting from the decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see
Item 7A—“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”

In April 2010,
we completed an exchange offer for a portion of the Wynn Las Vegas 6


/


% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 (“the 2014 Notes”). In connection with that exchange offer, the direct costs incurred with third parties of $4.6 million were expensed. Also, in connection with
our July 2010 tender offer for the then outstanding 2014 Notes and subsequent call of all the remaining amounts once the tender was completed, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $ 63.3 million. This included the tender offer
consideration, the call premium and the related write off of the unamortized debt issue costs and original issue discount. These transactions are described in more detail in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

As a result of several debt retirements, we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $18.7
million during the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we purchased and retired outstanding loans of $375 million under the Wynn Resorts Term Loan Facility at a discounted price of 97.25%. In connection
with this transaction, we recognized an $8.8 million gain on early retirement of debt, net of the write-off of unamortized debt issue cost. During this same period, we purchased $65.8 million face amount of the



2014 Notes through open market purchases at a discount. This transaction resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $13.7 million, net of the write off of unamortized debt discount and
debt issue costs. We participated in the April 2010 tender offer noted above with respect to $35.8 million of these notes and accordingly, as of December 31, 2010, Wynn Resorts holds $30 million of this debt which has not been contributed to
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas. For accounting purposes these notes were treated as having been extinguished by Wynn Resorts in 2009. In October 2009, we purchased loans through an offer to purchase loans outstanding under the Wynn Las
Vegas credit agreement, with a face-value of $87.6 million for $84.4 million, reflecting a discounted price of 96.37%. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $2.1 million on early retirement of debt.
Offsetting these gains was the write off of debt issue costs of approximately $5.9 million related to permanent reductions in our bank credit facility as described under Financing Activities below.

Income Taxes

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a tax expense of $20.4 million. Our provision for income taxes is primarily comprised of increases in our foreign and domestic valuation
allowances relating to foreign tax loss carryforwards, other foreign deferred tax assets and U.S. foreign tax credits not considered more likely than not realizable in the future. The tax provision recorded for the valuation allowance increases was
reduced by an income tax benefit recorded for the loss from our U.S. operations. As of June 30, 2010, we no longer consider our portion of the tax earnings and profits of Wynn Macau, Limited to be permanently reinvested. No additional U.S. tax
provision has been made with respect to this amount as we anticipate that U.S. foreign tax credits should be sufficient to eliminate any U.S. tax provision relating to such repatriation. Prior to this change, our earnings attributable to periods
after September 2009, were considered permanently reinvested abroad. The decrease in our current deferred tax liability is primarily attributable to the repatriation of $1.14 billion of Wynn Macau, Limited IPO proceeds not considered permanently
reinvested. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized income tax benefits related to excess tax deductions associated with stock-based compensation costs of $10.5 million.

Effective September 6, 2006, Wynn Macau S.A. received a 5-year exemption from Macau’s 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming
profits. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of $64.4 million in such taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau
Special Gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement. On November 30, 2010, Wynn Macau S.A. received an additional 5-year exemption from Macau’s 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming
profits to December 31, 2015.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Macau Finance Bureau commenced an
examination of the 2006 and 2007 Macau income tax returns of Wynn Macau S.A. We believe that the examination of the 2006 Macau income tax return will likely conclude within the next 12 months; however, we are unable to provide a summary of the
likely examination issues or the impact on unrecognized tax benefits. As of December 31, 2010, no significant issues have been brought to our attention and we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions recorded at Wynn Macau S.A. is
adequate with respect to these years.

During 2010, we reached an agreement with the Appellate division of the IRS regarding
issues raised during the examination of our 2004 and 2005 U.S. income tax returns. The issues for consideration by the Appellate division were temporary differences and related to the deduction of certain costs incurred during the development and
construction of Wynn Las Vegas and the appropriate tax depreciation recovery periods applicable to certain assets. As a result of this settlement with the Appellate division, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $78.4 million. This reduction
in unrecognized tax benefits resulted in a decrease in our liability for uncertain tax positions of $55 million. The settlement of the 2004 and 2005 examination issues did not result in a cash tax payment but rather utilized $88.5 million and $2.5
million in foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards. The statute of limitations for the 2004 and 2005 U.S. income tax returns has been extended to September 30, 2011.



During 2010, we received the results of an IRS examination of our 2006 through 2008 U.S.
income tax returns and filed an appeal of the examination’s findings with the Appellate division of the IRS. In connection with that appeal, we agreed to extend the statute of limitations for our 2006 and 2007 U.S. income tax returns to
December 31, 2011. We believe that we will likely reach an agreement with the IRS with respect to the examination of these U.S. income tax returns within the next 12 months. The issues under examination in these years are temporary differences
and relate to the treatment of discounts extended to Las Vegas casino customers gambling on credit, the deduction of certain costs incurred during the development and construction of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and the appropriate tax depreciation
recovery periods applicable to certain assets. Upon the settlement of these issues, unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $0 to $54 million. The resolution of the 2006, 2007 and 2008 examination is not expected to result in any significant
cash payment but rather the utilization of a portion of our foreign tax credit carryforward.

During the fourth quarter of
2010, the IRS commenced an examination of our 2009 U.S. income tax return. Since the examination is in its initial stages, we are unable to determine if it will conclude within the next twelve months. We believe that our liability for uncertain tax
positions related to the period covered by the examination is adequate. The resolution of the 2009 IRS examination is not expected to result in any significant cash payment, but rather the utilization of a portion of our 2009 foreign tax credit
carryforward.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and the developer, owner and operator of Wynn Macau, listed its
ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 shares (27.7%) of its common stock through an initial public offering. We recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling
interests of $156.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $18.5 million for the period October 9, 2009, the date of the initial public offering, to December 31, 2009. This represents the noncontrolling
interests’ share of net income from Wynn Macau, Limited.

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31,
2009 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008

As noted earlier, our financial results for the year ended
December 31, 2009 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2008, as the year ended December 31, 2009 includes the operations of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas which opened on December 22, 2008, whereas the prior year includes
only 10 days of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas.

Revenues

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 are comprised of $2,206.8 million in casino revenues (72.5% of total net revenues)
and $838.8 million of net non-casino revenues (27.5% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were comprised of $2,261.9 million in casino revenues (75.7% of total net revenues) and $725.4 million of net
non-casino revenues (24.3% of total net revenues).

Casino revenues are comprised of the net win from our table games and slot
machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 of approximately $2,206.8 million represents a $55.1 million (or 2.4 %) decrease from casino revenues of $2,261.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. We
expanded Wynn Las Vegas with the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in December 2008. Encore added approximately 90 table games and approximately 800 slot machines to our Las Vegas casino operations. Even with these additions in capacity, our Las
Vegas Operations experienced only a 5.4% increase in casino revenues, from $479.7 million in 2008 to $505.8 million in 2009, due to an increase in drop of 1.2% and a slight increase in our average table games win percentage. Our average table games
win percentage (before discounts) for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 20.2%, which was below the expected range of 21% to 24% and compares to 20.0% for the prior year. Slot handle at our Las Vegas Operations decreased 2.5% during the year
ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%.



Casino revenues at Wynn Macau decreased $81.2 million during the year ended
December 31, 2009, compared to the prior year. At Wynn Macau, we experienced an 8% decrease in the VIP revenue segment primarily due to a 2% decrease in turnover and a decrease in our win as a percent of turnover. Our win as a percent of
turnover was 2.9%, which was within the expected range of 2.7% to 3.0%, and compares to 3.0% in 2008. Our VIP casino segment win as a percent of turnover includes a nominal beneficial effect attributable to non-rolling chip play in that segment. In
our general casino at Wynn Macau, drop decreased 12.2% when compared to the prior year and the average table games win percentage was 21.9%, which was above the expected range of 19% to 21%. The average table games win percentage in the general
casino at Wynn Macau for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 19.6%. Slot handle at Wynn Macau increased 12.7% compared to the prior year and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 4.5% to 5.5%. The increase in slot handle was
primarily due to the play of several high-end slot customers.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, room revenues were
approximately $377.5 million, an increase of $50.8 million compared to prior year room revenue of $326.7 million. Room revenue at our Las Vegas Operations increased approximately $52.6 million compared to the prior year due to the addition of 2,034
suites at Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which opened December 22, 2008. In Las Vegas, we continued to experience a significant decrease in occupancy and room rates during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended
December 31, 2008. Room revenue at Wynn Macau decreased approximately $1.8 million due to a decrease in room rates compared to the prior year.

The table below sets forth key operating measures related to room revenue.

Other non-casino
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 include food and beverage revenues of approximately $436.4 million, retail revenues of approximately $165.1 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $57.1 million, and other revenues from
outlets such as the spa and salon, of approximately $66.2 million. Other non-gaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 include food and beverage revenues of approximately $358.7 million, retail revenues of approximately $147.9
million, entertainment revenues of approximately $66.2 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $56 million. Food and beverage revenues at our Las Vegas Operations increased as a result of the
additional 12 food and beverage outlets located in Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, including a new night club, which opened in December 2008, offset by a decrease of $2.4 million at Wynn Macau, as compared to the prior year. Although we added new retail
outlets at Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, overall retail revenues in Las Vegas were flat. Retail revenues at Wynn Macau increased approximately $16.9 million due primarily to increased sales at several retail outlets and the opening of Wynn and Co.
Watches and Jewelry, which sells Cartier, Jaeger Le Coultre, and Kwiat products. Entertainment revenues decreased over the prior year primarily due to the closure of the Spamalot production show at Wynn Las Vegas in July 2008. This decrease was
offset in part by revenue from headliner acts that performed during 2009, including Garth Brooks, who began performing in the Encore Theater in December 2009.



Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses

During the year ended December 31, 2009, departmental expenses include casino expense of $1,460.1 million, rooms expense of $111.6
million, food and beverage expense of $252.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expense of $166.6 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $365.1 million and approximately $13.7 million charged as a
provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2008, departmental expenses include casino expenses of $1,490.9 million, room expenses of $78.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $207.3 million, and
entertainment and retail and other expenses of $161.9 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $319.3 million and approximately $49.4 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. Casino
expenses have decreased during the year ended December 31, 2009, due to a decrease in casino revenues especially at Wynn Macau where a gaming tax of 39% is the significant driver of expense in that department. Room, food and beverage and
general and administrative expenses increased as a result of the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in December 2008. Entertainment, retail and other expense increased primarily in the entertainment department due to headliner performances during
the year. Our provision for doubtful accounts receivable declined during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the prior year due to recent strong collection trends on our casino accounts receivable. This strength has allowed us to
reduce the additional reserves we recorded in the third quarter of 2008.

Pre-opening costs

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred pre-opening costs of $1.8 million compared to $72.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2008. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009 were related to Encore at Wynn Macau. Pre-opening costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008 were related to Encore at Wynn Las Vegas
which opened in December 2008.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2009, of $410.5 million increased by $147.3 million when compared to
the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to depreciation of the assets of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas which were placed into service in December 2008.

During the construction of our resorts, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations are capitalized. Once these resorts
opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. Depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful
life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted.

The maximum useful life of
assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to
our Las Vegas Operations.

Property charges and other

Property charges and other generally include costs related to the retirement of assets for remodels and asset abandonments. Property
charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $28.5 million compared to approximately $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a $16.7
million charge for the abandonment of the front porte-cochere at Encore at Wynn Las Vegas to make way for the Encore Beach Club, a $6.8 million charge for the write-off of 2 aircraft deposits and a $5 million charge related to miscellaneous
remodels, abandonments and loss on sale of equipment.



Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2008 include $17.8 million
of costs associated with Spamalot at Wynn Las Vegas which closed in July 2008. The costs included the production rights that were included in intangible assets, show production costs that were included in other assets and certain other property and
equipment. In 2008, we also incurred a $3.6 million charge at Wynn Macau related to the abandonment of certain existing floor space to begin construction of a new restaurant. The remaining property charges during 2008 were related to miscellaneous
renovations and abandonments at both Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau.

We expect to continue to remodel and make enhancements at
our resorts.

Other non-operating costs and expenses

Interest income was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2008. Interest income decreased $19.8 million primarily due to a significant decrease in the average interest rates earned on invested cash balances compared to the prior year. During 2009, our short-term investment strategy was primarily to
preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. Accordingly, our short-term investments were primarily in investments in U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of three months or less.

Interest expense was $211.4 million, net of capitalized interest of $10.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to
$172.7 million, net of capitalized interest of $87.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our interest expense increased due to (i) $76.7 million less of capitalized interest related to our construction activities with the
opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in December 2008, (ii) approximately $8.4 million of interest related to the 7 7/8% $500 million First Mortgage Notes issued in October 2009, (iii) approximately $3.9 million of interest related to
additional borrowings on our Wynn Macau credit facilities during the year and (iv) approximately $0.6 million of interest associated with increased interest rates on the Wynn Las Vegas revolver. These increases were offset by
(i) approximately $38.6 million less interest due to the November 2008 paydown of the Wynn Resorts term loan, as well as the subsequent $375 million payoff of such term loan in June 2009, (ii) approximately $3 million less interest related
to the purchase of $65.8 million of 2014 Notes and (iii) approximately $9.3 million less interest due to lower average interest rates on the remainder of our debt including the expiration of the Wynn Las Vegas interest rate swap in December
2008.

Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as an increase (or decrease) in swap fair value in
each year. We recorded an expense of approximately $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 resulting from the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. During the year
ended December 31, 2008 we recorded an expense of $31.5 million resulting from the net decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008. For further information on our interest rate
swaps, see Item 7A—“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”

As a result of several
debt retirements, we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $18.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2009, we purchased and retired outstanding loans of $375 million under the Wynn Resorts term loan at a
discounted price of 97.25%. In connection with this transaction, we recognized an $8.8 million gain on early retirement of debt, net of the write-off of unamortized debt issue cost. We purchased $65.8 million face amount of the 2014 Notes through
open market purchases at a discount. This transaction resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $13.7 million, net of the write off of unamortized debt discount and debt issue costs. As of December 31, 2009, Wynn Resorts holds this
debt and has not contributed it to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas. However, for accounting purposes this transaction has been treated as an extinguishment of debt by Wynn Resorts. In October 2009, we purchased loans through an offer to
purchase loans outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas credit agreement, with a face-value of $87.6 million for $84.4 million, reflecting a discounted price of 96.37%. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a gain of approximately $2.1
million on early retirement of debt in the fourth quarter of 2009.



Other represents the loss recognized in connection with foreign currency remeasurements of
assets and liabilities in Macau that are not denominated in the local currency.

Income Taxes

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a tax expense of $3.0 million. Our provision for income taxes primarily relates
to an increase in a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits resulting from the repatriation of Wynn Macau earnings and the Wynn Macau Limited IPO proceeds. As discussed in our footnote on income taxes (Note 15), we currently do not
consider forecasted future operating results when scheduling the realization of deferred tax assets and the required valuation allowance but instead rely solely on the reversal of net taxable temporary differences. The ultimate realization of our
recorded foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is dependent upon the incurrence of sufficient U.S. income tax liabilities attributable to foreign source income during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period.

As of December 31, 2009, we have provided deferred income taxes net of foreign tax credits on the Wynn Macau Limited IPO proceeds
(Note 13) planned for repatriation. No deferred income taxes have been provided for earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered permanently reinvested. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a tax benefit of $61.6 million
primarily associated with foreign tax credits applicable to earnings not considered permanently invested abroad. As of December 31, 2008, none of our foreign earnings were considered permanently invested abroad.

Effective September 6, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received a 5-year exemption from Macau’s 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming
profits. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of $31.7 million in such taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau
Special Gaming tax and other levies totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement. In June 2009, Wynn Macau, S.A. entered into an agreement with the Macau Special Administrative Region that provides for an annual payment of MOP $7.2
million (approximately $900,000 US dollars) to the Macau Special Administrative Region as complementary tax due by shareholders of Wynn Macau S.A. on dividend distributions. This agreement is effective as of 2006. Therefore, included in the tax
provision for the year ended December 31, 2009, are the amounts related to the years 2006 through 2009 totaling $3.6 million. This agreement on dividends is effective through 2010.

In February 2010, we entered into a Pre-Filing Agreement (“PFA”) with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) providing
that the Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax and can be claimed as a U.S. foreign tax credit. In January 2010, the IRS commenced an examination of the company’s 2006, 2007, and 2008 U.S. federal income tax
returns. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received the results of an IRS examination of our 2004 and 2005 tax returns and we filed an appeal of the examination’s findings. In connection with that appeal, we agreed to extend the
statute of limitations for our 2004 and 2005 tax returns to March 15, 2011. We do not expect resolution of the findings within 12 months. We believe that our liabilities for uncertain tax positions related to the examination’s findings are
adequate. The resolution of the 2004 and 2005 IRS examination is not expected to result in any significant cash payment, but rather the utilization of a portion of our 2008 foreign tax credit carryforward.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and the developer, owner and operator of Wynn Macau, had its ordinary shares of common stock listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong Limited. Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 (27.7%) shares of its common stock through an initial public offering. The $18.5 million represents the noncontrolling interests share of our net income for the period from October 9,
2009, the date of the IPO, through December 31, 2009.



Adjusted Property EBITDA

Adjusted property EBITDA is used by us to manage the operating results of our segments. Adjusted property EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property
charges and other, corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating income and expenses, and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental
disclosure because we believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. We use adjusted property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of our segments and to compare the
operating performance of our properties with those of our competitors. We also present adjusted property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company’s ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures
and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In order to view the operations of
their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses that do not relate to the management of specific
casino properties. However, adjusted property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an
alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, adjusted property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of
capital. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property EBITDA. Also, our calculation of
adjusted property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

The following table summarizes adjusted property EBITDA for our domestic (Wynn Las Vegas) and foreign (Wynn Macau) operations as reviewed by management and summarized in “Item 8—Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statement—Note 17 Segment Information.” That footnote also presents a reconciliation of adjusted property EBITDA to net income.

During the past three years we have experienced disparity between our domestic (Las Vegas) and our foreign
(Macau) operations. Adjusted property EBITDA has grown at our Macau operations, while we have experienced little variance in Las Vegas. This disparity is a direct result of the factors that have impacted the global economy, especially the United
States. Demand in Las Vegas has been flat while demand in Macau has steadily increased. During 2010, the economic environment in the gaming and hotel markets in Las Vegas continued to experience depressed levels of gaming revenue, visitation and
hotel room demand. While certain gaming and hotel statistics have increased from 2009 levels, improvement has not been significant. The average daily room rate increased 2%, visitation increased 2.7% to 37.3 million visitors, and Las Vegas
Strip gaming revenues increased 4.5%, all as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. During 2009, the economic environment in the gaming and hotel markets in Las Vegas experienced declines including among other things, a 3% decrease in
visitation, a 9.4% decrease in Las Vegas Strip gaming revenue and a 22% decrease in average daily room rates, all as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. While our customers in the United States have greatly reduced their spending
levels due to weakness in the overall economy, increases in unemployment and weak consumer confidence, our customer base in Macau has not been impacted as much by such economic factors.



Also contributing to this decrease in the Wynn Las Vegas adjusted property EBITDA from 2008
to 2009 was the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in December 2008. While we added significant capacity to our Las Vegas operations, we experienced a relatively small increase in revenues due to the factors noted herein, but we also incurred
significant additional operating expenses. Our Macau adjusted property EBITDA has increased as that market continues to grow and as we have expanded our resort. Revenues in 2009 declined slightly, however our operating expenses decreased at a
greater rate due primarily to cost savings initiatives implemented during 2009. Refer to the discussions above regarding the specific details of our results of operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flow from Operations

Our operating cash flows primarily consist of our operating income generated by our Las Vegas and Macau resorts (excluding
depreciation and other non-cash charges), interest paid, and changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, and payables. Our table games play both in Macau and Las Vegas is a mix of cash play and credit
play, while our slot machine play is conducted primarily on a cash basis. A significant portion of our table games revenue is attributable to the play of a limited number of high-end international customers that gamble on credit. The ability to
collect these gaming receivables may impact our operating cash flow for the period. Our rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail, and other revenue is conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable. Accordingly, operating
cash flows will be impacted by changes in operating income and accounts receivables.

Net cash provided from operations for
the year ended December 31, 2010 was $1.1 billion compared to $594 million provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase is primarily due to the increase in operating income as a result of increased casino,
food and beverage, entertainment, retail and other department profitability especially from our Macau casino operations as discussed above. Cash flow from operations also benefited from a reduction in cash paid for interest and an increase from
ordinary working capital changes.

Capital Resources

We require a certain amount of cash on hand for operations. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $1.26 billion of cash and cash
equivalents available for operations, debt service and retirement, development activities, general corporate purposes and enhancements to our resorts. Approximately $662.6 million of our cash balance is held by Wynn Resorts, Limited, which is not a
guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. and Wynn Macau, S.A. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $327.2 million of availability under our Wynn Las Vegas
Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $900 million of availability under our Wynn Macau Senior Revolving Credit Facility. Debt maturities in 2011 are $2.7 million, excluding $74.1 million of the Wynn Macau Term Loan that we have presented as a
long-term liability as we have both the intent and ability to refinance this maturity with borrowings under the Wynn Macau Revolver. We believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our bank credit facilities and our existing cash
balances will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated uses of capital during 2011. If any additional financing became necessary, we cannot provide assurance that future borrowings will be available.

Cash and cash equivalents include investments in money market funds, U.S. Treasury Bills and bank time deposits, all with maturities of
less than 90 days.

Investing Activities

Capital expenditures were approximately $283.8 million, $540.9 million and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
and 2008. Our capital expenditures relate primarily to the construction cost associated with Encore at Wynn Macau, which opened in April 2010, the Encore Beach Club and Surrender Nightclub, which opened in May 2010 and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,
which opened in December 2008.



Financing Activities

Wynn Las Vegas First Mortgage Notes

In October 2009, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. (the “Issuers”), our wholly-owned subsidiaries, issued in a private offering, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7
7/8% First Mortgage Notes due November 1, 2017 (the “2017 Notes”) at a price of 97.823% of the principal amount. The Issuers pay interest on the 2017 Notes on May 1st and November 1st of each year. Commencing
November 1, 2013, the 2017 Notes are redeemable at our option at a price equal to 103.938% of the principal amount redeemed and the premium over the principal amount declines ratably on November 1st of each year thereafter to zero on or
after November 1, 2015. The 2017 Notes rank pari passu with the borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities and the outstanding first mortgage notes previously issued by the Issuers. The notes are senior secured obligations of the
Issuers, are guaranteed by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s subsidiaries (subject to some exceptions), and are secured on an equal and ratable basis by a first priority lien on substantially all the existing and future assets of the Issuers and
guarantors. In accordance with the fifth amendment to the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement described below, we used the proceeds of this offering to repay amounts outstanding under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver and Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan.

On March 26, 2010, the Issuers commenced an offer to exchange all outstanding 2014 Notes for 7 7/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2020
(the “2020 Notes”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an offering memorandum and a related letter of transmittal (the “exchange offer”). The exchange offer was conditioned upon, among other things, the
tender of at least $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2014 Notes. The 2020 Notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers and outside the United States in accordance with Rule 144A and Regulation S, respectively, under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The exchange offer closed on April 28, 2010 with approximately $352 million of the 2014 Notes being validly tendered for exchange to the 2020 Notes.

The Issuers pay interest on the 2020 Notes on May 1st and November 1st of each year. Commencing May 1, 2015, the 2020
Notes are redeemable at our option at a price equal to 103.938% of the principal amount redeemed and the premium over the principal amount declines ratably on May 1st of each year thereafter to zero on or after May 1, 2018. The 2020 Notes
rank pari passu in right of payment with borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s credit facilities and 2017 Notes. The 2020 Notes are senior secured obligations of the Issuers, guaranteed by certain of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s subsidiaries and
secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the existing and future assets of the Issuers and guarantors and, subject to approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission, a first priority lien on the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC,
all of which is the same collateral that secures borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s credit facilities and the 2017 Notes.

The noteholders who validly tendered 2014 Notes prior to the early delivery time received an early delivery payment on April 28, 2010 of 1% of the amount tendered in cash, which totaled approximately
$3.5 million. In accordance with accounting standards, this has been included as deferred financing costs and will be amortized over the life of the 2020 Notes. The direct costs of the exchange offer incurred with third parties of $4.6 million were
expensed and are included in Gain / (loss) on extinguishment of debt / exchange offer in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

On August 4, 2010, the Issuers issued $1.32 billion aggregate principal amount of 7 3/4% First Mortgage Notes due August 15,
2020 (the “New 2020 Notes”). The New 2020 Notes were issued at par. The New 2020 Notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers and outside the United States in accordance with Rule 144A and Regulation S, respectively, under the
Securities Act. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC used the net proceeds of the offering along with the proceeds of a $50 million capital contribution from Wynn Resorts, Limited to purchase, and, as applicable, make consent payments for, any and all of the
Issuers’ 2014 Notes that were validly tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s concurrent offer to purchase and consent solicitation with respect to the 2014 Notes, and to redeem all of the 2014 Notes not
tendered. On or prior to August 3, 2010, valid tenders had been received with respect to approximately $951.3 million of the $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 2014 Notes outstanding. On August 4, 2010, tendering holders received
the tender



offer consideration in the amount of $1,004.38, plus a consent payment of $30 for each $1,000 principal amount of 2014 Notes, which totaled $32.7 million. The consent solicitation expired on
August 3, 2010 and the tender offer expired on August 18, 2010. In accordance with accounting standards the consideration and consent fees were expensed and are included in Gain / (loss) on extinguishment of debt / exchange offer in our
Consolidated Statements of Income.

On August 4, 2010, the Trustee, at the request of the Issuers, gave notice of
redemption of any and all of the remaining 2014 Notes. The redemption price was equal to 103.313% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to September 3, 2010. The total redemption
fees paid were $10.9 million. In accordance with accounting standards, the redemption fees were expensed and are included in Gain / (loss) on extinguishment of debt / exchange offer in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Also in connection with this transaction, unamortized debt issue costs and original issue discount related to the 2014 Notes totaling
$18.4 million were expensed and are included in Gain / (loss) on extinguishment of debt / exchange offer in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Issuers pay interest on the New 2020 Notes on February 15th and August 15th of each year. Commencing August 15, 2015, the New 2020 Notes are redeemable at the Company’s option at a
price equal to 103.875% of the principal amount redeemed and the premium over the principal amount declines ratably on August 15th of each year thereafter to zero on or after August 15, 2018. The New 2020 Notes rank pari passu in right of
payment with borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s credit facilities, the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes. The New 2020 Notes are senior secured obligations of the Issuers, guaranteed by certain of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s subsidiaries and
secured on an equal and ratable basis (with certain exceptions) by a first priority lien on substantially all of the existing and future assets of the Issuers and guarantors, and, subject to prior approval from the Nevada gaming authorities, a first
priority lien on the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, all of which is the same collateral that secures borrowings under Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s credit facilities, the 2017 Notes and the 2020 Notes.

Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities

Concurrently with the issuance of the New 2020 Notes, Wynn Las Vegas entered into a seventh amendment, dated August 4, 2010, to the Wynn Las Vegas Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the
“Credit Agreement”). After giving effect to this amendment, the maturity date with respect to a portion of the revolving credit facility and the term facility was extended to July 2015 and August 2015, respectively, and the interest margin
in respect of the extended portion will increase after June 30, 2013. In addition, lenders made incremental term loans of $248.5 million having a maturity date of August 2015. The amendment made certain other changes including eliminating the
maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and reducing the minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio to 1:00 to 1 through June 2013.

As of December 31, 2010, our Credit Agreement consisted of a $108.5 million revolving credit facility, due July 2013 and a $258.4 million revolving credit facility due July 2015 (together the
“Wynn Las Vegas Revolver”), and a fully drawn $44.3 million term loan facility due August 2013 and a fully drawn $330.6 million term loan facility due August 2015 (together the “Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan”). As of December 31,
2010, the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan was fully drawn and we had borrowed $20.1 million under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. We also had $19.7 million of outstanding letters of credit that reduce our availability under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver. We
have availability of approximately $327.2 million under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver as of December 31, 2010.

The Wynn
Las Vegas Term Loan and Revolver are obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and are guaranteed by and secured by substantially all of the assets (except the corporate aircraft) of each of its subsidiaries (other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC). The
obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement rank pari passu in right of payment with their existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness with respect to the 2017 Notes, the 2020
Notes and the New 2020 Notes and senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness.



As described below, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we
(a) extended the maturity of the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver to July 2013, (b) received relief from certain financial covenants, (c) increased the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver by $65 million, (d) repurchased $87.6 million of Wynn Las
Vegas Revolver loans at a discount, and (e) used the net proceeds received from our $500 million


/


% First Mortgage Notes issuance to repay
amounts outstanding, including a permanent reduction of $360 million.

In April 2009, we entered into a fourth
amendment to our Credit Agreement. This amendment, among other things, (i) provides a waiver of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, until the quarter ending June 30, 2011, and increases such thresholds
thereafter; (ii) provides additional flexibility with our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, by reducing such ratio from 1.75 : 1 to 1.25 : 1 beginning June 30, 2009 through March 31, 2011; and
(iii) removes the dollar limit on the equity cure provisions for the purpose of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio over the life of the loan. In exchange for the amendments, we (i) repaid 30% of
the outstanding revolver loans of lenders consenting to the extension of their commitment (approximately $238 million) and permanently reduced such lender commitments by 25%; and (ii) agreed to an increase in the interest rate spread on the
Wynn Las Vegas Revolver from LIBOR plus 1.625% to LIBOR plus 3.0%.

In August 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Credit
Agreement, we expanded the availability of the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver by $65 million.

In September 2009, we entered into a
fifth amendment to our Credit Agreement. This amendment, among other things, (i) permitted Wynn Las Vegas to issue, on or before March 31, 2010, up to $500 million of new senior secured notes and (ii) requires that 75% of the net cash
proceeds of any issuance of new senior secured notes be applied to prepay loans and reduce commitments under the Credit Agreement.

In October 2009, pursuant to an offer to purchase loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement, we purchased loans with a face value of $87.6 million for $84.4 million, reflecting a discounted price of
96.37%. As a result of this transaction, the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver was permanently reduced by $43.8 million and the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan was permanently reduced by $44.8 million.

For borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Revolver we have historically elected Eurodollar loans, which bear interest at 1-month LIBOR and
currently include a margin of 3.0% on the outstanding balance. We also incur a fee of 1.0% on the daily average of unborrowed amounts. For borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Term Loan we have historically elected Eurodollar loans, which bear
interest at 1-month LIBOR and currently include a margin of 1.875% on the term loan due 2013 and 3% on the term loan due 2015.

The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement contains a requirement that we must make mandatory repayments of indebtedness from specified
percentages of excess cash flow. If our Wynn Las Vegas subsidiary meets a Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of greater than 3.5 to 1, such repayment is defined as 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the Credit
Agreement. If the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is less than 3.5 to 1, then no repayment is required. Based on the current economic conditions in which we are operating, we do not believe that Wynn Las Vegas will have excess cash flow for mandatory
repayment pursuant to this provision of the Credit Agreement during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011, and therefore we do not expect to make any mandatory repayments pursuant to this requirement during 2011.

The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement contains customary covenants restricting our activities including, but not limited to: the ability to
sell assets, make capital expenditures, enter into capital leases, make loans or other investments and incur additional indebtedness. In addition, we are required by the financial covenants to maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as
defined, not less than 1.00 to 1 as of December 31, 2010. Management believes that we are in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2010.



Wynn Macau Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2010, our Wynn Macau credit facilities, as amended, consisted of a $550 million equivalent fully-funded senior
term loan facility (the “Wynn Macau Term Loan”), and a $1 billion equivalent senior revolving credit facility (the “Wynn Macau Revolver”) in a combination of Hong Kong and U.S. dollars (together the “Wynn Macau Credit
Facilities”). Wynn Macau, S.A. also has the ability to increase the total facilities by an additional $50 million pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Amended Common Terms Agreement. As of December 31, 2010, the Wynn Macau Term Loan
was fully drawn and we had borrowed $100.2 million under the Wynn Macau Revolver. Consequently, we have approximately $900 million of availability as of December 31, 2010.

The Wynn Macau Term Loan matures in June 2014, and the Wynn Macau Revolver matures in June 2012. The principal amount of the term loan is
required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in September 2011. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR or the Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate (“HIBOR”) plus a margin which was 1.75% through
September 30, 2010. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2010, the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities are subject to a margin of 1.25% to 2.00% depending on Wynn Macau’s leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. At December 31, 2010 the
margin was 1.25% to 1.75%.

Collateral for the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities consists of substantially all of the assets of
Wynn Macau, S.A. Certain affiliates that own interests in Wynn Macau, S.A., either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, have executed guarantees of the loans and pledged their interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. as additional security for
repayment of the loans.

The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain a requirement that Wynn Macau must make mandatory repayments
of indebtedness from specified percentages of excess cash flow. If our Wynn Macau subsidiary meets a Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined, of greater than 4.0 to 1, such repayment is defined as 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defined. If the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio is less than 4.0 to 1, then no repayment is required. Based on current estimates we do not believe that our Consolidated Leverage Ratio during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 will exceed 4.0 to 1, and
therefore we do not expect to make any mandatory repayments pursuant to this requirement during 2011.

The Wynn Macau Credit
Facilities contain customary covenants restricting our activities including, but not limited to: the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on any of its property, sales and leaseback transactions, the ability to
dispose of assets, and make loans or other investments. In addition, we are required by the financial covenants to maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined, of not greater than 4.00 to 1 as of December 31, 2010, and Interest Coverage Ratio, as
defined, of not less than 2.00 to 1. Management believes that we are in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2010. Both the Leverage Ratio and the Interest Coverage Ratio requirements remain at not greater than 4.00 to 1 and not less
than 2.00 to 1, respectively, for each reporting period during 2011.

Wynn Resorts, Limited

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and the developer, owner and operator of Wynn Macau, listed its
ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Through an initial public offering, including the over allotment, Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 shares (27.7%) of its common stock. We received proceeds, net of
related costs, of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of this transaction.

In March 2009, we completed a secondary common
stock offering of approximately 11 million shares resulting in net proceeds of $202.3 million. In November 2008, we completed a secondary common stock offering of 8 million shares resulting in net proceeds of $344.3 million.



In June 2009, we purchased and retired the remaining $375 million of outstanding loans from
the $1 billion term loan we borrowed in June 2007, for the primary purpose of funding our equity repurchase program. The purchase price was $364.7 million reflecting a discounted price of 97.25%. In November 2008, we purchased and retired $625
million of this term loan. The purchase price was $596.1 million, reflecting a discounted price of 95.375%.

During the year
ended December 31, 2009, we purchased $65.8 million face amount of the 2014 Notes through open market purchases for $50 million, reflecting a discounted price of 76.1%. As of December 31, 2009, we held this debt and had not contributed it
to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas. For accounting purposes, this transaction was treated as an extinguishment of debt by Wynn Resorts in 2009. As part of the March 2010 exchange offer discussed above, Wynn Resorts exchanged $30 million
of its 2014 Notes for the 2020 Notes. The remaining $35.8 million were redeemed as part of the tender offer and redemption of all of the 2014 Notes in August 2010 as described above. As of December 31, 2010, Wynn Resorts holds $30 million of
the 2020 Notes which have not been contributed to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas.

On December 7, 2010, we
paid a cash dividend of $8 per share.

On each of May 26, 2010 and August 26, 2010, we paid a cash dividend of $0.25
per share.

On December 3, 2009, we paid a cash dividend of $4.00 per share.

Our Board of Directors has authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.7 billion. The repurchase program may include repurchases
from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. No share repurchases were made during the years ended December 31, 2010 or
2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 10,915,633 shares at a net cost of $940.1 million and during the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased 1,889,321 shares at a net cost of $179.2 million. Accordingly, as
of December 31, 2010, we had repurchased a total of 12,804,954 shares of our common stock for a net cost of $1.1 billion under the program.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have not entered into any transactions
with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives except for previously discussed interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. At December 31, 2010,
we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $19.7 million.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments at December 31, 2010 (amounts in millions):



[1]

Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and LIBOR or HIBOR rates at
December 31, 2010. Such rates are at historical lows as of December 31, 2010. Actual rates will vary.

[2]

Other includes open purchase orders, commitments for an aircraft purchase, fixed gaming tax payments in Macau and other contracts. As further discussed in Item 8
“Financial Statements”, Note 15 “Income Taxes”, of this report, we had $83.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2010. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not
practicable to assign this liability to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2010.

Other Liquidity Matters

Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a
result, our ability to pay dividends is highly dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries’ ability to provide funds to us. Restrictions imposed by our Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau debt instruments significantly restrict our
ability to pay dividends. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indentures governing the 2017 Notes, the 2020 Notes and the New 2020 Notes from making certain “restricted payments” as
defined in the indentures. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial
and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. The Wynn Las Vegas, LLC Credit Facilities contain similar restrictions. While the Wynn Macau Credit Facility contains similar restrictions, Wynn Macau is currently in compliance with all requirements,
namely satisfaction of its leverage ratio, which must be met in order to pay dividends and is presently able to pay dividends in accordance with the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.

Wynn Las Vegas, LLC intends to fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and availability under the Wynn Las
Vegas Revolver. We cannot assure you; however, that our Las Vegas operations will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or the availability of additional indebtedness will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas,
LLC’s indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that Wynn Macau will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.’s debt service obligations with existing cash, operating cash flow and availability under the Wynn Macau Revolver.
However, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on
acceptable terms or at all.

New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise
additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in domestic and international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any
new development would require us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau-related entities.

Wynn Resorts’ articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its common
stock, that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by our Board of
Directors. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its
shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and would increase our leverage ratio.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated
financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant
judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for
doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty rewards, self-insurance, contingencies, litigation and other items. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside
sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.

Development, Construction and Property and Equipment Estimates

During the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. In connection with the
construction and development of our resorts, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings. Once our resorts open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer charged
as pre-opening costs.

During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and
construction of our resorts, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. Depreciation expense related to capitalized
construction costs is recognized when the related assets are placed in service. Upon the opening of our resorts, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resort’s fixed assets.

The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed.

Our leasehold interest in land in Macau under the land concession contract entered into in June 2004 is being amortized over 25 years, to
the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminates in June 2029. Depreciation on a majority of the assets comprising Wynn Macau commenced in September of 2006, when Wynn Macau opened. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn
Macau is deemed to be the remaining life of the land concession or the gaming concession which currently expires in June 2022, as applicable. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau will generally be charged over shorter periods when
compared to Wynn Las Vegas.

Costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The cost and accumulated
depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income.

We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting
standards. For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets
to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the
undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a
discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as
operating expenses.



Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts Receivable

A substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. Credit play, through the issuance of markers,
represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our Las Vegas Operations. While offered, the issuance of credit at our Macau Operations is less significant when compared to Las Vegas. Our goal is to maintain strict controls over the
issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of
outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers issued at our Las Vegas Operations are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States, and United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the
United States.

The enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the United States
varies from country to country. Some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement burdensome. We closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing
credit to customers who are not residents of the United States. In addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both Las Vegas and Macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in
our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.

As of December 31, 2010 and
December 31, 2009, approximately 82% and 76% of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in Asia. In addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of markers given by foreign customers is
affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries.

We regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as management’s prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current
economic and business conditions. In determining our allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable, we apply industry standard reserve percentages to aged account balances and we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a
balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age, the customer’s financial condition, collection history and any other known information. The standard reserve percentages applied are based on our historical experience and take into
consideration current industry and economic conditions.

The following table presents key statistics related to our casino
accounts receivable (amounts in thousands):

Our reserve for doubtful
casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy. Our reserve methodology is applied
similarly to credit extended at each of our resorts. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 35% and 27% respectively, of our outstanding casino account receivable balance originated at our Macau Operations.

At December 31, 2010, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable
would change the provision for doubtful accounts by approximately $2.6 million.



As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve
for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts expense may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as we become
aware of additional information about a customer or changes occur in a region’s economy or legal system.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial
instruments. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income. As of
December 31, 2010, changes in our interest rate swap fair values are being recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income, as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.

We measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps on a recurring basis. Accounting standards establish a three-tier fair value
hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets
that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. We categorize our interest rate swap
contracts as Level 2. The fair value approximates the amount we would receive (pay) if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels
along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. We adjust this amount by applying a
non-performance valuation, considering our creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable.

Stock-Based Compensation

Accounting standards for stock-based
payments establish standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the
entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair
value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to value the equity instruments we issue. The Black-Scholes valuation model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk-free interest
rates, the expected term of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. Management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our Company.

The expected volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly impact the fair value of stock options. We believe that the
valuation techniques and the approach utilized to develop our assumptions are reasonable in calculating the fair value of the options we grant. We estimate the expected stock price volatility using a combination of implied and historical factors
related to our stock price in accordance with applicable accounting standards. As our stock price fluctuates, this estimate will change. For example, a 10% change in the volatility assumption for 2010 would have resulted in an approximate $0.6
million change in fair value. Expected term represents the estimated average time between the option’s grant date and its exercise date. Because of our limited trading history as a public company we have elected to use the simplified method
prescribed by applicable accounting standards, for companies with a limited trading history to estimate the expected term. Once we have sufficient trading history, we will estimate the expected term using historical experience for options that have
been granted to employees within our stock option plan. A 10% change in the expected term assumption for 2010 would have resulted in an approximate $0.2 million change in fair value. These assumed changes in fair value would have been recognized
over the vesting schedule of such awards.



Accounting standards also require the classification of stock compensation expense in the
same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and
administrative expenses (including corporate expenses).

Self-Insurance Reserves

We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs of employee health coverage, workers’ compensation and general liability claims.
Insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. In estimating these accruals, we consider historical loss experience and make
judgments about the expected level of costs per claim. Management believes the estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon its methodology; however, changes in health care costs, accident frequency and severity could materially affect
the estimate for these liabilities.

Customer Loyalty Program

Our customer loyalty program relates to a slot club program whereby customers may earn points based on their level of play that may be
redeemed for free credit that must be replayed in the slot machine. We accrue a liability based on the points earned times the redemption value, less an estimate for breakage, and record a related reduction in casino revenue.

Slot Machine Jackpots

With respect to base and progressive jackpots, we do not accrue a liability in jurisdictions in which we have the ability to avoid payment of the base jackpot because the machine can legally be removed
from the gaming floor without payment of the base amount. Conversely, if we are unable to avoid payment of the jackpot (i.e. the incremental amount on a progressive machine) due to legal requirements, the jackpot is accrued as the obligation becomes
unavoidable. This liability is accrued over the time period in which the incremental progressive jackpot amount is generated with a related reduction in casino revenue. No liability is accrued with respect to the base jackpot.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. Accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and
liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and
deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more
likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.

As of December 31, 2010, we have a foreign tax credit
carryover of $1,307 million and we have recorded a valuation allowance of $1,246 million against this asset based on our estimate of future realization. The foreign tax credits are attributable to the Macau special gaming tax which is 35% of gross
gaming revenue in Macau. The U.S. taxing regime only allows a credit for 35% of “net” foreign source income. Due to our current operating history of U.S. losses, we currently do not rely on forecasted taxable income in order to support the
utilization of the foreign tax credits. The estimated future foreign tax credit realization was based upon the estimated future taxable income from the reversal of “net” U.S. taxable temporary differences that we expect will reverse during
the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period. The amount of the valuation allowance is subject to change based upon the actual reversal of temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences.



Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. We assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes. The accounting standards prescribe a minimum
recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.

Uncertain tax
position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. These accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based
on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the
largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. Use of the term “more likely than not” is consistent with how that term is used in accounting for income taxes (i.e. likelihood of occurrence is greater
than 50%).

Tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period
that they meet the “more likely than not” standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the “more likely than not” standard, it is required that the tax position is
derecognized. Accounting standards for uncertain tax positions specifically prohibit the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions. As applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to
unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized no amounts for interest or penalties.

Effective September 6, 2006, we received a 5-year exemption from Macau’s 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, during 2010 we were exempted from the payment of
approximately $64.4 million in such taxes. On November 30, 2010, Wynn Macau received an additional 5 year exemption to December 31, 2015 related to this tax. Wynn Macau’s non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary
Tax and Wynn Macau’s casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.

Interest Rate Risks

One
of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities.” We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as
believed by us to be appropriate. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies have had the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations.



The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best
estimates of repayments at December 31, 2010 of our expected long-term indebtedness. However, we cannot predict the LIBOR or HIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future. As of December 31, 2010, such rates remain at historic lows.
Actual rates will vary. The one-month LIBOR and HIBOR rates at December 31, 2010 of 0.26% and 0.23%, respectively were used for all variable rate calculations in the table below. The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents as
applicable.

Interest Rate Swap Information

We have entered into floating-for-fixed interest rate swap arrangements relating to certain of our floating-rate debt
facilities. We measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps on a recurring basis.

Wynn Las Vegas

We entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings
under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement. Under this swap agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 2.485% on borrowings of $250 million incurred under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable
interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. This interest rate swap fixes the interest rate on $250 million of borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Agreement at approximately 5.485%. This interest rate swap agreement
matures in November 2012. Changes in the fair value of this interest rate swap have and will continue to be recorded as an increase/ (decrease) in swap fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Income as the swap does not qualify for hedge
accounting.

Wynn Macau

As of December 31, 2010, we had three interest rate swaps intended to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. Under the first swap
agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 3.632% on U.S. dollar borrowings of $153.8 million incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at
the time of payment. As of December 31, 2010, this interest rate swap fixes the interest rate on $153.8 million of the current U.S. dollar borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities at approximately 4.88%-5.38%. Under the second swap
agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 3.39% on Hong Kong dollar borrowings of approximately HK $991.6 million (approximately US$127.9 million) incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a
variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. As of December 31, 2010, this interest rate swap fixes the interest rate on approximately $127.9 million of the current Hong Kong dollar borrowings under the Wynn
Macau Credit Facilities at approximately 4.64%. Both of these interest rate swap agreements mature in August 2011. We entered into a third interest rate swap agreement at Wynn Macau to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on
borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. Under this swap agreement we pay a fixed interest rate of 2.15% on borrowings of approximately HK$2.3 billion (approximately US$300 million) incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in
exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. This interest rate swap fixes the interest rate on HK$2.3 billion



(approximately US$300 million) of borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities at approximately 3.4%. This interest rate swap agreement matures in June 2012.

Changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period recorded are, and will continue to be, recognized as an
increase/(decrease) in swap fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Income, as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Summary of Historical Fair Values

historical liability fair values as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, of our interest rate swap arrangements (amounts in thousands):

The fair value
approximates the amount we would pay if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the
instruments and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. We adjust this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering our
creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable.

Other Interest
Rate Swap Information

The following table provides information about our interest rate swaps, by contractual maturity
dates, as of December 31, 2010 and using estimated future LIBOR and HIBOR rates based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve. The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is our reporting currency:

We do not use derivative
financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 92% of our long-term debt was based on fixed rates, including the notional amounts related to interest rate swaps. Based on our borrowings as of
December 31, 2010, an assumed 1% change in variable rates would cause our annual interest cost to change by $2.8 million.

Foreign Currency Risks

The currency delineated in Wynn Macau’s concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong
dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar



and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the
Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments.

If the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca are not linked to the U.S. dollar in the future, severe fluctuations in the exchange rate
for these currencies may result. We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level.

Because many of Wynn Macau’s payment and expenditure obligations are in Macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable Macau pataca or
Hong Kong dollar rate changes, Wynn Macau’s obligations, as denominated in U.S. dollars, would increase. In addition, because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that Wynn Macau operates in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars, we
are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. Also, if any of our Macau-related entities incur U.S. dollar-denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau
pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on Wynn Macau’s results of operations, financial condition, and ability to service its debt. To date, we have not engaged in hedging activities intended
to protect against foreign currency risk.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Wynn Resorts, Limited and subsidiaries:

We have audited Wynn Resorts, Limited and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Wynn Resorts, Limited and subsidiaries:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wynn Resorts, Limited and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedules listed in the index at item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Organization

Wynn Resorts, Limited, a Nevada corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Wynn Resorts” or the “Company”), was formed in June 2002 and completed an initial public offering of its
common stock on October 25, 2002.

In June 2002, the Company’s indirect subsidiary, Wynn Resorts (Macau), S.A.
(“Wynn Macau, S.A.”), entered into an agreement with the government of the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (“Macau”), granting Wynn Macau, S.A. the right to construct and operate one or
more casino gaming properties in Macau. Wynn Macau, S.A.’s first casino resort in Macau is hereinafter referred to as “Wynn Macau”.

The Company currently owns and operates casino hotel resort properties in Las Vegas, Nevada and Macau. In Las Vegas, Nevada, the Company owns Wynn Las Vegas, which opened on April 28, 2005 and was
expanded with the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas on December 22, 2008. In Macau, the Company owns Wynn Macau, which opened on September 6, 2006 and was expanded with the opening of Encore at Wynn Macau on April 21, 2010.

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the developer, owner and
operator of Wynn Macau, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Through an initial public offering, including the over allotment, Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 shares (27.7%) of this
subsidiary’s common stock.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in the 50%-owned joint ventures operating the Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership and the Brioni mens’ retail clothing store inside Wynn Las
Vegas are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents
of $663.9 million and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were invested in money market funds, U.S. treasuries and time deposits. The Company utilized Level 1 inputs as described in Note 8 to determine fair value.

Accounts Receivable and Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of casino accounts receivable. The Company issues credit in the form of “markers”
to approved



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

casino customers following investigations of creditworthiness. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 82% and 76%, respectively, of the Company’s markers were due from customers
residing outside the United States, primarily in Asia. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables.

Accounts receivable, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost.
Accounts are written off when management deems them to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to
their carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts as well as management’s experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business
conditions.

Inventories

Inventories consist of retail merchandise, food and beverage items which are stated at the lower of cost or market value and certain operating supplies. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out,
average and specific identification methods.

Property and Equipment

Purchases of property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the
straight-line method as follows:

Costs related to
improvements are capitalized, while costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and
any resulting gain or loss is included in operations.

Capitalized Interest

The interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project.
Interest capitalization ceases once a project is substantially complete or no longer undergoing construction activities to prepare it for its intended use. When no debt is specifically identified as being incurred in connection with a construction
project, the Company capitalizes interest on amounts expended on the project at the Company’s weighted average cost of borrowed money. Interest of $7.2 million, $10.7 million and $87.4 million was capitalized for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Intangibles

The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of water rights acquired as part of the original purchase price of
the property on which Wynn Las Vegas is located, and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually. The Company’s finite-lived intangible assets consist of a Macau gaming concession
and show production rights. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of their contractual terms or estimated useful lives.



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, which are to be held and used, including intangibles and property and equipment, are periodically reviewed by
management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. If an indicator of impairment exists, the Company compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on
an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then impairment is measured as the
difference between fair value and carrying value, with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.

Deferred Financing Costs

Direct and incremental costs incurred in obtaining loans or in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are capitalized and amortized to interest expense over the terms of the related debt
agreements. Approximately $13.2 million, $15.4 million and $17.8 million were amortized to interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Debt discounts incurred in connection with the issuance of debt
have been capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

The Company seeks to manage its market risk, including interest rate risk associated with
variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings with the use of derivative financial instruments. The fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at each balance sheet
date, with changes in fair value affecting net income as the Company’s current interest rate swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are presented as an increase (decrease) in
swap fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The differentials paid or received on interest rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense.

Revenue Recognition and Promotional Allowances

The Company recognizes revenues at the time persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is provided or the retail goods are sold, prices are fixed or determinable and collection is
reasonably assured.

Casino revenues are measured by the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with
liabilities recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs and for chips in the customers’ possession. Hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other operating revenues are recognized when services are performed.
Entertainment, retail and other revenue includes rental income which is recognized on a time proportion basis over the lease terms. Contingent rental income is recognized when the right to receive such rental income is established according to the
lease agreements. Advance deposits on rooms and advance ticket sales are recorded as customer deposits until services are provided to the customer.

Revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives which are required to be recorded as a reduction of revenue; consequently, the Company’s casino revenues are reduced by discounts, commissions
and points earned in the player’s club loyalty program.

The retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other
services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenues. Such amounts are then deducted as promotional allowances. These amounts have increased with the opening of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in December 2008 and the opening of Encore
at



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Wynn Macau in April 2010. The estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances is primarily included in casino expenses as follows (amounts in thousands):

Self-Insurance Reserves

The Company is self-insured up to certain limits for costs of employee health coverage, workers’ compensation and general liability
claims. Insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. In estimating these accruals, the Company considers historical loss
experience and makes judgments about the expected level of costs per claim. Management believes the estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon its methodology; however, changes in health care costs, accident frequency and severity could
materially affect the estimate for these liabilities.

Customer Loyalty Program

The Company’s customer loyalty program relates to a slot club program whereby customers may earn points based on their level of play
that may be redeemed for free credit that must be replayed in the slot machine. The Company accrues a liability based on the points earned times the redemption value, less an estimate for breakage, and records a related reduction in casino revenue.

Slot Machine Jackpots

With respect to base and progressive jackpots, the Company does not accrue a liability in jurisdictions in which it has the ability to avoid payment of the base jackpot because the machine can legally be
removed from the gaming floor without payment of the base amount. Conversely, if the Company is unable to avoid payment of the jackpot (i.e. the incremental amount on a progressive machine) due to legal requirements, the jackpot is accrued as the
obligation becomes unavoidable. This liability is accrued over the time period in which the incremental progressive jackpot amount is generated with a related reduction in casino revenue. No liability is accrued with respect to the base jackpot.

Gaming taxes

The Company is subject to taxes based on gross gaming revenue in the jurisdictions in which it operates, subject to applicable jurisdictional adjustments. These gaming taxes are an assessment on the
Company’s gaming revenue and are recorded as an expense within the “Casino” line item in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. These taxes totaled $1,412.8 million, $892.2 million and $919.2 million for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising costs incurred in development periods are
included in pre-opening costs. Once a project is completed, advertising costs



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

are included in general and administrative expenses. Total advertising costs were $19 million, $20.4 million and $31.2 million, including $11.1 million in 2008 for pre-opening related to Encore
at Wynn Las Vegas, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Pre-Opening Costs

Pre-opening costs consists primarily of direct salaries and wages, legal and consulting fees, insurance, utilities and
advertising, and are expensed as incurred. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company incurred pre-opening costs in connection with the Encore Beach Club and Surrender Nightclub which opened in May 2010, and Encore at Wynn Macau prior
to its opening in April 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company incurred pre-opening costs in connection with Encore at Wynn Las Vegas prior to its opening in December 2008.

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where it operates. Accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable
reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax
provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Accounting standards also require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such
benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.

The Company’s income tax returns are
subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities in the locations where it operates. The Company assesses potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for
uncertain income taxes. The accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.

Uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. These accounting standards utilize a
two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only
addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. Use of the term “more
likely than not” is consistent with how that term is used in accounting for income taxes (i.e. likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%).

Tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the “more likely than not” standard. If it is subsequently
determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the “more likely than not” standard, it is required that the tax position is derecognized. Accounting standards for uncertain tax positions specifically prohibit the use
of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions. As applicable, the Company will recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized no amounts for interest or penalties.



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

Currency Translation

Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurements are included in other income/expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Income. The results of operations and the balance sheet of Wynn Macau, S.A. are translated from Macau Patacas to U.S. dollars. Balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are
translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income includes net income and all other non-stockholder changes in equity, or other comprehensive income. Components of the Company’s comprehensive income are reported in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. The cumulative balance of other comprehensive income consists solely of currency translation adjustments.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share (“EPS’) is
computed by dividing net income attributable to Wynn Resorts by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS reflects the addition of potentially dilutive securities which for the Company include: stock options and
nonvested stock.

The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares used in the calculation of basic and
diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, consisted of the following (amounts in thousands):




Weighted average common shares outstanding (used in calculation of basic earnings per share)

122,787

119,840

108,408

Potential dilution from the assumed exercise of stock options and nonvested stock

1,152


1,033

Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding (used in calculation of diluted earnings per
share)

123,939

120,185

109,441

A total of 1,078,000, 4,899,918 and 880,000 stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS
at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, because including them would have been anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

Accounting standards require the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that
cost over the service period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the estimated fair value for each option grant issued. The Black-Scholes determined fair value net of estimated forfeitures is amortized as compensation
cost on a straight line basis over the service period.

Further information on the Company’s stock-based compensation
arrangements is included in Note 14 “Benefit Plans—Stock-Based Compensation”.

In addition to scheduled amortization payments, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC is required to make mandatory prepayments of indebtedness under the
Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities from the net proceeds of all debt offerings (other than those constituting certain permitted debt). Wynn Las Vegas, LLC is also required to make mandatory repayments of indebtedness under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit
Facilities from specified percentages of excess cash flow, which percentages may decrease and/or be eliminated based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s leverage ratio. The Company does not expect to make any mandatory repayments pursuant to this
requirement during 2011. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC has the option to prepay all or any portion of the indebtedness under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty.

The Credit Agreement contains customary negative covenants and financial covenants, including negative covenants that restrict Wynn Las

Wynn Macau Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company’s Wynn Macau credit facilities, as amended, consisted of a $550 million equivalent
fully-funded senior term loan facility (the “Wynn Macau Term Loan”), and a $1 billion senior revolving credit facility (the “Wynn Macau Revolver”) in a combination of Hong Kong and U.S. dollars (together the “Wynn Macau
Credit Facilities”). Wynn Macau, S.A. also has the ability to increase the total facilities by an additional $50 million pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Amended Common Terms Agreement. As of December 31, 2010, the Wynn Macau
Term Loan was fully drawn and $100.2 million was outstanding under the Wynn Macau Revolver. Consequently, there was availability of approximately $900 million under the Wynn Macau Revolver as of December 31, 2010.

The Wynn Macau Term Loan matures in June 2014, and the Wynn Macau Revolver matures in June 2012. The principal amount of the Wynn Macau
Term Loan is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing in September 2011. Borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities bear interest at LIBOR or the Hong Kong Interbank Offer Rate (“HIBOR”) plus a margin which was
1.75% through September 30, 2010. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2010, the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities are subject to a margin of 1.25% to 2.00% depending on Wynn Macau’s leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. At
December 31, 2010 the margin was 1.25% to 1.75%.

Collateral for the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities consists of
substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. Certain affiliates of the Company that own interests in Wynn Macau, S.A., either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, have executed guarantees of the loans and pledged their interests
in Wynn Macau, S.A. as additional security for repayment of the loans. In addition, the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities’ governing documents contain capital spending limits and other affirmative and negative covenants.

The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities contain a requirement that the Company must make mandatory repayments of indebtedness from specified
percentages of excess cash flow. If the Wynn Macau subsidiary meets a Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined, of greater than 4.0 to 1, such repayment is defined as 50% of Excess Cash Flow, as defined. If the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is less
than 4.0 to 1, then no repayment is required. Based on current estimates the Company does not believe that the Wynn Macau Consolidated Leverage Ratio during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 will exceed 4.0 to 1. Accordingly, the Company
does not expect to make any mandatory repayments pursuant to this requirement during 2011.

The Wynn Macau Credit Facilities
contain customary covenants restricting certain activities including, but not limited to: the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on any of its property, sales and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose
of assets, and make loans or other investments. In addition, Wynn Macau was required by the financial covenants to maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined, of not greater than 4.00 to 1 as of December 31, 2010, and an Interest Coverage Ratio, as
defined, of not less than 2.00 to 1. Management believes that the Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2010.

In 2011, $74.1 million of the Wynn Macau Senior Term Loan Facility is due. In accordance with accounting standards, this $74.1 million has been classified as long-term debt as of December 31, 2010,
because the Company has both the intent and ability to repay such amount with borrowings available under the Wynn Macau Senior Revolving Credit Facility, which does not mature until June 2012.

In connection with the initial financing of Wynn Macau, Wynn Macau, S.A. entered into a Bank Guarantee Reimbursement Agreement with Banco
Nacional Ultramarino, S.A. (“BNU”) for the benefit of the Macau government. This guarantee assures Wynn Macau, S.A.’s performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any
material failure to perform under the terms of the concession agreement. As of December 31, 2010, the guarantee was in the amount of $300 million

secured by a second priority security interest in the senior lender collateral package. From and after repayment of all indebtedness under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities, Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated to promptly, upon demand by BNU, repay any
claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. BNU is paid an annual fee for the guarantee not to exceed approximately $5.2 million Macau Patacas (approximately US$0.7 million).

8. Interest Rate Swaps

The Company has entered into floating-for-fixed interest rate swap arrangements in order to manage interest rate risk relating to certain of its debt facilities. These interest rate swap agreements modify
the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of the Company’s floating-rate debt to a fixed rate. These interest rate swaps essentially fix the interest rate at the percentages noted below; however, changes in the
fair value of the interest rate swaps for each reporting period have been recorded in the increase/decrease in swap fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income, as the interest rate swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting.

The Company measures the fair value of its interest rate swaps on a recurring basis pursuant to accounting standards for fair
value measurements. These standards establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2,
defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions. The Company categorizes these swap contracts as Level 2.

The following table presents the historical fair value
of the interest rate swaps recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The fair value approximates the amount the Company would pay if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation
dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a
high degree of variability and fluctuation between periods. The fair value is adjusted, to reflect the impact of credit ratings of the counterparties or the Company, as applicable. These adjustments resulted in a reduction in the fair values as
compared to their settlement values. As of December 31, 2010, $5.9 million of the interest rate swap liabilities are included in other accrued expenses and $15.6 million are included in other long-term liabilities. As of December 31, 2009,
the interest rate swap liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities.

Wynn Las Vegas
Swap

The Company currently has one interest rate swap agreement to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate
risk on borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities. Under this swap agreement, beginning November 27, 2009, the Company pays a fixed interest rate of 2.485% on borrowings of $250 million incurred under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit
Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. This interest rate swap fixes the interest rate on $250 million of borrowings at 5.485%. This interest rate swap
agreement matures in November 2012.

Wynn Macau Swaps

The Company has two interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Wynn
Macau Credit Facilities. Under the first swap agreement, the Company pays a fixed interest rate of 3.632% on U.S. dollar borrowings of $153.8 million incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a
variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR

at the time of payment. Under the second swap agreement, the Company pays a fixed interest rate of 3.39% on Hong Kong dollar borrowings of HK $991.6 million (approximately US$127.9 million)
incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities in exchange for receipt on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. As of December 31, 2010, these interest rate swaps fix the interest
rates on the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities at 4.88%-5.38% and 4.64%, respectively. These interest rate swap agreements mature in August 2011.

The Company entered into a third interest rate swap agreement effective November 27, 2009, to hedge a portion of the underlying
interest rate risk on borrowings under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities. Under this swap agreement, the Company pays a fixed interest rate of 2.15% on borrowings of HK$2.3 billion (approximately US$300 million) incurred under the Wynn Macau Credit
Facilities in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. As of December 31, 2010, this interest rate swap fixes the interest rate on such borrowings at 3.4%. This
interest rate swap agreement matures in June 2012.

Committee with the assistance of a third-party appraisal. Certain services for, and maintenance of, the villa suite are included in the rental. The EW Lease superseded the terms of a prior agreement.

On March 18, 2010, Mr. Wynn and Wynn Las Vegas entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement of Lease (the “SW
Lease”) for a villa suite to serve as Mr. Wynn’s personal residence. The SW Lease amends and restates a prior lease. The SW Lease was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. The term of the SW Lease
commenced as of March 1, 2010 and runs concurrent with Mr. Wynn’s employment agreement with the Company; provided that either party may terminate on 90 days notice. Pursuant to the SW Lease, the rental value of the villa suite will be
treated as imputed income to Mr. Wynn, and will be equal to the fair market value of the accommodations provided. Effective March 1, 2010, and for the first two years of the term of the SW Lease, the rental value will be $503,831 per year.
The rental value for the villa suite will be re-determined every two years during the term of the lease by the Audit Committee, with the assistance of an independent third-party appraisal. Certain services for, and maintenance of, the villa suite
are included in the rental.

Home Purchase

In May 2010, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Linda Chen, who is also a director of Wynn Resorts. The term of the
new employment agreement is through February 24, 2020. Under the terms of the new employment agreement, the Company purchased a home in Macau for use by Ms. Chen for approximately $5.4 million, and will expend additional funds to renovate
the home and will also provide Ms. Chen the use of an automobile in Macau. Upon the occurrence of certain events set forth below, Ms. Chen shall have the option to purchase the home at the then fair market value of the home (as determined
by an independent appraiser) less a discount equal to ten percentage points multiplied by each anniversary of the term of the agreement that has occurred (the “Discount Percentage”). The option is exercisable for (a) no consideration
at the end of the term, (b) $1.00 in the event of termination of Ms. Chen’s employment without “cause” or termination of Ms. Chen’s employment for “good reason” following a “change of control”
and (c) at a price based on the applicable Discount Percentage in the event Ms. Chen terminates the agreement due to material breach by the Company. Upon Ms. Chen’s termination for “cause,” Ms. Chen will be deemed
to have elected to purchase the Macau home based on the applicable Discount Percentage unless the Company determines to not require Ms. Chen to purchase the home. If Ms. Chen’s employment terminates for any other reason before the
expiration of the term (e.g., because of her death or disability or due to revocation of gaming license), the option will terminate.

The “Wynn” Surname Rights Agreement

On August 6,
2004, the Company entered into agreements with Mr. Wynn that confirm and clarify the Company’s rights to use the “Wynn” name and Mr. Wynn’s persona in connection with its casino resorts. Under the parties’ Surname
Rights Agreement, Mr. Wynn granted the Company an exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual, worldwide license to use, and to own and register trademarks and service marks incorporating the “Wynn” name for casino resorts and related
businesses, together with the right to sublicense the name and marks to its affiliates. Under the parties’ Rights of Publicity License, Mr. Wynn granted the Company the exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right to use his full name, persona

13. Noncontrolling Interest

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the developer, owner and operator of Wynn Macau, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Through an initial public offering, including the over allotment, Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 shares (27.7%) of this subsidiary’s common stock (the “Wynn Macau Limited IPO”). Proceeds to
the Company as a result of this transaction were approximately $1.8 billion, net of transaction costs of approximately $84 million. The shares of Wynn Macau, Limited were not and will not be registered under the Securities Act, and may not be
offered or sold in the United States absent a registration under the Securities Act, or an applicable exception from such registration requirements. In connection with this transaction, in October 2009, the Company recorded $107.4 million of
noncontrolling interest as a separate component of equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and has followed accounting standards for noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements beginning in October 2009. Net

14. Benefit Plans

Employee Savings Plan

The Company established a retirement savings
plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering its U.S. non-union employees in July 2000. The plan allows employees to defer, within prescribed limits, a percentage of their income on a pre-tax basis through contributions
to this plan. Prior to March 16, 2009, the Company matched the contributions, within prescribed limits, with an amount equal to 100% of the participant’s initial 2% tax deferred contribution and 50% of the tax deferred contribution between
2% and 4% of the participant’s compensation. The Company recorded an expense for matching contributions of $0, $1.4 million and $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Effective March 16, 2009,
the Company suspended matching contributions to this plan.

Wynn Macau also operates a defined contribution retirement
benefits scheme (the “Scheme”). The Scheme allows eligible employees to contribute 5% of their salary to the Scheme and the Company matches any contributions. The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the Company
in an independently administered fund. The Company’s matching contributions vest to the employee at 10% per year with full vesting in ten years. Forfeitures of unvested contributions are used to reduce the Company’s
liability for its contributions payable under the Scheme. For the period from March 1, 2009 through April 30, 2010, the Company suspended its matching contributions. The contributions were reinstated effective May 1,
2010. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded an expense for matching contributions of $3.3 million, $0.5 million and $6.1 million, respectively.

Union employees in the Las Vegas operations are covered by various multi-employer pension plans. The Company recorded an expense of $6.8
million, $6.2 million and $4.6 million under such plans for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Information from the plans’ sponsors is not available to permit the Company to determine its share of unfunded
vested benefits, if any.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company established the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the “WRL Stock Plan”) to provide for the grant of (i) incentive
stock options, (ii) compensatory (i.e. nonqualified) stock options, and (iii) nonvested shares of Common Stock of Wynn Resorts, Limited. Employees, directors (whether employee or nonemployee) and independent contractors or consultants of
the Company are eligible to participate in the WRL Stock Plan. However, only employees of the Company are eligible to receive incentive stock options.

A maximum of 12,750,000 shares of Common Stock are reserved for issuance under the WRL Stock Plan. As of December 31, 2010, 4,107,378 shares remain available for the grant of stock options or
nonvested shares of Common Stock.

Wynn Macau, Limited Stock Incentive Plan

The Company’s majority-owned subsidiary Wynn Macau, Limited adopted a stock incentive plan effective September 16, 2009 (the
“WML Stock Plan”). The purpose of the WML Stock Plan is to reward participants, which may include directors and employees of Wynn Macau, Limited who have contributed towards enhancing the value of Wynn Macau and its shares. A maximum of
518.75 million shares have been reserved for issuance under the WML Stock Plan. As of December 31, 2010, 1 million options were outstanding.

Stock Options

Options are granted at the current market price at the date of grant. The WRL Stock Plan provides for a variety of vesting schedules all
determined at the time of grant. All options expire ten years from the date of grant.

A summary of option activity under the
WRL Stock Plan as of December 31, 2010, and the changes during the year then ended is presented below:

The following information is provided for stock options of the WRL Stock Plan (amounts in
thousand, except weighted average grant date fair value):

stock options, which is expected to be recognized over the vesting period of the related grants through May 2019.

Nonvested Shares

A summary of the status of the WRL Stock Plan’s nonvested shares as of December 31, 2010 and changes during the year then ended is presented below:



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following information is provided for nonvested stock of the WRL Stock Plan (amounts
in thousands, except weighted average grant date fair value):

Approximately $36.7 million of unamortized compensation cost relating to nonvested shares of Common Stock at
December 31, 2010 will be recognized as compensation over the vesting period of the related grants through December 2016.

Compensation Cost

The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the estimated fair value for each option grant issued, with highly subjective assumptions, changes in which could materially affect the
estimated fair value. Expected volatility is based on implied and historical factors related to the Company’s Common Stock. Expected term represents the weighted average time between the option’s grant date and its exercise date. The
Company uses the simplified method for companies with a limited trading history to estimate the expected term. The risk-free interest rate used for each period presented is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the period
equal to the expected term.

The fair values of stock options granted under the WRL Stock Plan were estimated on the date of
grant using the following weighted-average assumptions:

The fair value of the
1 million stock options granted under the WML Stock Plan on the date of grant was also estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model using the following assumptions:

The tax effects of significant temporary differences representing net deferred tax
assets and liabilities consisted of the following (amounts in thousands):



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The income tax provision (benefit) differs from that computed at the federal statutory
corporate tax rate as follows:

The Company has no U.S. tax loss carryforwards. The Company incurred foreign tax losses of $89.2 million,
$64.6 million, and $124 million during the tax years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. These foreign tax loss carryforwards expire in 2013, 2012, and 2011. During 2010, the Company increased its valuation allowance for
these tax loss carryforwards such that these foreign tax loss carryforwards are fully reserved. The Company recorded tax benefits resulting from the exercise of nonqualified stock options and the value of vested restricted stock of $10.5 million,
$49 million, and $0 as of December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, in excess of the amounts reported for such items as compensation costs under accounting standards related to stock-based compensation. The Company uses a
with-and-without approach to determine if the excess tax deductions associated with compensation costs have reduced income taxes payable.

Accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. During 2010 and 2009,
the aggregate valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by $574.2 million and $69.1 million, respectively. The 2010 and 2009 increases are primarily related to foreign tax credit carryforwards that are not considered more likely than not
realizable. As discussed in the succeeding paragraph, the Company does not consider forecasted future operating results when scheduling the realization of deferred tax assets and the required valuation allowance but instead relies solely on the
reversal of net taxable temporary differences. The ultimate realization of the Company’s recorded foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is dependent upon the incurrence of sufficient US income tax liabilities attributable to foreign source
income during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryover period.

The Macau special gaming tax is 35% of gross gaming revenue.
The U.S. taxing regime only allows a credit for 35% of “net” foreign source income. In determining the valuation allowance in accordance with accounting standards, due to the significant U.S. operating losses, the Company currently could
not rely on forecasted future U.S. taxable income. Instead, the valuation allowance was determined by scheduling the existing U.S. “net” taxable temporary differences that were expected to reverse during the 10-year foreign tax credit
carryover period and then applying U.S. income tax rules applicable to foreign tax credit utilization to the results in order to determine the amount of foreign tax credit expected to be utilized in the future.



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company completed a study of the
taxes, levies and obligations assessed on operations of Wynn Macau under Macau law and the Macau Gaming Concession. The study concluded the Macau Special Gaming Tax more likely than not qualified as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax under the
Internal Revenue Code. In February 2010, the Company and the IRS entered into a Pre-Filing Agreement (“PFA”) providing that the Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax and could be claimed as a U.S.
foreign tax credit.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized tax benefits of
$955.2 million, $125.3 million and $722 million (net of valuation allowance increases) for foreign tax credits applicable to the earnings of Wynn Macau S.A. A significant portion of these credits result from the treatment of the Macau Special Gaming
Tax as a U.S. foreign tax credit. Of the $955.2 million, $125.3 million and $722 million, $949.5 million, $121.5 million and $650.6 million were used to offset 2010, 2009 and 2008 U.S. income tax expense incurred as a result of the repatriation of
Wynn Macau S.A. earnings and (in 2010 and 2009) the Wynn Macau Limited IPO proceeds. The remaining $5.8 million, $3.8 million and $71.4 million (net of valuation allowance) were recorded as a deferred tax asset. Of the Company’s foreign tax
credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2010 of $1.307 billion before valuation allowance, $665.7 million will expire in 2018, $110.9 million will expire in 2019 and $530.4 million in 2020.

Of the December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 U.S. valuation allowances of $1.254 billion, $694.5 million and $632 million, $1.246
billion, $689.4 million and $626.9 million relate to U.S. foreign tax credits expected to expire unutilized, $1.3 million, $0 and $0 represent stock-based compensation for foreign based services that may be nondeductible, $2.7 million, $1.3 million
and $1.3 million represent stock-based compensation that may be nondeductible under IRC §162(m), and $3.8 million is attributable to syndication costs. Subsequent recognition of income tax benefits associated with syndication costs will be
allocated to additional paid-in capital.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company has not provided deferred U.S.
income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $325.1 million and $358.2 million resulting from earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which exceed U.S. tax earnings and profits. These amounts in excess
thereof are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability without regard to potential foreign tax credits associated with these temporary differences is approximately $113.8 million and $125.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no earnings in foreign subsidiaries that were considered permanently reinvested. Deferred income taxes are provided for foreign earnings planned
for repatriation. In connection with the Wynn Macau Limited IPO in 2009 (Note 13), the Company recorded a deferred tax liability net of expected foreign tax credits of $56.1 million to the extent that the book basis of the investment exceeded the
tax basis and where that difference was expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The deferred tax liability was recorded as a reduction in additional paid-in capital. In 2009, the Company repatriated $400 million from the Wynn Macau Limited
IPO proceeds leaving a deferred tax liability net of expected foreign tax credits of $41.5 million as of December 31, 2009. During 2010 the Company repatriated an additional $1.143 billion of Wynn Macau, Limited IPO proceeds resulting in the
reversal of the $41.5 million deferred tax liability. The amounts repatriated during 2010 and 2009 were used to fund domestic operations, to provide additional U.S. liquidity, and to fund dividends to the Company’s shareholders. During 2008,
the Company repatriated $1.071 billion in earnings from Wynn Macau. The 2008 earnings were repatriated to fund the repurchase of $625 million in principal of the Term Loan Facility, to provide available funding for possible future debt repurchases,
to provide funding for the completion of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, and to provide liquidity.

Effective September 6,
2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received a 5-year exemption from Macau’s 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, the Company was exempted from the payment of $64.4 million, $31.7 million, and $27.7 million in such taxes for the
years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

2008, respectively. The Company’s non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and its casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in
accordance with its concession agreement. On October 21, 2010, Wynn Resorts (Macau), S.A. applied for an additional 5-year exemption from Macau’s 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. On November 30, 2010 the request for an
additional 5-year Complementary Tax exemption was approved, thereby exempting the casino gaming profits of Wynn Macau S.A. through December 31, 2015.

In June 2009, Wynn Macau, S.A. entered into an agreement with the Macau Special Administrative Region that provides for an annual payment of MOP $7.2 million (approximately $900,000 US dollars) to the
Macau Special Administrative Region as complementary tax otherwise due by shareholders of Wynn Macau S.A. on dividend distributions. This agreement is effective as of 2006. Therefore, included in the tax provision for the year ended
December 31, 2009, are the amounts related to the years 2006 through 2009 totaling $3.6 million. This agreement on dividends is effective through 2010. On November 3, 2010, Wynn Macau, S.A. applied for an extension of this agreement for an
additional five years through December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2010, the request was still being processed by the Macau government.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the accounting standards related to accounting for uncertain tax positions. This standard requires that tax positions be assessed using a two-step
process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold, and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at
each balance sheet date. Liabilities recorded as a result of this analysis must generally be recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (amounts in thousands):

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company has recorded a liability related to uncertain tax
positions of $35.9 million and $90.3 million, respectively. These amounts are included in Other Long Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, $48 million and $58 million,
respectively, of liabilities related to U.S. and foreign uncertain tax positions that increase the NOL and foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax assets are classified as reductions of the NOL and foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax
assets in the net deferred tax asset and liability table above. Other uncertain tax positions not increasing the NOL and foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax assets have been recorded as increases in the liability for uncertain tax
positions.



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, $17.9 million and $16.6 million, respectively, of
unrecognized tax benefit would, if recognized, impact the effective tax rate. If incurred, the Company would recognize penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the years ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized no interest or penalties.

The Company’s unrecognized tax
benefits include certain income tax accounting methods. These accounting methods govern the timing and deductibility of income tax deductions. As a result, the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits could increase by a range of $0 to $8
million over the next 12 months.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various states and
foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities in the locations where it operates. As of December 31, 2010, the Company has filed domestic income tax returns for the
years 2002 to 2009 and foreign income tax returns for 2002 to 2009. The Company’s 2002 to 2009 domestic income tax returns remain subject to examination by the IRS and the Company’s 2006 to 2009 Macau income tax returns remain subject to
examination by the Macau Finance Bureau.

During 2010, the Company reached an agreement with the Appellate division of the IRS
regarding issues raised during the examination of its 2004 and 2005 income tax returns. The issues for consideration by the Appellate division were temporary differences and related to the deduction of certain costs incurred during the development
and construction of Wynn Las Vegas and the appropriate tax depreciation recovery periods applicable to certain assets. As a result of this settlement with the Appellate division, the Company reduced its unrecognized tax benefits by $78.4 million.
This reduction in unrecognized tax benefits resulted in a decrease in the Company’s liability for uncertain tax positions of $55 million. The settlement of the 2004 and 2005 examination issues did not result in a cash tax payment but rather
utilized $88.5 million and $2.5 million in foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards. The statute of limitations for the 2004 and 2005 U.S. income tax returns have been extended to September 30, 2011.

During 2010, the Company received the results of an IRS examination of its 2006 through and 2008 U.S. income tax returns and filed its
appeal of the examination’s findings with the Appellate division of the IRS. In connection with that appeal, the Company agreed to extend the statute of limitations for its 2006 and 2007 tax returns to December 31, 2011. The Company
believes that it will likely reach an agreement with the IRS with respect to the examination of its 2006, 2007 and 2008 U.S. income tax returns within the next 12 months. The issues under examination in these years are temporary differences and
relate to the treatment of discounts extended to Las Vegas casino customers gambling on credit, the deduction of certain costs incurred during the development and construction of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas and the appropriate tax depreciation recovery
periods applicable to certain assets. Upon the settlement of these issues, unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $0 to $54 million. The resolution of the 2006, 2007 and 2008 examination is not expected to result in any significant cash payment
but rather the utilization of a portion of the foreign tax credit carryforward.

During 2010, the Macau Finance Bureau
commenced an examination of the 2006 and 2007 Macau income tax returns filed by Wynn Macau S.A. The Company believes that the examination of the 2006 Macau tax return will likely conclude within the next 12 months; however, the Company is unable to
provide a summary of the likely examination issues or the impact on unrecognized tax benefits. As of December 31, 2010, no significant issues have been brought to the Company’s attention and it believes that its liability for uncertain tax
positions recorded by Wynn Macau S.A. is adequate with respect to these years.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, the IRS
commenced an examination of the Company’s 2009 U.S. income tax return. Since the examination is in its initial stages the Company is unable to determine if it will conclude



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

within the next twelve months. The Company believes that its liability for uncertain tax positions related to the period covered by the examination is adequate. The resolution of the 2009 IRS
examination is not expected to result in any significant cash payment, but rather the utilization of a portion of the 2009 foreign tax credit carryforward.

In January 2011, the Company received notification that it had been accepted into the IRS Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”) for the 2011 tax year. Under the CAP program the IRS agents and the
taxpayer work together in a pre-filing environment to examine transactions and issues and thus complete the tax examination before the tax return is filed. Entrance into this program should enable the Company to reduce time spent on tax
administration and enhance tax reserve and financial statement reporting integrity.

16. Commitments and Contingencies

Wynn Macau

Land Concession Contract.

Wynn Macau, S.A.
has entered into a land concession contract for the land on which Wynn Macau is located. Under the land concession contract, Wynn Macau, S.A. leases a parcel of approximately 16 acres from the government for an initial term of 25 years, with a right
to renew for additional periods with government approval. Wynn Macau, S.A. has made payments to the Macau government under the land concession contract totaling $42.7 million. Wynn Macau, S.A. also paid approximately $18.4 million to an unrelated
third party for its relinquishment of rights to a portion of the land. In 2009, the Company and the Macau government agreed to modify this land concession as a result of the construction of Encore at Wynn Macau and the additional square footage that
was added as a result of such construction. In November 2009, the Company made an additional one-time land premium payment of $14.2 million. During the term of the land concession contract, Wynn Macau, S.A. is required to make annual lease payments
of up to $525,000.

Cotai Land Agreement.

On August 1, 2008, subsidiaries of Wynn Resorts, Limited entered
into an agreement with an unrelated third party to make a one-time payment in the amount of $50 million in consideration of the unrelated third party’s relinquishment of certain rights with respect to any future development on the 52 acres of
land in the Cotai area of Macau. The payment will be made within 15 days after the Government of the Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China publishes the Company’s rights to the land in the government’s
official gazette. The Company has filed an application for the land with the government of Macau and is awaiting final approval.

Aircraft Deposits

The Company made deposits on three aircraft
purchases totaling $19.4 million. The Company was scheduled to take delivery of those aircraft in 2009, 2012 and 2017 with additional payments to be made totaling $142.2 million. On February 19, 2009, the Company cancelled the agreements to
purchase two of these aircraft. In connection with the cancellation the Company wrote-off $6.8 million of the deposits, net of amounts refunded. The delivery date for the third aircraft is scheduled for June 2012, and as of December 31, 2010,
the Company has made deposits of $8 million toward the purchase of this aircraft, with additional payments to be made totaling $49.3 million.

Leases and other arrangements

The Company is the lessor under
several retail leases and has entered into license and distribution agreements for several additional retail outlets. The Company also is a party to joint venture agreements for the operation of one retail outlet and the Ferrari and Maserati
automobile dealership at Wynn Las Vegas.

The following table presents the future minimum rentals to be received under the
operating leases (amounts in thousands):

In addition, the Company is the lessee under leases for office space in Las Vegas, Macau and certain other
locations, warehouse facilities, the land underlying the Company’s aircraft hangar and certain office equipment.

At
December 31, 2010, the Company was obligated under non-cancelable operating leases to make future minimum lease payments as follows (amounts in thousands):

Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, was $24.4 million, $17.2 million and
$17.8 million, respectively.

Self-insurance

The Company’s domestic subsidiaries are covered under a self-insured medical plan up to a maximum of $300,000 per year for each
insured person. Amounts in excess of these thresholds are covered by the Company’s insurance programs, subject to customary policy limits. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries are fully-insured.

Employment Agreements

The Company has entered into employment agreements with several executive officers, other members of management and certain key employees. These agreements generally have three- to five-year terms and
typically indicate a base salary and often contain provisions for discretionary bonuses. Certain of the executives are also entitled to a separation payment if terminated without “cause” or upon voluntary termination of employment for
“good reason” following a “change of control” (as these terms are defined in the employment contracts).

Litigation

On May 3, 2010, Atlantic-Pacific Capital, Inc. (“APC”) filed an arbitration demand with Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Services regarding an agreement with the Company. The action concerns a claim for compensation of approximately $32 million pursuant to an agreement entered into between APC and the Company on or about March 30, 2008 whereby APC was engaged to
raise equity capital for an investment vehicle sponsored by the Company. APC is seeking compensation unrelated to the investment vehicle. The Company has denied APC’s claims for compensation. The Company filed a Complaint for Damages and
Declaratory Relief against APC in the District Court, Clark County, Nevada, on May 10, 2010. APC removed the action to the United States District Court, District of Nevada. Management believes that APC’s claim against the Company is
without merit and intends to defend this matter vigorously.

Sales and Use Tax on Complimentary Meals

In March 2008, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled, in the matter captioned

Sparks Nugget, Inc. vs. The State of Nevada
Ex Rel. Department of Taxation

, that food and non-alcoholic beverages purchased for use in providing complimentary meals to customers and to employees was exempt from sales and use tax. In July 2008, the Court denied the State’s motion for
rehearing. Through April 2008, Wynn Las Vegas has paid use tax on these items and has filed for refunds for the periods from April 2005 to April 2008. The amount subject to these refunds is $5.4 million. Due to the uncertainty surrounding this
matter, a receivable has not been recorded as of December 31, 2010.

17. Segment Information

The Company monitors its operations and evaluates earnings by reviewing the assets and operations of Wynn Las Vegas (including Encore at Wynn Las Vegas) and Wynn Macau (including Encore at Wynn Macau).
The Company’s total assets and capital expenditures by segment consisted of the following (amounts in thousands):



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company’s results of operations by segment for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 consisted of the following (amounts in thousands):

(1)

Encore at Wynn Las Vegas opened December 22, 2008 and is included with Wynn Las Vegas as the two properties operate as one segment. Encore at Wynn Macau opened
April 21, 2010 and is included with Wynn Macau as the two properties operate as one segment.

(2)

“Adjusted Property EBITDA” is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other,
corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating income and expenses and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted Property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management
believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating
performance of its properties with those of its competitors. The Company also presents Adjusted Property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company’s ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures
and meet working capital requirements. Gaming



WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In order to view the
operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses, which do not relate
to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted Property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company’s performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating
activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted Property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current
or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in
Adjusted Property EBITDA. Also, Wynn Resorts’ calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

18. Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)

The following tables (amounts in thousands, except per share data) present selected quarterly financial information for 2010 and 2009, as previously reported. Because income (loss) per share amounts are
calculated using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per share amounts for the four quarters may not equal the total income per share amounts for the year.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

. The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in recording, processing,
summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act and in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely discussions regarding required
disclosure.

(b)

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Management of the Company is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2010, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial
reporting. This report appears under “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting” on page 66.

(c)

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our fourth fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation

The accompanying condensed financial statements include only the accounts of Wynn Resorts, Limited (the “Company”). Investments
in the Company’s subsidiaries are accounted for under the equity method.

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the developer, owner and operator of Wynn Macau, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Wynn Macau, Limited sold through an initial public offering,
including the over allotment, 1,437,500,000 (27.7%) shares of this subsidiary’s common stock.

Certain information
and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted since this information is included in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

2. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is a holding company and, as a result, its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its subsidiaries’ ability to provide
funds to it. Restrictions imposed by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s (a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company) debt instruments significantly restrict certain of the Company’s key subsidiaries holding a majority of the consolidated
group’s total assets, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, from making dividends or distributions to the Company, subject to certain exceptions for affiliated overhead expenses as defined in the agreements governing Wynn Las Vegas, LLC’s debt
instruments, unless certain financial and non-financial criteria have been satisfied. In addition, the terms of the loan agreement of Wynn Resorts (Macau), S.A. noted below contains similar restrictions. The Company received a cash dividend of $1.51
billion from Wynn Group Asia in 2010. The Company received a cash dividend of $530 million from Wynn Group Asia in November 2009.

3.
Long-Term Debt

$1 Billion Term Loan

On June 21, 2007, the Company entered into a $1 billion term loan (the “Wynn Resorts Term Loan”). Borrowings under the Wynn Resorts Term Loan were available in the form of a delayed-draw
term loan facility available through December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had borrowed $1 billion under the Wynn Resorts Term Loan. The Wynn Resorts Term Loan was available to fund (a) the Company’s equity
repurchase program announced on June 7, 2007 and (b) up to $350 million for general corporate purposes.

On
August 1, 2008, the Company amended the Wynn Resorts Term Loan to allow Stephen A. Wynn, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to purchase an interest in the debt. On August 1, 2008, Mr. Wynn advised the Company
that he purchased $198,250,000 of the face amount of the outstanding debt under the Wynn Resorts Term Loan from a third party. On November 13, 2008, the Company further amended the Wynn Resorts Term Loan to purchase loans outstanding up to $650
million prior to March 31, 2009. On November 26, 2008, the Company purchased $625 million of loans under the Wynn Resorts Term Loan for $596.1 million, reflecting a discounted price of 95.375%. The loans purchased included the interests
held by Mr. Wynn. In connection with this transaction, the Company recognized a $22.3 million gain on early retirement of debt, net of the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs and fees during 2008.



In June 2009, the Company purchased and retired the remaining outstanding loans of $375
million under the Wynn Resorts Term Loan for $364.7 million, reflecting a discounted price of 97.25%. In connection with this transaction, the Company recognized an $8.8 million gain on early retirement of debt, net of the write-off of unamortized
debt issue cost during 2009.

4. Equity Repurchase Program

On June 6, 2007, the Board of Directors of Wynn Resorts authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.2 billion. On July 10, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized an increase of $500
million to the previously announced equity repurchase program bringing the total authorized to $1.7 billion. The repurchase program may include repurchases from time to time through open market purchases or negotiated transactions, depending upon
market conditions. No repurchases were made during the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased 10,915,633 shares for a net cost of $940.1 million. As of December 31,
2010, the Company had repurchased 12,804,954 shares of the Company’s common stock through open market purchases for a net cost of $1.1 billion, at an average cost of $87.42 per share.

5. Common Stock Secondary Offerings

On March 20, 2009, the Company
completed a secondary common stock offering of 11,040,000 shares with net proceeds of $202.3 million.

On November 18,
2008, the Company completed a secondary common stock offering of 8,000,000 shares with net proceeds of $344.3 million.

6. Noncontrolling
Interest

In October 2009, Wynn Macau, Limited, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the developer, owner
and operator of Wynn Macau, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Through an initial public offering, including the over allotment, Wynn Macau, Limited sold 1,437,500,000 (27.7%) shares of this
subsidiary’s common stock. Net proceeds to the Company as a result of this transaction were approximately $1.8 billion. The shares of Wynn Macau, Limited were not and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent a registration under the Securities Act, or an applicable exception from such registration requirements. In connection with this transaction, the Company
recorded $107.4 million of noncontrolling interest as a separate component of equity in the accompanying Condensed Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $156.5 million and $18.5 million
for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

On November 2, 2010, the Wynn Macau, Limited Board of
Directors approved a HK$0.76 per share dividend. The total dividend amount was US $508 million and the Company’s share of this dividend was $367 million. A reduction of $140.7 million was made to noncontrolling interest in the accompanying
Condensed Balance Sheets to reflect this dividend.
