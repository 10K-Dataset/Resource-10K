Item 1. Business

The Company

Zebra Technologies Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Company or Zebra) design, manufacture and support a broad range of direct thermal and
thermal transfer bar code label and
receipt printers, plastic card printers, related accessories and support software. The Company markets its products worldwide principally to manufacturing and service organizations and governments for
use in applications for automatic identification, data collection and personal identification.

The
Company's equipment is designed to operate at the user's location or on a mobile basis to produce and dispense high-quality labels and plastic cards in
time-sensitive applications and under a variety of environmental conditions. Applications for the Company's products are extremely diverse, primarily in the areas of routing and tracking,
transactions processing, and identification and authentication. They include applications where barcoding is used to identify or track objects or information, particularly in situations that require
high levels of data accuracy and where speed and reliability are critical. They also include specialty printing for receipts and tickets where improved customer service and productivity gains may be
the primary reason for printing, rather than a barcoding application. Plastic cards are used for secure, reliable personal identification or access control often on an on-demand basis.

Applications
for the Company's technology span virtually all industries and geographies. They include, but are not limited to, inventory control, small package delivery, baggage
handling, automated warehousing, JIT (Just-In-Time) manufacturing, employee time and attendance records, file management systems, hospital information systems, medical specimen
labeling, shop floor control, in-store product labeling, employee ID cards, driver's licenses, and access control systems. As of December 31, 2002, management estimates that almost
3,000,000 Zebra printers were installed in approximately 100 countries throughout the world.

The
Company believes competitive forces on businesses worldwide to strengthen security, reduce costs, improve quality, improve customer service, and increase productivity support the
growth of its bar code labeling solutions and specialty printing business. Industry-mandated standardization for


compliance labeling is an important catalyst in the deployment of bar code systems. Zebra further believes that companies are also adopting automatic identification systems incorporating barcoding
for business improvement applications. Many of these applications make increasing use of enterprise-wide resource planning (ERP) and other process improvement systems in manufacturing and
service organizations. The Company believes that greater emphasis on supply chain management, the drive to reduce errors in health care, and heightened concern over safety and security will lead to
increased use of automatic identification systems. Still other applications are taking advantage of recent advances in wireless and hand-held computing technologies.

Concern
for safety and security and personal identification contribute to demand for the Company's card printer products. This concern has heightened interest in systems that provide
personal identification and access control, including secure ID systems for driver's licenses, employee and visitor badges, national identification cards, event passes, club membership cards, and
keyless entry systems.

On
October 28, 1998, the Company merged with Eltron International, Inc., which manufactured and marketed high-quality, low-cost direct thermal and
thermal transfer bar code label printers, card printers,
ribbons, self-adhesive labels and related accessories. Financial results for the Company for the periods prior to the merger were restated to reflect the merger as a
pooling-of-interests transaction.

On
April 3, 2000, Zebra acquired Comtec Information Systems, Inc. for $88,476,000 in cash. Located in Warwick, Rhode Island, Comtec was a privately held company that
designed, manufactured and supported a complete line of mobile wireless thermal printing solutions. Since the acquisition, the Company consolidated all mobile printing systems under the
Zebra® brand.

The
Company completed its initial public offering in August 1991. Zebra is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and its principal offices are located at 333
Corporate Woods Parkway, Vernon Hills, Illinois 60061. The Company's telephone number is (847) 634-6700 and its internet web site address is

WWW.ZEBRA.COM

. All of the Company's filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission are available free of charge through the Investor page on this
web site, immediately upon filing.

Products

The Company's products consist of a broad line of computerized printers for the production of bar code labels, receipts and tags, and plastic cards, specialty bar
code labeling materials, ink ribbons for bar code and card printers, and bar code label design software. These products are used to provide bar code labeling, personal identification, and specialty
printing solutions principally in the manufacturing, retail, service, and government sectors of the economy. The Company's equipment and supplies are designed to operate at the user's location under a
variety of work environments. The Company works closely with distributors, resellers and end users of its products to design and implement labeling solutions that meet the technical demands of the end
user. To achieve this flexibility, the Company provides its customers with a broad selection of printer models, each of which can be configured for a specific application. Additionally, the Company
will select and, if necessary, create appropriate labeling stock, ink ribbons and adhesives to suit a particular application. In-house engineering personnel in software, mechanical,
electronic and chemical engineering participate in the creation and development of bar code labeling solutions for particular applications.

Bar
Code Label and Receipt Printers

Zebra
markets its line of bar code label and receipt printers under the Zebra brand. The Company produces the industry's broadest range of on-demand thermal transfer and
direct thermal bar code label printers. Zebra's printing systems include hundreds of optional configurations that can be selected to meet particular customer needs. The Company believes this breadth
of product is a unique and


significant competitive strength, because it allows the Company to satisfy the wide variety of printing applications in its target market.

The
Company offers 40 bar code printer models. At December 31, 2002, the Company's main printer product offerings were as follows:

Performance Tabletop Printers.

At the high end of the label printer market, Zebra produces printers targeted at applications
requiring continuous operation in high output, mission-critical settings. These units provide a wide variety of optional configurations, features, print widths, speeds and dot densities, including the
industry's only standard 600-dpi printer. The Company offers five Zebra models under its XiIII Plus Series line. List prices range from $4,295 to $7,495.

Zebra
also manufactures and markets the R-140 and R402 Printer/Encoder. The R-140 and R402 print and encode "smart labels," which are printable labels embedded
with an ultra-thin radio frequency transponder, in a single pass. Information encoded in these transponders can then be read and modified by a radio frequency reader. The R-140
and R402 are targeted at the developing market for radio frequency identification (RFID), where line-of-sight reading or scanning a label may not be possible and appending
information to the label is important. List prices are $5,695 for the R-140 and $1,695 for the R402.

Mid-Range Tabletop Printers.

The Company offers seven printer models designed for less demanding applications.
These units offer fewer option configurations and features for a commensurate lower price. Products in this category consist of the Zebra Stripe®, S and Z Series as well as the TLP 2746
and LP/TLP 2684 (Strata) printers. List prices range from $1,395 to $2,995.

Desktop Printers.

Applications with low volume suit the Company's desktop printers. Zebra currently offers nine desktop
models consisting of the Ht-146, DA402, T402, LP/TLP 2844, LP 2824, LP 2443 (Orion®), LP/TLP 2722, LP/TLP 2742, and TLP 3742 printers. List prices range from $395 to $995.

Mobile Printing Solutions.

The Company offers 15 mobile printer models, which provide durability, light weight and wireless
connectivity interfaces. These printers print in 2-, 3- and 4-inch widths and are marketed under the Cameo, Encore, QL and PA/PT lines. List prices range from $575
to $1,825.

Print Engines.

Zebra's 170PAX3 and 110PAX3 print engines are targeted at manufacturers of high-speed automatic
label applicator systems. List prices range from $3,200 to $4,250.

In
addition to their use in on-demand automatic identification applications, the Company's bar code label printers can also be used to meet customers' needs for
on-site production of small or large quantities of custom bar code labels and other graphics. This capability results in shorter lead times, reduced inventory and more flexibility than can
be provided with traditional off-site printing. Management believes that of the major printing technologies, which include ink jet, laser and impact
dot matrix, direct thermal and thermal transfer are best suited for most bar code labeling applications. Thermal transfer printing produces dark, solid blacks and sharply defined lines that are
important for printing readily scannable bar codes. These images can be printed on a wide variety of labeling materials, which enable users to affix bar code labels to virtually any object. This
capability is very important in the industrial and service markets served by the Company. Direct thermal printing is best suited where simplicity, light weight and cost are important factors in the
application. Accordingly, this technology is found principally in the Company's wireless and desktop units.

Plastic
Card Printers

The
Company offers seven card printers. Uses for plastic cards printed by these systems include national identity cards, driver's licenses, employee identification badges, smart cards,
on-demand access control cards, and customer loyalty card applications. Users can select from a number of printer


options, including monochrome and color printing, single- and two-sided printing, lamination, and magnetic stripe and smart card encoding. The Company's P205, P210, P310, P320i, P420,
P520 and P720 plastic card printers are marketed under the Eltron® brand. List prices range from $1,695 to $9,995.

Sales
of hardware (bar code and plastic card printers and replacement parts) totaled $360,185,000 in 2002, $339,895,000 in 2001, and $378,093,000 in 2000. These sales represented 75.7%,
75.6%, and 78.5% of net sales in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

Supplies

The
Company sells supplies, which consist of stock and customized thermal labels and tags, plastic cards, card laminates, and thermal transfer ribbons, to both new and current users of
its label and plastic card printing systems worldwide. Zebra promotes the use of genuine Zebra brand supplies with its equipment.

Zebra
fully supports its printers, resellers and end users with an extensive line of superior quality, high performance supplies optimized to a particular user's needs. Supplies are
chosen in consultation with the reseller and end user based on the specific application, printer and environment in which the labeling system must perform. In the case of bar code labeling solutions,
the Company's supplies also include proprietary ribbon and label formulations developed according to the Company's specifications and designed to maximize printer performance and meet the most
demanding end user performance criteria. Factors such as adhesion, resistance to scratches, smudges and abrasion and chemical and environmental exposures are all taken into account when selecting the
type of ribbon and labeling materials. The use of supplies that are not carefully matched to specific printers can adversely affect printer performance in terms of print speed, and print quality.

Sales
of the Company's supplies were $87,981,000 in 2002, $85,266,000 in 2001, and $81,045,000 in 2000 and represented 18.5%, 18.9%, and 16.8% of net sales, respectively.

Software

The
Company offers high-performance label design and integration software specifically designed to optimize the performance of Zebra bar code label printers. Known as
BAR-ONE®, this software provides the capability to design and integrate sophisticated labels from standalone or legacy applications through a powerful,
easy-to-use Windows® interface.

The
Company's goal is to provide software that enables high levels of connectivity to all major computer network and software systems. These networks include Ethernet, 802.11 and
Bluetooth™ wireless systems and various IBM® systems. Software systems include SAP® and other ERP systems, warehouse management systems (WMS), Windows,
Unix® and Linux®. Under an agreement with Accelio Corporation, a provider of electronic forms, workflow and output management software applications, Zebra offers
BAR-ONE with Accelio Present Central® (formerly JetForm Central™). This software package enables Zebra printers to receive output directly from many of the popular
software packages on the market, including the increasingly used ERP software, without the need to write costly software interfaces. Zebra also offers a BAR-ONE for SAP/R3, which enables
users of the SAP/R3 ERP system to print directly to Zebra printers without the need for middleware. To expand the global applications for its software and printers, the Company is developing
multi-lingual capabilities in its software and user interfaces.

The
goal of improving connectivity has also led to the development and introduction of ZebraLink. This multi-purpose software tool gives users the ability to set up and control Zebra
printers remotely using Web-enabled devices. It also enables Zebra printers to provide real-time printer error and status notification via e-mail to a wired or
wireless device. In addition, ZebraLink's programming language, ZBI, can be used to control and interpret incoming text and data streams. ZBI gives users the ability to


configure Zebra printers to interpret various non-Zebra printer based languages, as well as to set up operations in which a bar code label printer is needed and eliminate a computer
hook-up.

Maintenance
Services

For
bar code label and receipt printers, the Company provides service at depot repair centers at its Vernon Hills, Illinois, Camarillo, California, Warwick, Rhode Island, and Preston,
U.K. facilities as well as at its Zebra Authorized Service Provider (ZASP) locations. In addition, IBM, Optimal Systems Services and National Service Center (NSC) provide on-site repair
services. The Company shares the
revenue for on-site service contracts sold by IBM, Optimal and NSC for Zebra printing systems installed in the United States, and with IBM in Europe. Outside of the United States, the
Company's distributors in each country provide maintenance service, either directly as ZASPs or through independent service agents. Zebra also provides service and technical support assistance from
in-house support personnel located in the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore, who are available by telephone hotline five days a week during regular business hours. Also, for
most Zebra products, the Company provides interactive technical support via the Internet, which can be accessed through the Company's Web site, http://www.zebra.com, 24 hours a day, seven days
a week.

The
card printer depot repair facilities are located in Camarillo, California and Varades, France, and IBM performs on-site repair services in the United States and Europe.
Card printer users can receive technical support assistance from in-house support personnel located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and France, who are available by
telephone during regular business hours. In addition, on-line support for card printers can be accessed through the Web site, http://www.eltroncards.com, 24 hours a day, seven days
a week.

Warranties

All
Zebra printing equipment is warranted against defects in material and workmanship for up to one year. Zebra supplies are warranted against defects in material and workmanship for
their stated shelf life or twelve months, whichever ends first. Defective equipment and supplies may be returned to the Company for repair, replacement or refund during the applicable warranty
periods.

The Company's Technology

The Company's products use thermal transfer, direct thermal and thermal die sublimation technologies. Each technology has characteristics that provide specific
benefits to the end user.

Thermal
transfer printing is used in all performance and some mid-range, desktop and portable bar code label printers, as well as the Company's high-speed print
engines. This technology creates an image by applying an electrically heated printhead to a ribbon that releases ink onto labeling/ticketing media. The benefits of thermal transfer printing include
superior image quality, the ability to print on a wide variety of smooth-surfaced materials, no requirement for specially coated or otherwise specially formulated labeling/ticketing media and the
ability to use inks that are not viable with alternative printing technologies.

Direct
thermal printing is used in some mid-range, desktop and portable printer products. Direct thermal printing creates an image by applying the heated printhead directly
to specially treated paper, which changes color when heated. Direct thermal technology is preferable where image durability is
less critical and where the application does not require specialty-labeling materials such as plastics or metal foils.

The
Company's plastic card printers incorporate thermal dye sublimation for color printing on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyester cards. This capability allows for the creation of
personalized full color, photographic quality plastic cards. These cards can typically be created in less than 30 seconds for under one dollar each. Traditional photographic processes are both more
expensive and time


consuming. The Company believes that personalized card applications such as driver's licenses, loyalty cards, school and work identification cards, security access cards and financial transaction
cards are well suited to this technology. Bar codes, smart chips and magnetic stripe encoding can be used to record such personal data as health records, financial transactions, security access codes
and vital statistics.

Zebra's
printing systems incorporate Company-designed computer hardware, electrical mechanisms and software, which operate the printing functions of the system and communicate with the
host computer. Zebra's bar code label printers operate using Zebra Programming Language (ZPL®), Zebra Programming Language II (ZPL II®), Eltron Programming Language (EPL) or
Comtec Printer Control Language (CPCL), each of which is a proprietary printer driver language. These languages are compatible with virtually all computer operating systems, including UNIX,
MS/DOS® and Windows.

The
Company guarantees backward compatibility in ZPL and ZPL II to allow users to replace older Zebra printers with newer equipment without costly reprogramming of label design programs.
This compatibility also allows users to operate multiple Zebra printers in different applications using standardized programs and to integrate these printers into a local area network. Management
believes that ZPL and ZPL II give the Company a competitive advantage by ensuring compatibility across a broad range of the Company's present and future printer products and by facilitating system
upgrades and customer loyalty to Zebra products. Some independent software vendors have written label preparation programs with ZPL and ZPL II drivers specifically for Zebra printers. ZPL and ZPL II
label format programs can be run on a personal computer with ordinary word processing programs, making ZPL and ZPL II particularly adaptable to PC-based systems.

Users
of Zebra's instant-issuance plastic card printers typically operate these printers with software programs designed and sold by independent vendors.

Sales and Marketing

Sales.

The Company sells its products in the United States and internationally through distributors, value-added resellers
(VARs), original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), international customers and directly to a small number of designated key accounts. For supplies, the Company also sells directly to end users through
the Internet and telemarketing operations. Distributors and VARs purchase, warehouse and sell a variety of automatic identification components from different manufacturers and customize systems for
end-user applications using their systems integration expertise. Because these sales channels provide specific software, configuration, installation, integration and support services
required by end users within various market segments, these relationships allow the Company to reach end users throughout the world in a wide variety of industries. The Company does not experience
significant seasonality.

The
Company classifies its direct VARs as either Premier Partners or Solution Partners, depending on the size and commitment to Zebra products of a particular VAR. In addition, Zebra
offers VARs the opportunity to earn certifications for mobile printers, supplies and service. The Company also sells through distributors, which in turn sell to smaller VARs who may be a part of the
Zebra Solutions Associate program. Both categories of VARs, as well as OEMs and systems integrators, provide customers with a variety of automatic identification components including scanners,
accessories, applications software and systems integration expertise, and, in the case of some OEMs, then resell the products under their own brands as part of their own product offering. The Company
believes that the breadth of this indirect channel network, both in terms of variety and geographic scope, enhances its ability to compete.

In
some instances, the Company may designate a customer of label and receipt printers as a key account when purchases of Company products reach specified levels. Zebra sales personnel,
either alone or together with the Company's distribution partners, manage these key accounts to ensure their needs, including consistent support for projects and applications, are being met.


Sales
to international customers comprised 43.2% of net sales in 2002, 40.0% of net sales in 2001, and 37.4% of net sales in 2000. The Company's products are distributed in about 100
countries throughout the world. Management believes that international sales have the long-term potential to grow faster than domestic sales because of the lower penetration of bar code
systems outside the United States. As a result, the Company has invested resources to support its international growth and currently operates facilities and sales offices, or has representation, in 18
different countries.

Marketing.

The Company's marketing operations include product management, marketing communications, training, market research
and channel marketing functions. The product management group initiates the development of new products and product enhancements and manages product introductions and positioning. The product
management group also focuses on strategic planning and market definition and analyzes the Company's competitive strengths and weaknesses.

The
marketing communications group operates as an internal advertising and public relations resource. This group, working with advertising agencies and contractors, creates
advertisements, and brochures, manages trade show exhibits, maintains the Company's Web sites, and places articles highlighting applications of Zebra products in trade and industry publications.

The
Company's market research group is a strategic planning, research-oriented group that focuses on market definition and analysis of the Company's relative competitive strengths and
weaknesses. This group identifies and analyzes market opportunities for current, planned and potential products and gathers and analyzes competitive and market information.

The
channel marketing group is responsible for the development of new market opportunities and relationships with key customers, vendors and government regulatory and industry standards
committees. This group also prepares speeches, application training programs and seminars, which are presented around the world to industry and customer groups.

Customers

The Company estimates that almost 3,000,000 bar code label and plastic card printers were installed in approximately 100 countries as of December 31, 2002.

Sales
to ScanSource, Inc. accounted for 13.6% of net sales in 2002. No customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales in 2001 or 2000.

Production and Manufacturing

The Company's strategy is to produce designs that optimize product performance, quality, reliability, durability and versatility. These designs use
cost-efficient materials, sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship. The Company has pursued a manufacturing strategy of control over the manufacture of its hardware
products by developing in-house capability to produce mechanical and electronic assemblies, and it has designed many of its own tools, fixtures and test equipment. The Company's
manufacturing engineers are dedicated to co-engineering new products in coordination with Zebra's new product engineers and vendors. This collaborative effort increases manufacturing
efficiency by specifying and designing manufacturing processes and facilities simultaneously with product design.

The
Company purchases prefabricated component parts and subassemblies for use in the manufacture of its products. Critical subassemblies include printheads, power supplies, integrated
circuits, and stepper motors, which are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers at competitive prices. The Company's purchase contracts provide for price increases in the event of certain
increases in the costs
of raw materials. The Company maintains multiple sources for its component parts and subassemblies to mitigate against risks of parts shortages or unavailability. The Company does not believe at this
time that it faces difficulties in obtaining an adequate supply of these materials.


Research and Development

The Company had research and development expenditures of $29,210,000 in 2002, $28,184,000 in 2001, and $26,746,000 in 2000. These expenditures amounted to 6.1%,
6.3%, and 5.6% of net sales for the corresponding periods. The Company devotes significant resources to developing new printing solutions for its target markets and ensuring that the Company's
products maintain high levels of reliability and efficient manufacturing.

Competition

Many companies are engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of bar code label printers and card personalization solutions. The Company considers its
direct competition in bar code label and receipt printing to be producers of on-demand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printing systems and supplies. The Company also competes
with companies engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of printing systems that use alternative technologies, such as impact dot matrix, ink-jet and laser printing. Similarly, the
Company competes with manufacturers of card personalization systems that are based on a broad range of alternative, competing technologies.

Management
believes that the ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors. These factors include the reliability, quality and reputation of the manufacturer and its
products; hardware innovations and specifications; breadth of product offerings; information systems connectivity; price; level of technical support; supplies and applications support offered by the
manufacturer; available distribution channels; and financial resources to support new product design and innovation. The Company believes that it presently competes favorably with respect to these
factors.

No
single competitor competes across the entire breadth of the Company's product line. The Company, however, faces significant competition in each of its product segments. For
low-cost desktop label printer products, the Company's principal competitors are Cognitive Solutions, a subsidiary of Axiohm Transaction Solutions, Inc.; Tokyo Electric Company
(TEC); Taiwan Semiconductor; Microcom; and Datamax Corporation. In the mid-range printer market, the Company's principal competitors are Datamax; UBI and Intermec Corporations,
subsidiaries of Unova, Inc.; Monarch Marking Systems, a subsidiary of Paxar, Inc.; Sato; and TEC. Principal competition in the high end of the market derives from Sato; TEC;
Printronix, Inc.; and Intermec. For print engines, the Company's principal competitor is Sato. For portable printers, the Company's principal competitors are Monarch Marking Systems and
O'Neil Product Development, Inc. The potential for greater competition is increasing, in the Company's opinion, as companies view mobile printing applications to be an attractive market.

The
Company has several competitors in the worldwide market for card personalization equipment using dye sublimation technology. These competitors include Nisca, Datacard, Inc.,
Fargo Electronics, Inc., ColorX, Atlantek, Polaroid, MagiCard, Evolis, LogickaComp, Printherm, CIM, NBS, Matica, Song Woo Electronics, and Victor Data Systems.

Dye-sublimation,
the technology incorporated in the Company's card printers, is only one of several commercially available types of equipment used to personalize cards. The
Company also competes with companies that produce identification cards using alternative technologies, which include ink-jet, thermal transfer, embossing, film-based systems,
encoders, laser engraving and large-scale dye-sublimation printers. These card personalization technologies offer viable alternatives to the Company's card printers and provide effective
competition from a variety of companies, many of which are substantially larger than the Company, including Canon Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, Hitachi Ltd., and Lexmark
International, Inc. In addition, service bureaus compete for end user business and provide an alternative to the purchase of the Company's card printing equipment and supplies.


Alternative Technologies

The Company believes that direct thermal and thermal transfer printing will be the label and receipt printer technology of choice in Zebra's target markets for
the foreseeable future. Among the many advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing is the ability to print high-resolution, durable images on a wide variety of label
materials at relatively low costs and very high speeds compared with alternative printing technologies. The Company continually assesses competitive and complementary methods of bar code printing and
automatic identification. These technologies include ink jet, laser, impact dot matrix, laser etching, and RFID. Currently, the Company believes that direct thermal and thermal transfer print
technologies provide the best low-cost, high quality printing solution for its label and receipt printer target markets.

Although
there is no assurance that a new technology will not supplant direct thermal and thermal transfer printing for bar code labels and receipts, the Company is not aware of any
developing technology that offers the advantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer printing for the Company's label and receipt printer target markets. To complement its thermal printing
technology, Zebra produces the R-140 and R402 printer/encoders for printing and encoding "smart labels," which are printable labels embedded with an ultra-thin radio frequency
transponder. Information encoded in these transponders can then be read and modified by a radio frequency reader. The R-140 and R402 are targeted at the developing market for RFID, where
line-of-sight reading or scanning a label may not be possible. The Company views RFID as a complementary technology to barcoding, offering growth opportunities to Zebra as the
technology becomes more widely adopted.

If
other technologies were to evolve or become available to the Company, it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into the Company's products. Alternatively, if such
technologies were to evolve or become available to the Company's competitors, the Company's products may become obsolete, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Intellectual Property Rights

Zebra relies on a combination of trade secrets, patents, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws and contractual rights to establish and
protect its proprietary rights in its products. The Company holds and actively protects a number of trademarks, which are registered domestically and internationally. The Company holds 68 patents and
has 21 patents pending pertaining to its products. The duration of these patents ranges from 14 to 20 years. The expiration of any individual patent would not have a material impact on the
Company's business.

Despite
the Company's efforts to protect its intellectual property rights, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of the Company's products or to reverse
engineer or otherwise obtain and use some technology and information that the Company regards as proprietary. Moreover, the laws of some countries do not afford the same protection to the Company's
proprietary rights as do United States laws. There can be no assurance that legal protections relied upon by the Company to protect its proprietary position will be adequate. While the Company's
intellectual property is valuable and provides the Company with certain competitive advantages, the Company does not believe that the legal protections afforded to its intellectual property are
fundamental to the Company's success.

Employees

As of February 28, 2003, the Company employed approximately 2,000 persons. None of these employees is a member of a union. The Company considers its
relationship with its employees to be very good.


Item 2. Properties

The Company's corporate headquarters are located in Vernon Hills, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago. The Company conducts its operations from a
custom-designed facility at this location, which provides approximately 225,000 square feet of space. Approximately 113,000 square feet have been allocated to office and laboratory functions and
112,000 square feet to manufacturing and warehousing. This facility was constructed in 1989 and expanded in 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1999. It is owned and leased to the Company, under a lease terminating
on June 30, 2014, by Unique Building Corporation, a corporation owned in part by Edward Kaplan and Gerhard Cless, both executive officers and directors of the Company.

During
1999, the Company consolidated some United Kingdom facilities by moving distribution from the Company's Wokingham and High Wycombe facilities to the Preston location, and
transferring Wokingham associates to the renovated High Wycombe location. The vacant Wokingham facility totals 27,000 square feet and has a lease that expires in October 2010. The Company has
sub-leased this property through October 2003.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

On January 31, 2003, a Writ of Summons was filed in the Nantes Commercial Court, Nantes, France, by Printherm, a French corporation, and several of its
shareholders (collectively, "Printherm"), against Zebra Technologies France, a French corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Printherm seeks damages in the amount
€15, 304,000 and additional unspecified
damages in connection with Zebra France's termination of negotiations in December 2000 with respect to the proposed acquisition by the Company of the capital stock of Printherm. The Company
believes that Printherm's claims are without merit, and the Company will vigorously defend the action.

The
Company also is litigating a dispute over a 1998 tax assessment in the amount of approximately $2,000,000, including penalties and interest, with the Illinois Department of Revenue
for the years 1993 through 1995. The case was filed by the Company in the District Court of Illinois and tried during November 2000. The decision from the court was unfavorable to the Company
but has been appealed. The Company does not expect to know the result of the appeal until some time in the second half of 2003. For additional information respecting this matter, see "Critical
Accounting Policies


and Estimates—

Reserve for tax litigation and tax audits"

in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and
Results of Operations and Note 9 "Income Taxes" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements annexed to this report.

The
Company is named as a defendant in a number of other lawsuits, which are incidental to the ordinary conduct of its business. The Company does not believe that any such matters will
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operations.

During 2001 and 2002, through the downturn in the U.S. economy, the Company implemented its growth strategy by introducing new products, expanding international
coverage, and creating new sales and marketing programs. The Company's investments in product development resulted in a stream of product introductions throughout this period. The Company also placed
Zebra sales representatives in international territories deemed to have growth potential, thereby allowing the Company to work more closely with its channel partners in those regions. In addition, the
Company organized its sales and marketing efforts to support a sales strategy that demonstrates the business benefits associated with implementing bar code labeling and specialty printing solutions.
Management believes that these investments contributed to the Company's sales growth in 2002.

In
North America, the Company recorded positive sales growth in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2002, compared with the corresponding periods of 2001. Overall, however, the slow
U.S. economy continued to limit sales growth of bar code label and receipt printers to rates below the Company's historical average. Sales of supplies, specifically ribbons, were affected by price
pressure from increased international competition particularly from Japan. Sales of supplies nevertheless benefited from an increase in unit sales. Management believes that the long-term
outlook for bar code label and receipt printing in North America remains favorable but is unable to determine at this time when growth might return to historical levels experienced before the 2001
downturn.

All
three of the Company's international regions—Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America—had record sales and contributed to the significant growth in
international sales in 2002. The Company's increase of the number of Zebra representatives in these regions, including the formation of a sales team in Europe for mobile printing solutions in 2001,
was an important factor in the growth of international sales. On a dollar-volume basis, the largest increase occurred in the Company's European region. The strength of the British pound and the euro
versus the U.S. dollar increased sales for the Company's European region by approximately $5,565,000, compared with exchange rates that prevailed during 2001. It is difficult for management to
accurately forecast the direction of foreign exchange


movements, and therefore, to estimate the impact of foreign exchange rates on future financial results, either positive or negative. Management believes that international territories hold
significant growth opportunities for the Company and expects to continue to invest in personnel and infrastructure to support sales growth in these regions.

Gross
profit was $230,747,000 for 2002, up 9.9% from $209,893,000 for 2001. In addition, gross profit margin increased to 48.5% from 46.6%. The major contributors to the margin
improvement were higher capacity utilization related to the higher sales volume, product cost reductions, and the effect of foreign exchange movements. Management estimates that changes in foreign
exchange rates increased gross profit by $4,377,000 in 2002.

Selling
and marketing expenses increased 13.1% to $56,176,000, or 11.8% of net sales, from $49,688,000, or 11.0% of net sales. Most of the change can be attributed to an increase in
additional headcount and performance-related payroll expenses, specifically commissions and bonuses related to the Company's growth in net sales. Trade show, travel and consulting expenses were also
higher compared with 2001.

During
2002, the Company identified vertical markets that management believes offer growth opportunities for Zebra's printing and connectivity technologies. To this end, management
expects that a higher level of selling and marketing infrastructure will be required to access these markets and achieve the Company's growth objectives within them, compared with Zebra's historical
business model. Increased staffing occurred in marketing functions in 2002 to enable the Company to access vertical markets. Management expects that selling and marketing expenses in future periods
will reflect the higher costs related to generating business within vertical markets.

Research
and development expenses for 2002 were $29,210,000, up 3.6% from $28,184,000 for 2001, and represented 6.1% of net sales in 2002 versus 6.3% in 2001. Printer products introduced
over an 18-month period that ended December 31, 2002 accounted for approximately 22% of printer sales for 2002, compared with 20% for the comparable period ending
December 31, 2001. Higher project and personnel expenses were partially offset by lower expenditures for consulting services. The Company considers its ability to develop and introduce new
products to be a significant competitive factor. Accordingly, management expects to continue high levels of expenditures on the development of a broad range of printers and related items.

General
and administrative expenses increased 19.1% to $38,689,000 from $32,491,000. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 8.1% from 7.2%. The
Company had higher bonus payments related to the growth in net sales. It also incurred additional consulting expenses for the development and implementation of growth strategies, as well as higher
expenditures on information systems and insurance.

During
2002, Zebra recorded $1,494,000 in amortization of intangible assets, compared with $5,233,000 for 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, Zebra implemented SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

, which eliminates the requirements to amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill with a
requirement for an annual impairment test. SFAS No. 142 also establishes requirements for identifiable intangible assets. As a result, during the first quarter Zebra reclassified $21,272,000 of
intangible assets into goodwill, as such assets, which included assembled workforce and customer lists, did not meet the criteria for recognition as an asset apart from goodwill under SFAS
No. 142. Operating income for 2001 includes $3,835,000 of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not included in the 2002 results in conjunction with the implementation
of SFAS No. 142.

Also
in the first quarter of 2002, the Company terminated the acquisition agreement and tender offer in which the Company would acquire all outstanding shares of common stock (including
associated rights to purchase preferred stock) of Fargo Electronics, Inc. for $7.25 per share in cash. In


connection with the termination, the Company recorded $3,300,000 in expenses for acquisition costs that would otherwise have been capitalized. There was no such expense in 2001.

The
Company incurred merger costs of $73,000 in 2002 and $1,838,000 in 2001. These costs related to the acquisition of Comtec Information Systems in April 2000. Management expects
that future periods will have no further merger costs related to acquisitions completed prior to the date of this report. In the event of future acquisitions, management expects to record merger costs
related to those acquisitions, the amount of which cannot be determined at this time.

Investment
income was $10,004,000 for 2002, an increase of 84.6% from $5,419,000 for 2001. Favorable investment income was a result of a $1,953,000 pre-tax gain on the sale
of 585,000 shares of common stock of Fargo Electronics, in addition to the absence of a $2,242,000 pre-tax write-down of a long-term investment that occurred in
2001. The write-down occurred because the decline in the asset's value was viewed as other than temporary. This write-down reduced 2001 diluted earnings by $0.05 per share. The
Company made an additional write-down of $193,000 for this investment in 2002.

Income
before income taxes increased 15.3% to $110,883,000 from $96,139,000. As a percentage of net sales, income before income taxes increased to 23.3% from 21.4%.

The
effective income tax rate for 2002 was 35.4% versus 36.0% in 2001. This change is the result of implementing tax minimization strategies during the third quarter of 2002. Management
expects that these strategies will allow the Company to remain at a 35.0% effective tax rate in future periods.

Net
income of $71,595,000, or $2.29 per diluted share, for 2002 was up 16.4% from $61,529,000, or $1.99 per diluted share, for 2001.

The decline in sales was primarily related to softness in sales of bar code label and receipt printers in North America from deteriorating economic conditions in
the U. S., specifically in the manufacturing and technology sectors. A full year's sales of mobile printing systems as a result of the Comtec acquisition, compared with only three quarters in 2000,
partially offset the decline from this weakness.


The
decline in North American sales was a result of the slowdown in the U.S. economy, which restricted sales of bar code label and receipt printers in North America. This slowdown began
in 2000 and became more severe in 2001.

International
sales for 2001 showed virtually no growth. Growth in the Company's European region to a record level resulted from the formation of a team dedicated to the sale of mobile
printing systems and sales expansion in Eastern Europe. This growth was offset by sales declines in Latin America and
Asia Pacific. The strength of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound and the euro reduced sales for the Company's European region by approximately $2,976,000, compared with exchange rates that
prevailed during 2000.

Gross
profit was $209,893,000 for 2001, down 9.7% from $232,428,000 for 2000. In addition, gross profit margin declined to 46.6% from 48.3%. Lower production volumes and the resulting
decline in manufacturing capacity utilization had the predominant effect on the gross profit and gross profit margin declines.

Selling
and marketing expenses increased 2.9% to $49,688,000, or 11.0% of net sales, from $48,306,000, or 10.0% of net sales. During 2001, the Company continued to invest in
demand-generating activities to support long-term growth. For 2001, higher expenditures for personnel, market research and co-op activities were partially offset by declines in
travel and entertainment and other expenses.

Research
and development expenses for 2001 were $28,184,000, up 5.4% from $26,746,000 for 2000, and represented 6.3% of net sales in 2001 versus 5.6% in 2000. Lower project expenses
partially offset higher expenditures related to engineering personnel and consulting services.

General
and administrative expenses declined 3.3% to $32,491,000 from $33,594,000. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 7.2% from 7.0%. Higher
expenditures on information systems were partially offset by expense declines for personnel-related expenses from benefits and taxes, as well as lower expenditures on outside services for recruiting
and consulting.

Amortization
of intangible assets totaled $5,233,000, compared with $4,046,000 for 2000. The increase was due to a full year's amortization of intangible assets related to the Comtec
acquisition, compared with three quarters in 2000.

As
part of the Comtec acquisition, the Company acquired printer and wireless technology. A portion of the purchase price was attributed to acquired in-process technology, as
the development work associated with the projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and was believed to have no alternative future use. The Company assessed the fair value of the acquired
in-process technology using an income approach. During the second quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a $5,953,000 charge to write off this acquired in-process technology.
There was no such charge in 2001.

The
Company incurred merger costs of $1,838,000 in 2001 and $5,113,000 in 2000. These costs related to the merger with Eltron International, Inc. in October 1998, which was
accounted for as pooling-of-interests, and the Comtec acquisition. These costs exclude certain direct costs of the Comtec acquisition, which were not included as a portion of
the purchase price or recorded at the time of the transaction. In 2001, these costs primarily consisted of expenditures on information technology infrastructure to integrate the Comtec and Eltron
operations.

Investment
income was $5,419,000 for 2001, a decrease of 52.2% from $11,345,000 for 2000. Lower investment returns on invested balances contributed to the decline. In addition, in the
third quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a $2,242,000 pre-tax write-down of a long-term investment, in which the decline in value was viewed as other than
temporary. This write-down reduced 2001 diluted earnings by $0.05 per share.


Interest
expense and other expense, net, for 2001 totaled $1,739,000, compared with $8,104,000 in 2000. The 78.5% decline was primarily attributable to the effectiveness of currency
hedging strategies to minimize the effects of foreign currency transactions, which the Company implemented during the second half of 2000. In 2001, losses from foreign currency transactions on the
value of euro-denominated cash deposits and receivables from customers and pound sterling-denominated receivables from the Company's U.K. subsidiary totaled $896,000, compared with
$6,032,000 for 2000.

Income
before income taxes decreased 14.1% to $96,139,000 from $111,911,000. As a percentage of net sales, income before income taxes declined to 21.4% from 23.2%.

Net
income of $61,529,000, or $1.99 per diluted share, for 2001 was down 14.1% from $71,622,000, or $2.30 per diluted share, for 2000.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management prepared the consolidated financial statements of Zebra Technologies Corporation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements require certain estimates, judgments and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable, based upon the information available. These
estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the periods presented. The
following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Company's reported financial results.

Valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill.

Management assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise-level goodwill whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Factors considered important to possibly trigger an impairment review consist of:

•

significant
underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results

•

significant
changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business

•

significant
negative industry or economic trends

•

significant
decline in Zebra's stock price for a sustained period

•

significant
decline in market capitalization relative to net book value

When
it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise-level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the
existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, management measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be
commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model. Net intangible assets, long-lived assets, and goodwill amounted to $97,473,000 as of December 31, 2002.

In
2002, SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, became effective. As a result, the Company ceased amortizing
approximately $54,455,000 of goodwill, including existing intangible assets that were not considered identifiable under SFAS No. 142. The Company recorded approximately $3,835,000 of
amortization on these amounts during 2001 and would have recorded approximately $3,835,000 of amortization during 2002. In lieu of amortization, the Company was required to perform an initial
impairment review of its goodwill in 2002 and an annual impairment review thereafter.


The
Company completed its initial impairment review during the second quarter of 2002. Considering the share price of the Company's stock among other measures of fair value, this
impairment test indicated that the fair value of the Company's goodwill was significantly in excess of the carrying value. Consequently, no impairment charge was recorded.

Revenue Recognition

Zebra recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title. Certain customers have the right to return products that do not function
properly within a limited time after delivery. The Company regularly monitors and tracks product returns and records a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns, based on historical
experience and any notification received of pending returns. While such returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established, the Company cannot guarantee that it will
continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns. Any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse effect on
operating results for the periods in which such returns materialize. A 10% increase (decrease) in returns above historical levels would decrease (increase) operating income by approximately 0.3%.

Accounts Receivable

The Company has established standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts receivable. These policies and procedures
include credit reviews of all new customer accounts to establish credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information, which may include customer financial statements, bank and trade
references, credit rating agency information and other credit related information that becomes available. Additionally, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of current customers and adjusts
credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current credit worthiness, as determined by a review of current credit information. The Company has established regional credit functions,
reporting directly to the corporate financial officers, to manage the credit granting, review, and collections processes.

Over
the last three years, quarter-end accounts receivable balances have ranged from 53.0 to 68.5 days sales outstanding. As of December 31, 2002, accounts
receivable before provisions for uncollectible accounts were $72,535,000 or 53.0 days of sales. Similarly, past due accounts receivable are also at the low end of historical ranges as of
December 31, 2002. The historically low balance, high quality, accounts receivable portfolio is the result of improvements to credit and collections policies, procedures, and staffing
implemented during 2002.

The
Company maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues. Over the last three years, accounts receivable
reserves have been in the range of 1.7% to 2.9% of total accounts receivable. Accounts receivable reserves as of December 31, 2002 were $1,236,000, or 1.7% of the balance due. Management feels
this reserve level is appropriate given the relatively low accounts receivable balances combined with the quality of the portfolio as of December 31, 2002. While credit losses have historically
been within expectations and the provisions established, management cannot guarantee that the Company will continue to experience credit loss consistent with historical experience.

Zebra's
accounts receivable portfolio is diversified among a large number of customers and geographic markets. No individual customer exceeds 9% of gross accounts receivable balances as
of December 31, 2002, and only one customer exceeds 5% of gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2002. Included in accounts receivable is an account with a $2,100,000 disputed
balance. Although management believes this account is fully collectible, a $481,000 accrued liability has been recorded to cover the estimated cost of collection. If the actual collection, net of
costs, is less than $1,619,000, operating income would be reduced.


Inventories

The Company values its inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture, or the current estimated market value. Management regularly reviews
inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve
months. A significant increase in the demand for Zebra's products could result in a short-term increase in the cost of inventory purchases, while a significant decrease in demand could
result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, the Company's estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case the provision
required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated. In the future, if inventories are determined to be overvalued, the Company would be required to recognize such costs in
cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. Likewise, if inventories are determined to be undervalued, the Company may have over-reported cost of goods sold in prior periods and
would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale. The Company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand; however any
significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventories and reported operating results.

Over
the last three years, the Company's reserves for excess and obsolete inventory have ranged from 9.7% to 12.9% of gross inventory. As of December 31, 2002, reserves for excess
and obsolete inventory were $5,075,000, or 11.5% of gross inventory.

Reserve for tax litigation and tax audits

The Company has recorded the estimated liability related to certain pending tax litigation and tax audits based on management's estimates of the probable range of
loss. As additional information becomes available, management will assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and tax audits, and revise estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of
potential future liabilities could materially affect the results of operations and financial position.

The
Company is litigating a dispute over a 1998 tax assessment in the amount of approximately $2,000,000, including penalties and interest, with the Illinois Department of Revenue for
the years 1993 through 1995. The case was filed by the Company in the District Court of Illinois and tried during November 2000. The decision from the court was unfavorable to the Company but
has been appealed. The Company does not expect to know the result of the appeal until some time in the second half of 2003.

The
Illinois Department of Revenue has also examined the Company's tax returns for the years 1996 and 1997, and issued an assessment for $3,200,000. The issues involved in this audit are
identical to those involved in the 1993 to 1995 returns being litigated. The Company has paid this assessment under protest. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of this assessment will be
consistent with the 1993 to 1995 litigation under appeal.

In
addition, the Illinois Department of Revenue has not yet examined the Company's income tax returns for 1998 through 2001, but has a right to do so. Management believes that if such an
audit occurred, the Illinois Department of Revenue would raise issues similar to those raised during the 1993 through 1997 audits.

The
Company recorded tax reserves equal to management's estimate of the likely outcome of the Illinois Department of Revenue litigation for 1993 to 1995, the audit assessment for 1996
and 1997, and the unaudited 1998 through 2001 returns. If the Company loses all issues on appeal, the Company would record an additional one-time tax expense of $1,300,000. If the Company
wins all issues on appeal, the Company would record a reduction to tax expense of $4,400,000. For additional information


respecting this matter, see Note 9 "Income Taxes" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements annexed to this report.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Internally generated funds from operations are the primary source of liquidity for the Company, largely as a result of the Company's sales and profitability,
control over working capital and relatively low requirements for purchases of property and equipment. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $348,577,000 in cash and cash equivalents and
investments and marketable securities, compared with $249,349,000 at the end of 2001. Capital expenditures totaled $8,481,000 in 2002, $9,613,000 in 2001, and $8,947,000 in 2000. Management believes
that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements.

For
2002, net cash used in operating activities was $13,393,000, which included increases in investments and marketable securities of $108,498,000 and accounts receivable of $1,629,000,
offset by a decline in inventories and other assets totaling $6,891,000 and an increase in accrued liabilities of $2,564,000.
These changes are net of the effect of foreign exchange rates on cash. Depreciation and amortization totaled $12,259,000. Net cash used in investing activities was used exclusively for $8,481,000 in
purchases of property and equipment, and $13,032,000 in net cash provided by financing activities was substantially generated by proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Cash and cash equivalents
decreased by $7,910,000 for the year.

Net
cash provided by operating activities totaled $14,076,000 in 2001,which included an increase in investments and marketable securities of $78,874,000 and relatively significant
declines of $16,223,000, or 19.3%, in accounts receivable and of $17,284,000, or 30.4%, in inventories. Both declines exclude the effect of foreign exchange rates on cash. Depreciation and
amortization totaled $15,691,000. Net cash used in investing activities was used exclusively for $9,613,000 in purchases of property and equipment, and $8,863,000 in net cash provided by financing
activities was substantially generated by proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

Net
cash provided by operating activities totaled $132,565,000 in 2000. During the year, the Company reduced its investments and marketable securities by $60,860,000 as partial funding
for the Comtec acquisition. The Company also recorded increases of $7,106,000 in accounts receivable and $7,179,000 in inventories. Depreciation and amortization totaled $14,383,000. Investing
activities used $97,423,000 in cash in 2000. In addition to the $8,947,000 used for purchases of property and equipment, the Company used $88,476,000 for the Comtec acquisition, net of cash acquired.
For 2000, the Company used $48,675,000 for financing activities, including $55,505,000 for the purchase of treasury stock. Proceeds of $6,653,000 from the exercise of stock options had a positive
effect on net cash used in financing activities. For 2000, cash and cash equivalents declined by $15,041,000.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

.
SFAS 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and for the associated asset retirement costs.
SFAS 143 must be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will have a significant impact on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,

Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical Corrections.

SFAS 145 requires that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30. Applying the provisions of Opinion No. 30 will distinguish transactions that are part of an entity's recurring operations from those that are
unusual and infrequent and meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item. SFAS No. 145 is effective


beginning January 1, 2003. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 145 will have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.

This standard
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered
by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal
activity. This standard will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 146 will have
a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Risk Factors

Investors should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, as well as other disclosures in Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, because they could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, operating results, and growth prospects.

The Company could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes, including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption. Acquisitions could also dilute
stockholder value and adversely affect operating results. Proposed acquisitions that are not consummated may result in the write-off of certain acquisition costs.

The Company may acquire or make investments in other businesses, technologies, services or products. The process of integrating any acquired business, technology,
service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention,
which could otherwise be available for ongoing development of the business. The expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized. Moreover, the Company may be unable to identify, negotiate or
finance future acquisitions successfully. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization
expenses. To the extent that a proposed acquisition is not consummated, the Company may be required to write off certain costs associated with the acquisition, which could be significant.

The Company may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change.

To be successful, Zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new
products and services to address user demands.

Zebra's
industry is characterized by:

•

rapidly
changing technology

•

evolving
industry standards

•

frequent
new product and service introductions

•

evolving
distribution channels

•

changing
customer demands


Future
success will depend on the Company's ability to adapt in this rapidly evolving environment. The Company could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to
these changes, and may even be unable to adapt to these changes.

The Company competes in a highly competitive market, which is likely to become more competitive. Competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology
and changes in customer requirements.

Zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its systems. Principal competitors have substantial marketing, financial, development and personnel
resources. To remain competitive, the Company believes it must continue to provide:

•

technologically
advanced systems that satisfy the user demands;

•

superior
customer service;

•

high
levels of quality and reliability, and

•

dependable
and efficient distribution networks

Zebra
cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors. Increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions, lower
gross profit margins and loss of market share, and could require increased spending on research and development, sales and marketing and customer support. Some competitors may make strategic
acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products. Any of these factors could reduce the Company's earnings.

The inability to protect intellectual property could harm the Company's reputation, and its competitive position may be materially damaged.

Zebra's intellectual property is valuable and provides the Company with certain competitive advantages. Copyrights, patents, trade secrets and contracts are used
to protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of the Company's products or, without authorization, to obtain and use information
which Zebra regards as trade secrets.

Zebra sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components from foreign suppliers. These circumstances create a number of risks.

The Company sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the United States. Shipments to international customers are expected to continue to
account for a material portion of net sales. Risks associated with sales and purchases outside the United States include:

•

Fluctuating
foreign currency rates could restrict sales, or increase costs of purchasing, in foreign countries.

•

Foreign
governments may impose burdensome tariffs, quotas and taxes or other trade barriers.

•

Political
and economic instability may reduce demand for our products, or put our foreign assets at risk.

•

Restrictions
on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets.

•

Potentially
limited intellectual property protection in certain countries, such as China, may limit recourse against infringing products or cause the Company
to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories.

•

Staffing
and managing international operations may be unusually difficult.


•

The
Company may not be able to control international distributors working on its behalf.

Economic factors, which are outside the Company's control, could lead to deterioration in the quality of the Company's accounts receivables.

The Company sells its products to customers in the United States and several other countries around the world. Sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms,
which are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in a given country. A deterioration of economic or political conditions in a country could impair Zebra's ability to collect on
receivables in the affected country.

Infringement on the proprietary rights of others could put the company at a competitive disadvantage, and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly.

Third parties may claim that Zebra violated their intellectual property rights. To the extent of a violation of a third party's patent or other intellectual
property right, the Company may be prevented from operating its business as planned, and may be required to pay damages, to obtain a license, if available, or to use a non-infringing
method, if possible, to accomplish its objectives. Any of these claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel.

The Company depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel.

Future success of the Company is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel. The
loss of the service of any of executive officer or other key employees could adversely affect business. The Company neither has long-term employment agreements with key personnel, nor
maintains key man life insurance policies on any of its key employees.

The
ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to Zebra's long-term success. Competition for personnel in the Company's industry is
intense, and the Company may be unable to retain key employees or attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future.

Continued terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect the Company's stock price, operations, and profitability.

The terrorist attacks that occurred in the United States on September 11, 2001 caused periodic major instability in the U.S. and other financial markets.
Possible further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact. The United States continues to take military action against terrorism and has made strong overtures of
going to war with Iraq. Terrorist attacks and potential war in the Middle East may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the United States or
elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability. Any such attacks could, among other things, cause further instability in financial markets and could directly, or indirectly through
reduced demand, negatively affect the Company's facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers.

Taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves.

The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions in the United States and worldwide, and uses strategies to minimize its tax exposure. Local tax authorities may
challenge these tax positions from time to time. Adverse outcomes in these situations may exceed the Company's reserves for tax payments and may increase the Company's effective tax rate.


Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of its large investment portfolio. As stated in the Company's written investment policy,
the Company's investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk, which
includes the risk of interest rate movements. Risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle.

The
Company mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers, investment liquidity and broad diversification
across investment strategies, and which limits the types of investments that may be made. Moreover, the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an
ongoing basis.

The
following table sets forth the impact of a 1% movement in interest rates on the value of the Company's investment portfolio as of December 31, 2002.

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts business in approximately 100 countries throughout the world and, therefore, is exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates.
Currency exposures are related to the U.S. dollar/U.K. pound sterling, U.S. dollar/euro, and the U.K. pound sterling/euro exchange rates arising from invoicing European customers in pounds sterling
and euros from the Company's U.K. office. The U.S. dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate arises from invoicing customers in Japanese yen. The yen foreign currency exposure averages approximately $125,000.
There is no foreign exchange risk associated with the Company's investment portfolio.

The
Company manages its foreign exchange exposure through a policy of selective hedging. This policy involves selling forward up to 120 days projected remittances in euros from
the Company's U.K. subsidiary. Currency swaps that are net settled every month mitigate the U.S. dollar to U.K. pound sterling net exposure. This policy mitigates, but does not eliminate, the impact
of exchange movements on the value of future cash flows. Thus, adverse movements in either the pound or the euro in relation to the dollar can directly affect the Company's financial results. The
corporate treasury department executes all foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions only. Under no circumstances does the Company enter into any type of foreign exchange contract
for trading or speculative purposes.

The
following table sets forth the impact of a 1% movement in the dollar/pound and dollar/euro rates measured as if the Company did not engage in the selective hedging practices
described above. It is based on the dollar/euro and dollar/pound exchange rates and euro and pound denominated assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2002.

Equity Price Risk

From time to time, the Company has taken direct equity positions in companies. These investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business
opportunities. To the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company, the Company is exposed to the risks associated with such investments.

The
Company currently employs three investment managers, two of which manage portfolios of investment funds (i.e. fund of funds). These investment funds use a variety of investment
strategies, some of which involve the use of equity securities. Each investment manager's portfolio is designed to be market neutral, although an individual fund within a portfolio may be exposed to
market risk. By policy, management limits the amount of the Company's investments in alternative investment strategies to a maximum of 20% of the total investment portfolio, with no single investment
exceeding $10,000,000.

The
Company utilizes a "Value-at-Risk" (VaR) model to determine the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign
exchange and equity price sensitive instruments.

Independent Auditors' Report

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Zebra Technologies Corporation:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Zebra Technologies Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002. In connection with our
audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the consolidated financial statement schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts. These consolidated financial statements and
the consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the
consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Zebra Technologies Corporation and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1    Description of Business

Zebra Technologies Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Company) design, manufacture, sell and support a broad line of bar code label and receipt
printers and card printers, self-adhesive labeling materials, card supplies, thermal transfer ribbons and bar code label design software. These products are used principally in automatic
identification (auto ID), data collection and personal identification applications and are distributed world-wide through a network of resellers, distributors and end users representing a
wide cross-section of industrial, service and government organizations.

Note 2    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis to include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts, transactions, and unrealized profit have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash consists primarily of deposits with banks. In addition, the Company considers highly liquid
short-term investments with original maturities of less than seven days to be cash equivalents

Investments and Marketable Securities.

Investments and marketable securities at December 31, 2002, consisted of U.S.
government securities, state and municipal bonds, partnership interests and equity securities, which are held indirectly in diversified funds actively managed by investment professionals. The Company
classifies its debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories: trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Trading securities are
bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the ability and intent to
hold until maturity. All securities not included in trading or held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale.

Trading
and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost, adjusted
for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums. Unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related
tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity until realized.

Inventories.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, and cost is determined by the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization is computed primarily using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment, which are 30 years for buildings and range from 3 to 10 years for
other property. Property and equipment held under capital leases is amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.

F-8

Income Taxes.

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Intangible Assets.

Goodwill represents the unamortized excess of the cost of acquiring a business over the fair values of the
net assets received at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is no longer being amortized as required by SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

.

Other
intangible assets consist primarily of current technology. These assets are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 years. Accumulated
amortization for these other intangible assets was $3,865,000 and $5,944,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Revenue Recognition.

Revenue is recognized at the time of shipping and includes freight billed to customers.

Research and Development Costs.

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Advertising.

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000 totaled $3,965,000, $4,405,000 and $4,637,000, respectively.

Warranty.

The Company provides warranty coverage of up to one year on printers against defects in material and workmanship. A
provision for warranty expense is recorded at the time of shipment and adjusted quarterly based on historical warranty experience. The following is a summary of the Company's accrued warranty
obligation during the year ended December 31, 2002.

1,021

Add: warranty expense

Deduct: warranty payments

Financial instruments.

The reported amounts of the Company's financial instruments, which include investments and marketable
securities, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities,
income taxes payable and short-term notes payable, approximate their fair values because of the contractual maturities and short-term nature of these instruments.

Stock-based Compensation.

At December 31, 2002, the company has three stock-based compensation plans, which are
described more fully in Note 16. The Company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees,

and related Interpretations. No stock-based compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income

and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB No. 123,

Compensation,

Deferred Compensation Plan.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan that permits management and highly compensated
employees to defer portions of their compensation and to select a method of investing these funds. The salaries that have been deferred since the plan's inception have been accrued and the only
charges, other than additional deferred salaries, related to this plan are the unrealized gain/loss on the deferred amounts.

Foreign Currency Translation.

The consolidated balance sheets of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars using the year-end exchange rate, and statement of earnings items are translated using the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting translation gains or losses are
recorded in stockholders' equity as a cumulative translation adjustment, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Capitalized Software.

The Company's investment in software development consists primarily of enhancements to its existing
E-commerce web-based application, which will include the automation of current business activities. Specifically, the activities include the processing of customer orders; the
acknowledgement of customer orders and delivery; and the financial invoicing for all of Zebra's products and will aid in enabling the Company to create new business efficiencies.

Costs
associated with the planning and design phases of web-based development, including coding and testing activities necessary to establish technological feasibility of the
functionality of the website, are charged to research and development as incurred. Once technological feasibility has been determined, costs incurred in the construction phase of software development
including coding, testing, and product quality assurance are capitalized.

Funded Engineering Arrangement.

The Company was part of an arrangement with a third party, whereby the Company was reimbursed
for certain engineering services performed on behalf of the third party. The arrangement had a term of three years. The arrangement also provided that the Company would be the exclusive manufacturer
of the products resulting from the engineering agreement. The products would be distributed under the third party's brand name. During 2000 and 2001, the Company incurred approximately $2,800,000 of
reimbursable expenses under the agreement. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had an accounts receivable of approximately $2,100,000 related to this arrangement. A provision of $481,000 has
been established to cover estimated collection costs, which is included in accrued liabilities. The arrangement was terminated in 2002.

Acquisition Costs.

The Company periodically invests in potential acquisitions. Any external costs incurred are recorded as
prepaid expenses until such time as the Company either completes the

F-10

transaction or abandons the transaction. If the transaction is completed, the costs are treated as part of the cost of the acquisition. If the transaction is abandoned, the costs are expensed during
the period in which it is abandoned. During 2002, operating expenses include $3,300,000 of costs related to such an abandonment. As of December 31, 2002, the balance sheet includes $35,000 in
prepaid expenses related to acquisitions.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of.

The Company accounts for
long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

. The statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposition of the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations.

SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and for the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 must be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002.
Management is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will have on the consolidated financial statements.

In
April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,

Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical Corrections.

SFAS 145 requires that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30. Applying the provisions of Opinion No. 30 will distinguish transactions that are part of an entity's recurring operations from those that are
unusual and infrequent and meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item. SFAS No. 145 is effective beginning January 1, 2003. Management is currently evaluating the
impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 145 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.

This standard
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered
by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal
activity. This standard will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 146 will have
a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Note 3    Business Combinations

Comtec Information Systems, Inc.

On April 3, 2000, the Company acquired Comtec Information Systems, Inc.
(Comtec), by acquiring all of the outstanding capital stock of Comtec for approximately $88,476,000 in cash. Located in Warwick, Rhode Island, Comtec had been a privately held company. Comtec designs,
manufactures and supports mobile printing systems. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method. At the time of the acquisition, the purchase price was allocated to identifiable
tangible assets and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Estimated amounts allocated to acquired in-process technology were expensed at
the time of the acquisition. The consolidated statements of earnings reflect the results of operations of

F-11

Comtec since the effective date of the acquisition. At the time of acquisition, the purchase price allocation for Comtec was as follows:

Prior
to the implementation of SFAS No. 142, goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of 20 years and other intangible assets
were amortized over periods up to 15 years. These amortization periods are reflective of the expense amounts recorded in the Company's 2001 and 2000 income statements. Subsequent to the
implementation of SFAS No. 142, the amount allocated to current technology related to the Comtec acquisition is amortized over a period of five years and is included as a component of other
intangible assets on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. See Note 10 for a further discussion of the Company's implementation of SFAS No. 142.

Acquisition Termination Costs and Sale of Investment.

In the first quarter of 2002, the Company terminated the acquisition
agreement and tender offer in which the Company would acquire all outstanding shares of common stock (including associated rights to purchase preferred stock) of Fargo Electronics, Inc. for
$7.25 per share in cash. In connection with the termination, the Company recorded $3,300,000 in expenses for capitalized acquisition costs and other acquisition costs that would otherwise have been
capitalized. Also during the quarter ended March 30, 2002, the Company sold its investment in common stock of Fargo and realized a pre-tax gain of $1,953,000, which is included in
investment income.

Note 6    Related-Party Transactions

Unique Building Corporation (Unique), an entity controlled by certain officers and stockholders of the Company, leases a facility and equipment to the Company
under a lease described in Note 12. Management believes that the lease payments are substantially consistent with amounts that could have been negotiated with third parties on an arm's-length
basis and represent conditions at the time of the negotiations.

December 31, 2002 and $8,700,000 at December 31, 2001. Management expects such earnings to be permanently reinvested in these companies. Should such earnings be remitted to the Company,

Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts
as measured by tax laws. Based on management's assessment, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings.

The
Company is litigating a dispute over a 1998 tax assessment in the amount of approximately $2,000,000, including penalties and interest, with the Illinois Department of Revenue for
the years 1993 through 1995. The case was filed by the Company in the District Court of Illinois and tried during November 2000. The decision from the court was unfavorable to the Company but
has been appealed. The Company does not expect to know the result of the appeal until the some time in second half of 2003.

The
Illinois Department of Revenue has also examined the Company's tax returns for the years 1996 and 1997 and issued an assessment for $3,200,000. The issues involved in this audit are
identical to those involved in the 1993 through 1995 returns being litigated. The Company has paid this assessment under protest. The Company believes that the ultimate outcome of this assessment will
be consistent with the 1993 to 1995 litigation under appeal.

In
addition, the Illinois Department of Revenue has not yet examined the Company's income tax returns for 1998 through 2001, but has a right to do so. Management believes that if such an
audit occurred, the Illinois Department of Revenue would raise issues similar to those raised during the 1993 through 1997 audits.

The
Company recorded tax reserves equal to management's estimate of the likely outcome of the Illinois Department of Revenue litigation for 1993 to 1995, the audit assessment for 1996
and 1997, and the unaudited 1998 through 2001 returns. If the Company loses all issues on appeal, the Company would record an additional one-time tax expense of $1,300,000. If the Company
wins all issues on appeal, the Company would record a reduction to tax expense of $4,400,000.

Note 10    Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Data

During the first quarter of 2002, Zebra implemented SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

,
which replaces the requirements to amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill with a requirement for an annual impairment test. SFAS No. 142 also establishes requirements for
identifiable intangible assets. As a result, during the first quarter Zebra reclassified $21,720,000 of intangible assets into goodwill, as such assets, which included assembled workforce and customer
lists, did not meet the criteria for recognition as an asset apart from goodwill under SFAS No. 142.

Note 11 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plans

The
Company has a Retirement Savings and Investment Plan (the 401(k) Plan), which is intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Qualified employees may
participate in the Company's 401(k) Plan by contributing up to 15% of their gross earnings to the plan subject to certain Internal Revenue Service restrictions. The Company matches each participant's
contribution of up to 6% of gross eligible earnings at the rate of 50%. The Company may contribute additional amounts to the 401(k) Plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain
legal limits.

The
Company has a discretionary profit-sharing plan for qualified employees, to which it contributed 1.9% of eligible earnings for 2002, 1.9% for 2001 and 3.1% for 2000. Participants are
not permitted to make contributions under the profit-sharing plan.

Note 12    Commitments and Contingencies

Leases.

In September 1989, the Company entered into a lease agreement for its Vernon Hills facility and certain
machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures with Unique Building Corporation. The facility portion of the lease is the only remaining portion in existence as of December 31, 2002, and is
treated as an operating lease. An amendment to the lease dated July 1997 added 59,150 square feet and extended the term of the existing lease through June 30, 2014. The lease agreement
includes a modification to the base monthly rental, which goes into effect if the prescribed rent payment is less than the aggregate principal and interest payments required to be made by Unique under
an Industrial Revenue Bond (IRB).

F-19

Letter of credit.

In connection with the lease agreements described above, the Company has guaranteed Unique's full and
prompt payment under Unique's letter of credit agreement with a bank. The contingent liability of the Company under this guaranty as of December 31, 2002, is $700,000, which is the limit of the
Company's guaranty throughout the term of the IRB.

Derivative Instruments.

In the normal course of business, portions of the Company's operations are subject to fluctuations in
currency values. The Company addresses these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.

The
Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates to the funding of its United Kingdom operations. The Company
accounts for such contracts by recording any unrealized gains or losses in income each reporting period. The notional principal amounts of outstanding forward contracts were
€26,000,000 and £3,293,000 at December 31, 2002, and £16,391,000 and £6,019,000 at December 31, 2001. The realized losses, included in
other, net expense, were $1,432,000 in 2002 and $661,000 in 2001.

Legal proceedings.

On January 31, 2003, a Writ of Summons was filed in the Nantes Commercial Court, Nantes, France, by
Printherm, a French corporation, and several of its shareholders (collectively,
"Printherm"), against Zebra Technologies France, a French corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Printherm seeks damages in the amount €15,004,000 and additional
unspecified damages in connection with Zebra France's termination of negotiations in December 2000 with respect to the proposed acquisition by the Company of the capital stock of Printherm. The
Company believes that Printherm's claims are without merit, and the Company will vigorously defend the action.

Note 14    Stockholders' Equity

Holders
of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. Holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share. Holders of Class A and
Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class on all actions submitted to a vote of stockholders, except in certain circumstances. If at any time the number of outstanding shares of
Class B Common Stock represents less than 10% of the total number of outstanding shares of both classes of common stock, then at that time such outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock
will automatically convert into an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock.

F-20

Class A
Common Stock has no conversion rights. A holder of Class B Common Stock may convert the Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, in whole or in
part, at any time and from time to time. Shares of Class B Common Stock convert into shares of Class A Common stock on a share-for-share basis.

Holders
of Class A and Class B Common Stock are entitled to receive cash dividends equally on a per-share basis, if and when the Company's Board of Directors
declares such dividends. In the case of any stock dividend paid, holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to receive the same percentage dividend (payable in shares of Class A Common
Stock) as the holders of Class B Common Stock receive (payable in shares of Class B Common Stock).

Holders
of Class A and Class B Common Stock share with each other on a ratable basis as a single class in the net assets of the Company in the event of liquidation.

Note 15    Deferred Compensation Plan

Beginning January 1, 2002, the Company offered a deferred compensation plan that permits management and highly compensated employees to defer portions of
their compensation and to select a method of investing these funds. The salaries that have been deferred since the plan's inception have been accrued and the only expense, other than salaries, related
to this plan is the unrealized gain/loss on the deferred amounts. Investment income includes an unrealized loss of $16,000 for 2002 related to this plan. The Company has included $1,008,000 in other
long-term liabilities at December 31, 2002 to reflect its liability under this plan. To fund this plan, the Company purchases corporate-owned whole-life insurance
contracts on the related employees, of which the Company is the beneficiary. Investments and marketable securities include the cash surrender value of these policies aggregating $914,000 as of
December 31, 2002.

Note 16    Stock Option and Purchase Plans

As of December 31, 2002, the Company had three active stock option and stock purchase plans, described below.

The
Board of Directors adopted the 1997 Stock Option Plan, effective February 11, 1997, and 4,250,000 shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved for issuance under the
plan. The 1997 Stock Option Plan is a flexible plan that provides the committee that administers the Plan broad discretion to fashion the terms of the awards to provide eligible participants with
stock-based incentives, including: (i) nonqualified and incentive stock options for the purchase of the Company's Class A Common Stock and (ii) dividend equivalents. The persons
eligible to participate in the 1997 Stock Option Plan are directors, officers, and employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company who, in the opinion of the committee administering the
plan, are in a position to make contributions to the growth, management, protection and success of the Company or its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2002, 1,377,587 shares were available
under the plan.

The
options granted under the 1997 Stock Option Plan have an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. The options generally vest over
two- to five-year periods and have a legal life of ten years from the date of grant. The Board of Directors administers the plan.

The
Company's Board of Directors adopted the 1997 Director Plan, effective February 11, 1997. The 1997 Director Plan provides for the issuance of options to purchase up to 77,000
shares of Class A Common Stock, which shares are reserved and available for purchase upon the exercise of options granted under the 1997 Director Plan. Only directors who are not employees or
officers of the Company are eligible to participate in the 1997 Director Plan. Under the 1997 Director Plan, each non-employee director was granted, on the effective date of the plan, an
option to purchase 15,000

F-21

shares of Class A Common Stock, and each non-employee director subsequently elected to the Board will be granted an option to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock on the
date of his or her election. Options granted under the 1997 Director Plan provide for the purchase of Class A Common Stock at a price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. If
there are not sufficient shares remaining and available to all non-employee directors eligible for an automatic grant at the time at which an automatic grant would otherwise be made, then
each eligible non-employee director shall receive an option to purchase a pro rata number of shares. Unless otherwise provided in an option agreement, options granted under the 1997
Director Plan shall become exercisable in five equal increments beginning on the date of the grant and on each of the first four anniversaries thereof. All options expire on the earlier of
(a) ten years following the grant date or (b) the second anniversary of the termination of the non-employee director's directorship for any reason other than due to death or
disability (as defined in the 1997 Director Plan). A total of 52,500 shares were issued under this plan, which was terminated February 1, 2002. At December 31, 2002, 9,000 options issued
under the 1997 Director Plan remained outstanding and unexercised.

The
Board of Directors and stockholders adopted the 2001 Stock Purchase Plan and reserved 500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock for issuance thereunder. Under this plan,
employees who work a minimum of 20 hours per week may elect to withhold up to 10% of their cash compensation through regular payroll deductions to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock
from the Company over a period not to exceed 12 months at a purchase price per share equal to the lesser of: (1) 85% of the fair market value of the shares as of the date of the grant,
or (2) 85% of the fair market value of the shares as of the date of purchase. As of December 31, 2002, 68,905 shares have been purchased under the plan.

The
Company's Board of Directors adopted the 2002 Director Plan, effective February 1, 2002. The 2002 Director Plan provides for the issuance of options to purchase up to 160,000
shares of Class A Common Stock, which shares are reserved and available for purchase upon the exercise of options granted under the 2002 Director Plan. Only directors who are not employees or
officers of the Company are eligible to participate in the 2002 Director Plan. Under the 2002 Director Plan, each non-employee director was granted, on the effective date of the plan, an
option to purchase 20,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, and each non-employee director subsequently elected to the Board will be granted an option to purchase shares of
Class A Common Stock on the date of his or her election. Options granted under the 2002 Director Plan provide for the purchase of Class A Common Stock at a price equal to the fair market
value on the date of grant. If there are not sufficient shares remaining and available to all non-employee directors eligible for an automatic grant at the time at which an automatic grant
would otherwise be made, then each eligible non-employee director shall receive an option to purchase a pro rata number of shares. As of December 31, 2002, 100,000 shares were
available under the plan. Unless otherwise provided in an option agreement, options granted under the 2002 Director Plan shall become exercisable in five equal increments beginning on the date of the
grant and on each of the first four anniversaries thereof. All options expire on the earlier of (a) ten years following the grant date, (b) the first anniversary of the termination of
the non-employee director's directorship for any reason other than those listed in clause (c) below, or (c) the termination of the non-employee director's
directorship by the Company's stockholders for cause, or resignation for cause, in each case as defined in the option agreement.

For
purposes of calculating the compensation cost consistent with SFAS No. 123, the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for stock option grants in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively: expected dividend yield of 0% for each period; expected
volatility of 53%, 59%, and 58%; risk free interest rate of 4.55%, 4.38%, and 5.05%; and expected weighted-average life of six years, five years, and five years. The fair value of options granted was
$35,234,000 in 2002, $11,930,000 in 2001 and $24,290,000 in 2000.

F-22

The
fair value of the employees' purchase rights pursuant to the Stock Purchase Plan are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for purchase rights granted in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively: fair market value of $51.14, $38.18, and $44.62; option price of $43.47, $32.45, and $37.92; expected dividend yield
of 0% for each period; expected volatility of 40%, 54%, and 71%; risk-free interest rate of 1.32%, 2.17%, and 5.85%; and expected lives of three months to one year.
