Item 1.

Business

The Company

Zebra is a global leader respected for innovation and reliability which offers products and solutions that enable organizations to gain greater insight
into their operations. Improved visibility allows our customers to create value by managing their assets, transactions and people better.

Zebra’s extensive portfolio of marking and printing technologies, which including barcode, RFID, GPS and sensoring, captures physical events in
digital form to give operational events a virtual voice. This capture enables organizations to know in real-time the location, condition, timing and accuracy of events occurring throughout their value chain. Once the events are seen, organizations
can create new value from what is already there.

We design, manufacture and sell specialty printing devices that print variable information
on demand at the point of issuance. These devices are used worldwide by manufacturers, service and retail organizations and governments for automatic identification, data collection and personal identification in applications that improve
productivity, deliver better customer service and provide more effective security. Our product range consists of direct thermal and thermal transfer label and receipt printers, passive radio frequency identification (RFID) printer/encoders and dye
sublimation card printers. We also sell a comprehensive range of specialty supplies consisting of self-adhesive labels, thermal transfer ribbons, thermal printheads, batteries and other accessories, including software for label design, application
development and printer network management.

Zebra also designs and sells solutions incorporating active RFID, telematics and ultra wideband
radio (UWB) technologies. These solutions help businesses locate and or track assets and people in real time. They use battery-powered wireless tags, fixed-position antennae, transponder modules and application software. We also provide consulting
services, maintenance contracts and software licenses related to these solutions.



In July of 2012, Zebra acquired LaserBand LLC (a Missouri limited liability company). LaserBand is a leader
in patient identification wristbands and related products. LaserBand strengthens Zebra’s product and patent portfolio and enables Zebra to offer a wider array of products to hospitals, other healthcare organizations and other customers that use
wristbands in their operations.

In December of 2012, Zebra acquired StepOne Systems. StepOne is a mobility software company that empowers
store associates by giving them access to product details as well as store and company inventories to better serve their customers. StepOne’s retail application platform is incorporated into Zebra’s fully integrated mobile point-of-sale
(POS) offering, which retail customers use to create a more personal customer engagement and improve the overall shopping experience.

Discontinued Operations

Sale of
Navis, LLC

- On March 18, 2011, we sold our Navis marine terminal solutions business and the related WhereNet marine terminal solutions product line of our ZES business to Cargotec Corporation.

Sale of proveo AG

- On August 3, 2011, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with F Two NV (a Belgium company) and sold all of our
interest in Zebra Enterprise Solutions GmbH (formerly proveo AG) business.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, Zebra reported the results
of these businesses as discontinued operations. The amounts presented in Zebra’s financial statements for discontinued operations include Navis and proveo assets and liabilities, and the operating results of these businesses for 2012, 2011 and
2010. With the sale of Navis, we integrated the remaining ZES business into our location solutions operations.

Continuing Operations

Zebra’s continuing operations include our printers, supplies and services business and our location solutions operations.

Zebra’s printer operations

We
design our printer products to produce high-quality labels, wristbands, tickets, receipts, and plastic cards on demand. The exceptional diversity of applications using our printer products for barcoding and personal identification includes routing
and tracking, patient safety, transaction processing, and identification and authentication. These applications require high levels of data accuracy, where speed, reliability and durability are critical. They also include specialty printing for
receipts and tickets for improved customer service and productivity gains. Plastic cards are used for secure, reliable personal identification (state id cards and drivers licenses), access control and financial cards (credit, debit and ATM cards) by
financial institutions.

Applications for our printing solutions span most industries and geographies. They include inventory control, small
package delivery, baggage handling, automated warehousing, just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing, employee time and attendance records, file management systems, patient barcode wrist banding, medical specimen labeling, shop floor control, in-store
product labeling, employee ID cards, driver’s licenses, and access control systems. As of December 31, 2012, management estimates that Zebra has sold more than 11,900,000 printers to customers around the world.

We believe competitive forces on businesses worldwide drive them to strengthen security, reduce costs, more effectively manage assets, improve quality,
deliver better customer service, and increase productivity support the adoption of the printing and automatic identification applications Zebra provides. These solutions deliver significant and predictable economic benefits. Many of Zebra’s
applications enhance the use of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and other process improvement systems in manufacturing and service organizations. Greater emphasis on supply chain management, the drive to reduce errors in healthcare, and
heightened concern over safety and security are also increasing the use of automatic identification systems. Still other applications are taking advantage of recent advances in wireless and hand-held computing technologies.

Concern for safety and security and personal identification contribute to demand for our card printer products. This concern has heightened interest in
systems that provide personal identification and access control, including secure ID systems for driver’s licenses, employee and visitor badges, national identification cards, event passes, club membership cards and keyless entry systems.
Financial institutions utilize card printers for credit, debit and ATM cards.



Our printers are used to print barcode labels, receipts, plastic identification cards, wristbands, and tags
and to encode passive RFID “smart” labels and cards. We also sell related specialty labeling materials, thermal ink ribbons, and barcode label design and network management software. These products are used to support barcode labeling,
personal identification, and specialty printing solutions principally in the manufacturing supply chain, retail, healthcare and government sectors of the economy.

We work closely with distributors, value-added resellers, kiosk manufacturers and end users of our products to design and implement printing solutions that meet their technical demands. To achieve this
flexibility, we provide our customers with a broad selection of printer models, each of which can be configured for specific applications. Additionally, we will select and, if necessary, create appropriate labeling stock, ink ribbons and adhesives
to suit a particular application. In-house engineering personnel in software, mechanical, electronic and chemical engineering participate in the creation and development of printing solutions for particular applications.

We produce the industry’s broadest range of rugged, on-demand thermal transfer and direct thermal printers. Our printing systems include hundreds of
optional configurations that can be selected to meet particular customer needs. We believe this breadth of product offering is a unique and significant competitive strength.

Of the major printing technologies, which include ink jet, laser and impact dot matrix, we believe that direct thermal and thermal transfer technologies are best suited for most barcode labeling and other
on-demand printing applications. Thermal transfer printing produces durable dark, solid blacks and sharply defined lines that are important for printing readily scannable barcodes. These images can be printed on a wide variety of labeling materials,
which enable users to affix barcode labels to virtually any object. This capability is very important in the industrial and service sectors Zebra serves. Direct thermal printing is best suited where ease of use, smaller size and cost are important
factors in the application. Accordingly, this technology is found principally in Zebra’s mobile and desktop units.

As of
December 31, 2012, we offered 54 thermal printer models with numerous variations, in seven categories as follows:

•

Tabletop printers for applications requiring continuous operation in high output, mission-critical and industrial settings as well as demanding
commercial applications.

•

Desktop printers to deliver value and performance in applications with lower volume or space restrictions.

•

Mobile printers to meet the printing needs of mobile workers in a broad range of industries.

•

Print engines, which are sold to manufacturers and integrators of high-speed automatic label applicator systems and are available with or without RFID
smart label capabilities.

•

Kiosk and ticket printers for use in kiosks and other unattended printing applications.

•

Card printers, which print and encode national identity cards, driver’s licenses, employee identification badges, gift cards, personalized cards
and financial cards (credit, debit and ATM cards).

•

RFID printer/encoders for passive high frequency and ultra-high frequency radio frequency identification in the retail supply chain, for defense
logistics, and other applications. These units are used to print and encode “smart labels” in a single pass. Smart labels are printable labels embedded with an ultra-thin radio frequency transponder. Information encoded in these
transponders can then be read and modified by a radio frequency reader.

In addition to their use in on-demand automatic
identification applications, our thermal printers can also be used for on-site batch production of custom barcode labels and other graphics. This capability results in shorter lead times, reduced inventory, and more flexibility than can be provided
with traditional off-site printing.

Zebra’s location solutions

Zebra offers a range of solutions and services that enable businesses to have visibility into the location and movement of its personnel and assets with real-time locating systems.

Zebra’s location solutions incorporate active RFID technology. Our software and hardware locate, track, manage, and maximize the utilization of
high-value assets, equipment, and people. Whether tracking pallets through a supply chain, the flow of work in process, optimizing product fulfillment, or providing wide-area asset traceability, our real-time location solutions provide constant
visibility and accurate location.

Zebra provides asset tags, call tags, sensors, exciters and application software. Each tag contains a
unique ID that users can associate to a specific asset, part, workstation or person. The complementary technologies in our location solutions work seamlessly together to provide customers with asset visibility and tracking.



Applications for our location solutions span a broad array of industries where tracking assets, transactions
and people are critical. Our location solutions are deployed primarily in industrial manufacturing, process industries, aerospace, transportation and logistics and healthcare environments.

Printer supplies

Supplies products consist of stock and customized thermal labels,
wristbands, plastic cards, card laminates and thermal transfer ribbons. Zebra promotes the use of genuine Zebra brand supplies with its printing equipment.

We fully support our printers, resellers and end users with an extensive line of superior quality, high-performance supplies optimized to a particular user’s needs. Supplies are chosen in
consultation with the reseller and end user based on the specific application, printer and environment in which the labeling system must perform. These printing solutions frequently include proprietary ribbon and label formulations that are designed
to optimize image resolution and printer performance while meeting the most demanding end user application performance criteria. Factors such as adhesion, resistance to scratches, smudges and abrasion, and chemical and environmental exposures are
all taken into account when selecting the type of ribbon and labeling materials. The use of supplies that are not carefully matched to specific printers can degrade image quality, and decrease the life of key printer components such as printheads.

Zebra also provides a family of self-laminating wristbands for use in laser printers. These wristbands are marketed under the LaserBand name.

Printer related software

Our goal is to provide solutions that enable high levels of functionality to all major computer network and software systems. Zebra has specialized printer management, label design, printer drivers and
application development solutions to help unlock the full potential of Zebra printers. Our Link-OS™ suite of networking, software, device operating system offerings, makes Zebra’s printers easy to use and integrate into small, medium and
enterprise-wide environments. Zebra connectivity solutions include support for Ethernet, 802.11a/b/g/n, and
Bluetooth

www.zebra.com

, 24 hours per day, seven days per week.

Printer warranties

In general, Zebra
provides one year of warranty coverage on our printers against defects in material and workmanship. Our printheads are warranted for nine months, and our batteries are warranted for twelve months. Zebra supplies are warranted against defects in
material and workmanship for their stated shelf life or twelve months, whichever ends first. Defective equipment and supplies may be returned for repair or replacement during the applicable warranty periods.

Zebra’s technology

Our customers
rely on Zebra to provide products and systems to help identify, authenticate, track or route both items and people, and then process the related transactions. These products and systems use technologies that provide specific benefits in each
application.

All Zebra printers and print engines incorporate thermal printing technology, either direct thermal printing, thermal transfer
printing or dye-sublimation printing. This technology creates an image by heating certain pixels of an electrical printhead to selectively image a ribbon or heat-sensitive substrate.



Direct thermal printers apply the heat directly to a thermally-sensitive label, wristband, or receipt to
create an image. This form of thermal printing technology benefits applications requiring simple and reliable operations such as shelf labeling, patient identification, and kiosk receipts. Some desktop label printers, mobile printers and kiosk
printers support only direct thermal printing.

Thermal transfer printers apply heat to a ribbon to release ink onto labels or tags. This form
of thermal printing technology allows a wider range of specialty label materials and associated inks to be used for applications such as circuit board labels, chemical identification and product labels that require resistance to chemicals,
temperature extremes, abrasion, or labels requiring a long shelf life. Most of our printers in our high performance, midrange, print engine, desktop and mobile categories use thermal transfer printing but can also support direct thermal printing.

Dye-sublimation card printers apply heat to a ribbon to release a dye that is absorbed into a plastic card, retransfer film or treated paper.
This process creates full-color, photographic quality images that are well-suited for driver’s licenses, access and identification cards, transaction cards, on-demand photographs, and financial cards (credit, debit and ATM cards).

Direct thermal and thermal transfer printers create crisp images at high speeds, making them ideal for printing easily readable text and machine readable
barcodes. Dye sublimation thermal printers quickly create full-color images with visual characteristics more similar to halide-based film than to pixel-based ink jet or laser printers, making them ideal for high quality photographs and personalized
plastic cards. Some printers also include HF (13.56 MHz) or UHF (860-960 MHz) RFID technology that can encode data into passive RFID transponders embedded in a label, card, or wristband.

Zebra’s printers integrate company-designed mechanisms, electrical systems, and firmware. Enclosures of metal or high-impact
plastic ensure the durability of our printers. Special mechanisms optimize handling of labels, ribbons, and plastic cards. Fast, high-current electrical systems provide consistent image quality. Mobile printers use NiMH or LiIon batteries to
optimize print quality over an extended operating shift. Firmware supports serial, parallel, Ethernet, USB, infrared, Bluetooth, or 802.11a/b/g/n wireless communications with appropriate security protocols. Printing instructions can be received as a
proprietary language such as Zebra Programming Language II (ZPL II

®

), as a print driver-provided image, or as
user-defined XML. These features make our printers easy to integrate into virtually all common computer systems including those operating on UNIX, Linux, or Microsoft

®

Windows

®

operating systems.
Some independent software vendors, including Adobe, Oracle and SAP, have included Zebra printing support in applications for healthcare, warehouse management, manufacturing, passenger transportation, and retailing.

Printer sales and marketing

Sales.

We sell our printer products primarily through distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We also sell our printer products directly to a select number of named customer accounts. For media and
consumables, we sell directly to end users through the Internet and telesales operations. Distributors and VARs purchase, stock and sell a variety of automatic identification components from different manufacturers and customize systems for end-user
applications using their systems and application integration expertise. Because these sales channels provide specific software, configuration, installation, integration and support services required by end users within various market segments, these
relationships allow us to reach end users throughout the world in a wide variety of industries. We experience a minor amount of seasonality in sales, depending on the geographic region and industry served.

We functionally classify our direct VARs as Premier Partners, Advanced Partners, or Associate Partners, depending on their business competencies, depth
and breadth of their sales teams, customer support capabilities, contributions to Zebra’s strategic goals and sales commitment to Zebra. In addition, we offer VARs the opportunity to earn certifications for mobile/wireless printers, supplies,
services and RFID products in specific industries. We also sell through distributors, which in turn sell to an extended VAR community. All VARs, as well as OEMs and systems integrators, provide customers with a variety of automatic identification
components including scanners, accessories, applications software and systems integration expertise, and, in the case of some OEMs, resell the Zebra-manufactured products under their own brands as part of their own product offering. We believe that
the breadth of this indirect channel network, both in terms of variety and geographic scope, enhances our ability to compete and more effectively offer our solutions to a greater number of end users.

In some instances, we have designated a customer as a strategic account when the customer is in a targeted high-growth industry with applications for
Zebra solutions that span our product categories. Zebra sales personnel, either alone or together with our channel partners, manage these strategic accounts to ensure their needs are being met.

The sales function also encompasses a team that manages three global alliances. They direct the business development strategies for third-party
relationships that are strategic to new demand creation for specific vertical markets and/or specific applications.



Marketing.

Marketing operations encompass global corporate marketing, field marketing, product
marketing, industry marketing, market research and channel marketing functions. Corporate marketing manages our Zebra brand globally, corporate public relations, internal communications and our web site. Corporate marketing is also responsible for
market research and planning and industry marketing. Product marketing focuses on market analysis, positioning, product launch support and analyzes Zebra’s competitive strengths and weaknesses. Field marketing encompasses demand generation,
channel program management and marketing and sales enablement.

Printer production and manufacturing

We design our products to optimize product performance, quality, reliability, durability and versatility. These designs combine cost-efficient materials,
sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship.

In 2010 we completed the transfer of final printer assembly to a
third-party manufacturer, Jabil Circuit, Inc. This action reduces product costs and optimized our global printer product supply chain. It has enabled us to be more responsive to customer needs and increase Zebra’s flexibility to meet emerging
business opportunities.

Jabil produces our printers to our design specifications in the quantities we order. We maintain control over
portions of the supply chain including supplier selection and price negotiations of key component parts. Jabil is responsible for the procurement of the component parts and subassemblies used in the Zebra printers it produces. Zebra has a subsidiary
located in Guangzhou, China, and has an office located near the Jabil facility in China where our products are assembled. This office is staffed with our sourcing, engineering and quality personnel to help ensure that we receive optimal raw
material pricing, manufacturing process controls are maintained and the final printers meet our quality standards. The majority of our printers manufactured by Jabil are shipped to our regional distribution centers. A small percentage of products
are reconfigured at Zebra’s distribution centers through firmware downloads, packaging and customer specific customization before they are shipped to customers. In addition, certain products are manufactured in accordance with Federal
procurement regulations and various international trade agreements, and remain eligible for sale to the United States government.

Competition

Many companies are engaged
in the design, manufacture and marketing of barcode label printers, RFID printer/encoders, card personalization and active RFID/Real Time Locating System (RTLS) solutions.

We consider our direct competition in barcode label and receipt printing to be producers of on-demand thermal transfer and direct thermal label printing systems, printer/encoders, mobile printers and
supplies. We also compete with companies engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of printing systems that use alternative technologies, such as ink-jet and laser printing. Many of these companies are substantially larger than Zebra.

Dye sublimation, the technology used in our card printers, is only one of several commercially available processes used to personalize cards.
We also compete with companies that produce identification cards using alternative technologies, which include ink-jet, thermal transfer, embossing, film-based systems, encoders, laser engraving and large-scale dye sublimation printers. These card
personalization technologies offer viable alternatives to Zebra’s card printers and provide effective competition from a variety of companies, many of which are substantially larger than us. In addition, service bureaus compete for end user
business and provide an alternative to the purchase of our card printing equipment and supplies.

We compete with a diverse group of small
companies marketing RTLS solutions.

Our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors. These factors include the reliability,
quality and reputation of the manufacturer and its products; hardware and software innovations and specifications; breadth of product offerings; information systems connectivity; price; level of technical support; supplies and applications support
offered by the manufacturer; available distribution channels; and financial resources to support new product design and innovation. We believe that Zebra presently competes favorably with respect to these factors.

We face competition in our printing business from many printer companies, including the following (listed in alphabetical order): Argox; Avery Dennison;
Bixolon; Blue Bamboo; Boca Systems; Brother International; Canon; CIM; Citizen; Cognitive TPG; Custom; Danaher; Datacard; Datamax-O’Neil, a unit of Dover Corporation; Dymo, a Newell Rubbermaid Company; Epson; Evolis; Fargo Electronics, a unit
of HID Global; Godex; Hewlett-Packard; Hitachi; Intermec Inc.; Lexmark International; MagiCard; Matica; Microcom; Mitsubishi; NBS Technologies; Nisca; Oki Data; Olympus; Practical Automation; Printronix; Sato; Seiko Instruments; Song Woo
Electronics; Sony; Star Micronics; Taiwan Semiconductor; Toshiba TEC; Victor Data Systems; Woosim; and Xerox.



The supplies business is highly fragmented and competition is comprised of numerous competitors of various
sizes depending on the geographic area.

Zebra’s competitors in the location solutions products include Aeroscout, Ekahau and Ubisense.

Alternative printing technologies

We believe thermal printing will be the preferred label, card and receipt printer technology in Zebra’s target applications for the foreseeable future. Among the many advantages of direct thermal and
thermal transfer printing is the ability to print high-resolution, durable images on a wide variety of label materials at relatively low costs and high speeds compared with alternative printing technologies. We view passive RFID smart label encoding
and active RFID location systems as complementary technologies to barcoded printing, offering growth opportunities for Zebra as the technologies become more widely adopted.

If other technologies were to evolve or become available, it is possible that those technologies would be incorporated into our products. Alternatively, if such technologies were to evolve or become
available to our competitors, our products may become obsolete. This obsolescence would have a significant negative effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Therefore, we continually assess competitive and complementary methods of barcode printing and other means of automatic identification. Alternative print
technologies include ink jet, laser and direct marking. While we cannot be sure that new technology will not supplant thermal printing for labels, cards and receipts, we are not aware of any developing technology that offers the advantages of
thermal printing for our targeted applications. We continually monitor and evaluate new RFID technologies, support standards development and rapidly adopt RFID into new Zebra products and systems as new markets and applications emerge.

Customers

Zebra has sold more than
11,900,000 thermal printers to customers as of December 31, 2012. Zebra had three customers that accounted for 10% or more of its sales. All three of these customers are distributors and not end users. Our net sales to significant customers as
a percentage of total net sales were as follows:

No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total net sales during these years.

We believe that international sales are likely to increase faster than domestic sales because of the lower penetration of
automatic identification applications outside North America and Western Europe and generally higher economic growth rates in developing countries. As a result, Zebra has invested resources to support our international growth and currently operates
facilities and sales offices, or has representation, in 30 different countries.

Research and Development

Zebra’s research and development expenditures for the last three years were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):

We devote significant resources to developing new printing solutions for our target markets and ensuring that our
products maintain high levels of reliability and value to our customers.

Intellectual Property Rights

Zebra relies on a combination of trade secrets, patents, trademarks, copyrights and contractual rights to establish and protect its innovations. We hold
over 200 domestic and international trademarks. We hold over 700 United States and foreign patents and patent applications. The expiration of any individual patent would not have a significant negative impact on our business.

Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of our products or to
reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use some technology and information that we regard as proprietary. Moreover, the laws of some countries do not afford Zebra the same protection to proprietary rights, as do United States laws. There can be no
assurance that legal protections relied upon by Zebra to protect its proprietary position will be adequate. While Zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides certain competitive advantages, we do not believe that the legal
protections afforded to our intellectual property are fundamental to our success.

Other trademarks mentioned in this report are the property

Employees

As of January 26, 2013,
Zebra employed approximately 2,544 persons, of which 265 are corporate employees. None of our employees are members of a union. Some portions of our business, primarily in Europe and China, are subject to labor laws that differ significantly from
those in the United States. For example, in Europe, it is common for a works council to represent employees when discussing matters such as compensation, benefits or terminations of employment. We consider our employee relations to be very good.

Risk Factors

Investors should carefully
consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, as well as other disclosures in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, because they could have a material adverse effect on
Zebra’s business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and growth prospects.

Final assembly of our thermal printers and
our location solutions products is performed by Jabil Circuit, a third-party electronics manufacturer. We are dependent on Jabil as a sole source of supply for the manufacture of such products. A failure by Jabil to provide manufacturing services to
Zebra as Zebra requires, or any disruption in such manufacturing services, may adversely affect Zebra’s business results. Because we rely on a third-party provider such as Jabil to manufacture our products, Zebra may incur increased business
continuity risks.

Zebra is no longer able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of its thermal printers and location solution products. If Jabil experiences business difficulties or fails to meet Zebra’s
manufacturing needs, then Zebra may be unable to satisfy customer product demands, lose sales and be unable to maintain customer relationships. Longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories
during periods of unanticipated higher demand. Without Jabil’s continuing manufacture of Zebra’s products, Zebra will have no other means of final assembly of its thermal printers and location solution products until Zebra is able to
secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility. This transition could be costly and time consuming.

Although Zebra carries business interruption insurance to cover lost sales and profits in an amount it considers adequate, in the event of supply disruption, this insurance does not cover all possible
situations. In addition, the business interruption insurance would not compensate Zebra for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact, both short-term and long-term, on relations with our existing customers.

Zebra has significant operations outside the United States and sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important
components, including final products, from foreign suppliers. These circumstances create a number of risks.

Zebra has significant operations outside the United States which present added risks. In addition, Zebra sells a significant amount of
its products to customers outside the United States. Shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales. Zebra also expects to continue the use of third-party contract manufacturing services
with overseas production and assembly of our products.

Risks associated with operations, sales and purchases outside the United States
include:

•

Fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales, or increase costs of purchasing, in foreign countries,

•

Volatility in foreign credit markets may affect our customers and suppliers,

•

Adverse changes in, or uncertainty of, local business laws or practices, including the following:

•

Foreign governments may impose burdensome tariffs, quotas, taxes, trade barriers or capital flow restrictions,

•

Restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets,

•

Political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products, or put our foreign assets at risk,

•

Potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries may limit recourse against infringing products or cause Zebra to refrain from
selling in certain geographic territories,

•

Staffing and turnover at international operations may be unusually difficult,

•

A government controlled exchange rate and limitations on the convertibility of the Chinese

yuan,

•

Transportation delays that may affect production and distribution of Zebra’s products, and

•

Inadequately managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters.

Customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery.

Zebra monitors and tracks product returns and records a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification
received of pending returns. Zebra, however, cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns.

Zebra may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change.

To be successful, Zebra must adapt to rapidly changing
technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands.



Zebra’s industry is characterized by:

•

Evolving industry standards,

•

Frequent new product and service introductions,

•

Evolving distribution channels,

•

Increasing demand for customized product and software solutions, and

•

Changing customer demands.

Future success will depend on Zebra’s ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment. Zebra could incur substantial
costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes, and may even be unable to adapt to these changes.

Zebra competes in a
competitive industry, which may become more competitive. Competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements.

Zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its
products and solutions. Some competitors have substantial marketing, financial, development and personnel resources. To remain competitive, Zebra believes it must continue to effectively provide and economically:

•

Technologically advanced systems that satisfy user demands,

•

Superior customer service,

•

High levels of quality and reliability, and

•

Dependable and efficient distribution networks.

Zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors. Increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins
and loss of market share, and could require increased spending on research and development, sales and marketing and customer support. Some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies
that produce complementary products, which may create additional pressures on Zebra’s competitive position in the marketplace.

Zebra
is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of its business

. Zebra has grown rapidly over the last several years through domestic and international growth. This growth has caused increased
complexities in the business. We believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business and the demands from increased responsibility on our management personnel. The following
factors could present difficulties to us:

•

Compliance with evolving laws and regulations in multiple international jurisdictions,

•

Managing our distribution channel partners,

•

Managing our contract manufacturing and supply chain,

•

Manufacturing an increased number of products,

•

Increased administrative and operational burden,

•

Maintaining and improving information technology infrastructure to support growth,

•

Increased logistical problems common to complex, expansive operations, and

•

Managing increasing international operations.

Zebra could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes, including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption. Acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely
affect operating results.

Zebra may acquire or make investments in other businesses, technologies, services or products. An acquisition may present business issues which are new to Zebra. The process of integrating any acquired business,
technology, service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention, which could otherwise be available for
ongoing operations and development of the business. The expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized.

Acquisitions also may
involve a number of risks:

•

Difficulties and uncertainties in transitioning the customers or other business relationships from the acquired entities to Zebra,

•

The loss of key employees of acquired entities,

•

The ability of acquired entities to fulfill obligations to their customers,

•

The discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities,

•

The failure of acquired entities to meet or exceed expected returns, and

•

The acquired entities’ ability to improve internal controls and accounting systems to be compliant with requirements applicable to public
companies subject to SEC reporting.



Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of
debt and contingent liabilities.

Zebra sources some of its component parts from sole source suppliers.

A disruption in the supply of
such component parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively affect our financial results.

Infringement by Zebra or Zebra suppliers on the proprietary rights of others could put Zebra at a competitive disadvantage, and any related litigation
could be time consuming and costly.

Third parties may claim that Zebra or Zebra suppliers violated their intellectual property rights. To the extent of a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right, Zebra may be
prevented from operating its business as planned, and may be required to pay damages, to obtain a license, if available, or to use a non-infringing method, if possible, to accomplish its objectives. Any of these claims, with or without merit, could
result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel. If such claims are successful, they could result in costly judgments or settlements. Also, as new technologies emerge, such as RFID, the intellectual property rights of parties
in such technologies can be uncertain. As a result, products involving such technologies may have higher risk of claims of infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties.

The inability to protect intellectual property could harm Zebra’s reputation, and its competitive position may be materially damaged.

Zebra’s intellectual property is valuable and provides Zebra with certain competitive advantages. Copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, third
parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of Zebra’s intellectual property and its products or, without authorization, to misappropriate and use information which Zebra regards as its trade secrets.

Zebra may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects

. Zebra may be subject to
product liability claims, which could include claims for property or economic damage or personal injury, in the event our products present actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects. Such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in
Zebra’s own designed products but also in components provided by third party suppliers. Zebra generally has insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and also seeks to limit such risk through product design,
manufacturing quality control processes, product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers. However, due to the large and growing size of Zebra’s installed printer base, a design or manufacturing defect involving this large
installed printer base could result in product recalls or customer service costs that could have material adverse effects on Zebra’s financial results.

Zebra’s products are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. foreign regulations that pertain to electrical and electronic equipment, which may materially adversely affect Zebra’s business.

These
regulations influence the design, components or operation of such products. New regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and, in some jurisdictions, regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related
products into compliance with these regulations. Zebra’s failure to comply with these regulations may prevent Zebra from selling our products in a certain country. In addition, these regulations may increase our cost of supplying the products
by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components. In these cases, Zebra may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products, or we may incur unexpected costs or operational
complexities to bring products into compliance. This could have an adverse effect on Zebra’s revenues, gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results.

Zebra is implementing a new company-wide enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The implementation process is complex and involves a number of
risks that may adversely affect Zebra’s business and results of operations.

Zebra is currently replacing its multiple legacy business systems at its different sites with a new company-wide, integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP)
system to handle various business, operating and financial processes for Zebra and its subsidiaries. The new system will enhance a variety of important functions, such as order entry, invoicing, accounts receivable, accounts payable, financial
consolidation, logistics, and internal and external financial and management reporting matters. The system implementation has progressed well with EMEA implemented in January 2011 and North America in February 2012.

ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system hardware and software and implementation
activities that often continue for several years. Such an integrated, wide-scale implementation is extremely complex and requires transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the ERP system. Significant efforts
are required for requirements identification, functional design, process documentation, data conversion, user training and post implementation support. Problems in any of these areas could result in operational issues including delayed shipments or
production, missed sales, billing and accounting errors and other operational issues. System delays or malfunctioning could also disrupt Zebra’s ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of the results of its
consolidated operations, its financial position and cash flows, which could impact Zebra’s ability to timely complete important business processes such as the evaluation of its internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.



Until the new ERP system is fully implemented, Zebra expects to incur additional selling, general and
administrative expenses and capital expenditures to implement and test the system, and there can be no assurance that other issues relating to the ERP system will not occur or be identified. Zebra’s business and results of operations may be
adversely affected if it experiences operating problems and/or cost overruns during the ERP implementation process or if the ERP system and the associated process changes do not function as expected or give rise to the expected benefits.

Zebra depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel.

The future success of Zebra
is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel.

The ability to
attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to Zebra’s long-term success. Competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense, and Zebra may be unable to retain key employees or attract,
assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future.

Terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability
and adversely affect Zebra’s stock price, operations, and profitability.

The terrorist attacks that occurred in the United States on September 11, 2001, caused major instability in the U.S. and other financial markets. The possibility
of further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact. Any such attacks could, among other things, cause further instability in financial markets and could directly, or indirectly through reduced demand,
negatively affect Zebra’s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers.

Taxing authority challenges may lead to
tax payments exceeding current reserves.

Zebra is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. As a result, we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters. In addition, we may adjust previously
reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations. Such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to Zebra’s effective tax rate.

Economic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect Zebra’s business and results of operations

.

Adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending
may adversely impact our business.

As widely reported, financial markets throughout the world experienced extreme disruption since 2008, including historically high volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit
availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others, failure and potential failures of major financial institutions and unprecedented government support of financial institutions and corporations. A
recurrence of these developments and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect Zebra’s business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products by our customers. If a slowdown were severe enough, it
could require further impairment testing and write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets. Cost reduction actions may be necessary and lead to restructuring charges. A tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers,
suppliers, outsource manufacturer and channel partners (e.g., distributors and resellers) from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases. Another economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of
orders for Zebra’s products and services; negatively impact Zebra’s ability to collect its accounts receivable on a timely basis; result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable; and require additional reserves for
inventory obsolescence. Higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the U.S. dollar against currencies such as the euro, the British pound, the Chinese yuan, and the Brazilian real could negatively impact product sales,
margins and collections.

A natural disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect Zebra’s business and results of
operations.

As widely reported, a powerful earthquake centered off the northeastern coast of Japan on March 11, 2011, resulted in the loss of many lives, wide-spread damage to and destruction of property, disruption of electric power, and
the release of radiation from a crippled nuclear power plant. This devastation disrupted the operations to varying degrees of companies with business activity in the affected region, including the business of Zebra suppliers. Other natural disasters
may occur in the future and Zebra is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations. The consequences of an unfortunate natural disaster may have a material
adverse effect on Zebra’s business and results of operations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Results of Operations: Fourth Quarter of 2012 versus Fourth Quarter of 2011

Consolidated Results of Operations

(Amounts in thousands, except percentages)

Consolidated Results of Operations – Fourth quarter

Sales

Net sales for the fourth quarter
of 2012 compared with the 2011 quarter increased 2.4% primarily due to increased sales in supplies and aftermarket services. Printer unit volume increased 2.9% for 2012 compared to 2011 principally from unit volume increases in desktop and tabletop
printers.

Sales by product category were as follows (amounts in thousands, except percentages):



Sales declines in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific, primarily from a challenged business
environment, were offset by increased sales in North America and Latin America. Sales increased in Latin America in part from improved geographic coverage, with notable increases in supplies, tabletop, desktop, and mobile printers. Sales in North
America increased due to increased sales in supplies and aftermarket services. Zebra continues to build a broader base of customers to penetrate targeted industries more deeply. Movements in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by $1,858,000 in
the Europe, Middle East and Africa region for the quarter, due to a weaker euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the same period in the prior year.

Sales to customers by geographic region were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):

Gross profit

Gross profit increased 2.4% reflecting reduced overhead and freight costs, partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates and product mix. Unfavorable foreign currency movements
decreased fourth quarter gross profit by $1,806,000. As a percentage of sales, gross margin improved from 49.1% to 49.2%.

Printer unit
volumes and average selling price information is summarized below:

For the fourth quarter of 2012, unit volumes increased in tabletop and desktop printers. Desktop printers achieved record
sales. The decrease in average selling price is a result of a change in product mix toward lower priced products in the 2012 quarter compared to the 2011 quarter.

Operating expenses

Operating expenses are summarized below (in thousands, except
percentages):

Operating expenses for the quarter increased 1.2% due mainly to higher general and administrative expenses, amortization
and acquisition expenses, and exit and restructuring costs. Compensation costs and depreciation increased over 2011 levels. Amortization expense increases are primarily related to the intangibles acquired with the LaserBand acquisition. Acquisition
costs relate to investigated and completed merger and acquisition activity during the period. Exit and restructuring costs in 2012 relate to the restructuring of the location solutions business management structure.



Other income (expense)

Zebra’s non-operating income and expense items are summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Other expense decreased in the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of decreases in foreign exchange losses.

Operating income

Operating income for
the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, increased 4.7%. See comments above for explanation of changes in individual categories.

Income taxes

The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 21.0%
compared with 20.1% for the same quarter in the prior year. The fourth quarter 2012 effective tax rate increased slightly due to an increase in income in higher rate tax jurisdictions in 2012 when compared to the prior years quarter. The increase in
2012 was offset by an August 2012 decrease in the UK statutory tax rate from 25.5% to 24.5%. During 2012 Zebra implemented a new international holding company structure to facilitate the investment of overseas cash and international acquisitions.
This new structure has also decreased our international income taxes. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2012 benefitted from one-time adjustments resulting from amended tax returns for 2010 and prior years.

Income from discontinued operations

The
income in the fourth quarter of 2012 is related to a reversal of amounts previously reserved, which were related to the finalization of the accounting and taxes related to discontinued operations transactions during 2011.



Results of Operations: Year ended December 31, 2012 versus Year ended December 31, 2011

Consolidated Results of Operations

(Amounts in thousands, except percentages)

Consolidated Results of Operations – Full Year

Net sales for 2012 compared with 2011 increased 1.3%. This increase is primarily due to growth in sales of supplies, including the impact of the
acquisition of LaserBand LLC in July 2012. Printer unit volumes increased 6.0% for 2012 compared to 2011 due to volume increases in desktop, mobile and card printers. Movement towards lower-priced printers partially offset unit volume increases.

Sales by product category were as follows (amounts in thousands, except percentages):

Sales increased in Latin America due to improved geographic coverage with notable increases in supplies, mobile, and card
printer sales compared to 2011. Sales in North America increased due to increased sales of supplies and continued demand for desktop, card and tabletop printers. Zebra continues to build a broader base of customers to penetrate targeted industries
more deeply. Movements in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by $12,139,000 in the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions due principally to a weaker euro against the U.S. dollar.



Sales to customers by geographic region were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):

Gross profit

Gross profit increased 1.0% due to higher volumes and lower material costs. Lower freight costs in 2012 of $5,042,000 versus 2011 helped improve gross profit while unfavorable movements in foreign
currency decreased gross profit by $9,923,000. The above factors contributed to the slight decrease in gross margin from 49.5% to 49.4%.

Printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below:

Product unit volumes increased 6.0% in 2012 over the prior year. This was due to increased volumes in desktop, mobile and
card printers. The average selling price reflects a change in product mix toward lower priced products from year to year.

Operating
expenses

Operating expenses are summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):

Operating expenses for 2012 increased 7.4%. This is primarily due to greater selling and marketing and general and
administrative expenses. The asset impairment charge was accounted for 40.4% of the total increase in 2012. Several categories accounted for these increases, including compensation costs, outside professional services, rent, depreciation and
information systems expenses. Acquisition costs are related to investigated and completed acquisitions during the period. Exit and restructuring costs in 2012 relate to the restructuring of the location solutions business management structure while
costs in 2011 relate to the relocation and consolidation of administrative, accounting and distribution functions of our location solutions operations to Illinois. The asset impairment charge in 2012 relates to the goodwill associated with
Zebra’s smaller reporting unit.



Selling and marketing expenses

Selling and marketing expenses are summarized below (in thousands):

Selling and marketing expenses were higher in 2012 primarily due to increased payroll and benefit costs related to the
addition of more sales-related Zebra personnel in geographic regions with high-growth opportunities. Payroll and benefit cost increases include salaries, commissions, benefits, and payroll taxes. Other selling and marketing expense categories also
increased over 2011 levels due to higher expenses relating to the addition of Zebra sales representatives to expand Zebra’s global reach into new developing geographic regions.

Research and development costs

The development of new products and enhancement of existing
products are important to Zebra’s business and growth prospects. To maintain and build our product pipeline, we continue to make investments in research and development. In 2012 we introduced 14 new printer related products and 19 location
software and hardware releases. Zebra introduced its latest generation of print engine during the year which enables Zebra to expand into new markets. The ZE500 is designed for reliable operations in mission critical applications and is well suited
for use in the food and beverage industries and other environments where dust and moisture can create printing challenges. Zebra has enhanced its printers for cloud based connectivity through Zebra’s Link-OS, an ecosystem enabled by
Zebra’s printer architecture which makes Zebra printers significantly easier to integrate, manage and use in a company’s operations, with greater capabilities for customization with the development of specialized apps.

Quarterly product development expenses fluctuate depending on the status of ongoing projects. We are committed to a long-term strategy of significant
investment in product development. Research and development costs are summarized below (in thousands):

The decreases in research and development costs relate to decreased payroll and benefit costs and project expenses.
Project expenses decreased due primarily due to the completion on new mid-range and print engine products in 2012.

General and
administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses are summarized below (in thousands):



General and administrative expenses increased over 2011due to larger incentive costs related to merit
increases and equity incentives. Professional fees increased slightly due to the acquisition of LaserBand and other long-term investments in 2012. Professional services were also utilized for the implementation of Zebra’s new international
structure and to expand geographic regions. Information systems costs increased slightly in the maintenance and service contracts area.

Amortization of intangible assets

Amortization of intangible assets increased $1,353,000 during 2012 due to additions of current technology, patent and patent rights and customer
relationships during the year as a result of the acquisition of LaserBand.

Exit and restructuring costs

Exit and restructuring costs in 2012 of $960,000 relate to the restructuring of our location solutions business management structure. Costs in 2011 of
$2,041,000 relate to the consolidation of our location solutions operations following the divestiture of Navis in the first quarter of 2011.

Operating income

The operating income
decrease for 2012 was the result of operating expense increases as noted above.

Other income (expense)

Zebra’s non-operating income and expense items are summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Investment income increased overall from higher cash and investment balances in 2012 versus 2011.

Income taxes

The effective income tax
rate for 2012 was 25.8% compared with an income tax rate of 27.5% for 2011. During 2012 Zebra implemented a new international holding company structure to facilitate the investment of overseas cash and international acquisitions. This new structure
also decreased our international income taxes. In addition, the UK statutory rate decreased from 25.5% to 24.5% in August 2012. These reductions were offset by a discrete item in the third quarter of 2012 related to a non-deductible asset impairment
charge which increased the effective tax rate for 2012 by 1.9%. The rate in 2011 included a tax valuation allowance in the first quarter of 2011 against a subsequently divested subsidiary.

Income from discontinued operations

The income from discontinued operations in 2012 is
related to an amendment and extension of the proveo loan agreement and reversal of amounts previously reserved which were related to the finalization of the accounting and taxes. The income from discontinued operations in 2011 relates to the sale of
Navis LLC and proveo AG, offset by losses on discontinued operations.



Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010

Consolidated Results of Operations

(Amounts in thousands, except percentages)

Consolidated Results of Operations – year to date

Sales

Net sales for the 2011 year
compared with 2010 increased 10.0% due to a broad-based increase in demand, complemented by a focused business strategy of geographic expansion, new product introductions and expansion of go-to-market channels. New products introduced over the past
year helped us meet more of our customers’ needs for improving asset visibility in complex supply chain environments. The increase in sales was largely attributable to increased hardware sales with notable volume increases in high-performance
and mid-range tabletop, desktop, mobile printers and aftermarket parts. Supplies sales increased from greater shipments of labels and thermal ribbons. Printer unit volume increased 12.4% for 2011 compared to levels in 2010.

Sales by product category were as follows (amounts in thousands, except percentages):



Sales increased in all geographic regions, in part from the impact of our investments in sales and
sales-related personnel to expand Zebra’s presence in high-growth regions including China, Brazil and Eastern Europe. Sales in the regions targeted by Zebra for geographic expansion increased by 22%. Movements in foreign exchange rates
increased sales by $14,412,000 in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region due principally to a stronger euro against the U.S. dollar for the first three quarters of 2011.

Sales to customers by geographic region were as follows (in thousands, except percentages):

Gross profit

Gross profit increased 15.7% due to higher volumes and lower material costs. Lower freight costs in 2011 of $4,963,000 versus 2010 helped improve profit. Gross profit was also affected by favorable
foreign currency movements which also improved gross profit by $12,730,000. The above factors contributed to the increase in gross margin from 47.0% to 49.5%.

Printer unit volumes and average selling price information is summarized below:

For 2011, product unit volumes increased in nearly all printer product lines with notable volume increases in
high-performance and mid-range table top, desktop, and mobile.

Operating expenses

Operating expenses are summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):

Operating expenses for 2011 increased 11.8% due to higher expenses in all three operating expense line items. Several
categories accounted for these increases, including compensation costs which include salaries, stock option expense, and commissions. These increases are primarily related to more employees in 2011 versus 2010. Business development, outside
professional services, travel and entertainment, rent, information systems, recruiting, offsite meetings, shipping and depreciation expenses all increased over 2010 levels.



Selling and marketing expenses

Selling and marketing expenses are summarized below (in thousands):

Selling and marketing expenses were higher in 2011 primarily due to increased payroll and benefit costs related to the
addition of more sales-related Zebra personnel in geographic regions with high-growth opportunities and increased sales volume. Payroll and benefit cost increases include salaries, bonus, commissions, benefits and payroll taxes. Other selling and
marketing expense categories also increased over 2010 levels due to higher expenses relating to the addition of Zebra sales representatives to expand Zebra’s global reach into new developing geographic regions and a global partner conference in
2011.

Research and development costs

The development of new products and enhancement of existing products are important to Zebra’s business and growth prospects. To maintain and build our product pipeline, we continue to make
investments in research and development. In 2011 we introduced 13 new printer related products and 10 location software and hardware releases. Products introduced in 2011 include printers in the mobile, desktop, and card lines as well as related
accessories. Zebra is receiving positive customer responses to its recently introduced QLn wireless mobile printer which incorporates a flexible user interface for easy configuration. Zebra’s ZXP8 retransfer card printer which is utilized for
printing secure employee IDs. In 2010, we introduced an updated two inch light duty printer and a new Xi4 high-performance printer. We also introduced innovative new IQ color labels which enables customers to print spot colors on predetermined areas
of a label using any Zebra thermal label printer. This breakthrough product enhances readability, increases business efficiency and improves safety.

Quarterly product development expenses fluctuate depending on the status of ongoing projects. We are committed to a long-term strategy of significant investment in product development. Research and
development costs are summarized below (in thousands):

The increases in research and development costs relate to increased payroll and benefit costs, compliance and project
expenses to bring new products to market.



General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses are summarized below (in thousands):

General and administrative expenses increased over 2010 amounts from larger incentive costs related to merit increases
and equity incentives. Professional fees increased slightly due to the Navis and proveo dispositions in 2011, and the utilization of professional services in the expanding geographic regions. Information systems costs increased slightly primarily in
the maintenance and service contracts area.

Amortization of intangible assets

Amortization of intangible assets increased $109,000 during 2011 due to additions of patents during the year.

Litigation settlement

In 2010 Zebra received litigation settlement proceeds of $1,082,000
related to our acquisition of MSSI in 2008.

Exit and restructuring costs

Exit and restructuring costs in 2011 of $2,041,000 relate to the consolidation of our Location solutions product line following the divestiture of Navis in the first quarter of 2011. Costs in 2010 of
$2,262,000 relate to the completion of the production transfer to Jabil. See Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of exit and restructuring charges.

Operating income

The operating income
increase for 2011 was the result of increased sales and gross profit as noted above.

Other income (expense)

Zebra’s non-operating income and expense items are summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Investment income declined overall from lower short-term interest rates in 2011 compared with 2010 even though cash and
investment balances were higher in 2011 versus 2010.



Income taxes

The effective income tax rate for 2011 was 27.5% compared with an income tax rate of 30.1% for 2010. Zebra’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 included a $2,764,000 reduction of
federal taxes related to improperly accounting for the tax impact on intercompany profit generated from intercompany sales in 2009. This adjustment reduced our effective rate for 2010 by approximately 1.8%. Zebra’s effective rate has also
decreased in 2011 due to higher profits in lower rate international jurisdictions.

Income (loss) discontinued operations

The income from discontinued operations in 2011 relates to the sale of Navis LLC and proveo AG, offset by losses on discontinued operations. The loss from
discontinued operations for 2010 represents the results of operations for the entities we divested in 2011.

Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates

Management prepared the consolidated financial statements of Zebra under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These principles require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable, based upon the information available.

Our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements. The following accounting policies comprise those that we believe
are the most critical in understanding and evaluating Zebra’s reported financial results.

Revenue Recognition

Product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met: (1) we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits; (2) delivery has occurred
and title has passed to the customer, which happens at the point of shipment (except in Asia where the terms are FOB destination) provided that no significant obligations remain; (3) the price is fixed and determinable; and
(4) collectability is reasonably assured. Other items that affect our revenue recognition include:

Customer
returns

Customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery. We
monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns. Returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions
established, but Zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns. Historically, our product returns have not been significant. However, if a significant issue should arise, it could have a
material impact on our financial statements.

Growth Rebates

Some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products
they purchase from us over a quarter or year. These rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Each quarter, we estimate the amount of outstanding rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history. Historically, actual rebates
have been in line with our estimates.

Price Protection

Some of our customers are offered price protection by Zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product. These price protection
plans provide that if we lower prices, we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold. We estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve, which is charged against revenue. Our customers
typically carry limited amounts of inventory, and Zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products. As a result, the amounts paid under these plans have been minimal.

Software Revenue

We sell four types of software and record revenue as
follows:

•

Our printers contain

embedded firmware,

which is part of the hardware purchase. We consider the sale of this firmware to be incidental to the
sale of the printer and do not attribute any revenue to it.

•

We sell a limited amount of

prepackaged,

or

off-the-shelf, software

for the creation of barcode labels using our printers. There is no
customization required to use this software, and we have no post-shipment obligations on the software. Revenue is recognized at the time this prepackaged software is shipped.

•

We sometimes provide

custom software

as part of a printer installation project. We bill custom software development services separate from the
related hardware. Revenue related to custom software is recognized once the custom software development services have been completed and accepted by the customer.

•

We recognize license revenue under ASC (Accounting Standards Codification) 985, when (1) a signed contract is obtained; (2) delivery of the
product has occurred; (3) the license fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is probable.



Maintenance and Support Agreements

We enter into post-contract maintenance and support agreements. Revenues are recognized ratably over the service period and the cost of
providing these services is expensed as incurred.

Shipping and Handling

We charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items. The amounts billed to
customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships. Any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales.

Zebra
enters into sales transactions that include more than one product type. This bundle of products might include printers, current or future supplies, and services. When this type of transaction occurs, we allocate the purchase price to each product
type based on the fair value of the individual products determined by vendor specific objective evidence. The revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the recognition criteria for that product is fully met.

Investments and Marketable Securities

Investments and marketable securities at December 31, 2012, consisted of the following:

U.S. government and agency securities

Includes investments in notes issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Bank.

Trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Held-to-maturity
securities are those debt securities that Zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. Securities not included in trading or held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale.

Trading and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost, adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums.
Unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate
component of stockholders’ equity until realized.

Zebra’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as
available-for-sale except for securities held in Zebra’s deferred compensation plan which are considered to be trading securities. Investments in marketable debt securities are classified based on intent and ability to sell investment
securities. Zebra’s available-for-sale securities are used to fund further acquisitions and other operating needs and therefore can be sold prior to maturity. Investments in marketable debt securities for which Zebra intends to sell within
the next year are classified as current and those that we intend to hold in excess of one-year are classified as non-current.

Accounts
Receivable

We have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts, including:

•

Credit reviews of all new customer accounts,

•

Ongoing credit evaluations of current customers,

•

Credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information,

•

Adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current credit worthiness,

•

Active collection efforts by regional credit functions, reporting directly to the corporate financial officers, and

•

Limited credit insurance on the majority of our international revenues.

We reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues. Over the last three years, accounts receivable reserves varied from 0.4% to 1.2% of total
accounts receivable. Accounts receivable reserves as of December 31, 2012, were $669,000, or 0.4% of the balance due. We believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of December 31, 2012. While
credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience.



Inventories

We value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or the current estimated market value. We review inventory quantities on
hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months.

Over the last three years, our inventory reserves have ranged from 8.0% to 11.9% of gross inventory. As of December 31, 2012, inventory reserves were $13,655,000, or 10.0% of gross inventory. We
believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of December 31, 2012.

Valuation of Goodwill

Goodwill of a
reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances include:

•

Significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate,

•

Adverse action or assessment by a regulator,

•

Unanticipated competition,

•

Loss of key personnel,

•

More-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of,

•

Testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, or

•

Allocation of a portion of goodwill to a business to be disposed of.

If we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform an impairment test. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment
test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using three valuation methods: Income Approach –
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, Market Approach – Guideline Public Company Method, and Market Approach – Comparative Transactions Method. The approach defined below is based upon our last impairment test conducted in June 2012 as of the end
of May 2012. Zebra did perform an interim impairment test in October 2012 for its smaller reporting unit as of the end of September 2012. The October 2012 test only utilized the income approach as discussed below.

Under the “Income Approach – Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” the key assumptions consider sales, cost of sales and operating expenses
projected through the year 2021. These assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan and assuming growth rates for revenues and operating expenses, and margin assumptions. The fourth key assumption under this
approach is the discount rate which is determined by looking at current risk-free rates of capital, current market interest rates and the evaluation of risk premium relevant to the business segment. If our assumptions relative to growth rates were
to change or were incorrect, our fair value calculation may change which could result in impairment. The company’s risk factors are discussed under Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Under the “Market Approach – Guideline Company Method” we identified 20 publicly traded companies, including Zebra, which we believe have significant relevant similarities. For these 20
companies we calculated the mean ratio of invested capital to revenues and invested capital to EBITDA. Similar to the Income approach discussed above, sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and their respective growth rates were the key
assumptions utilized. The market prices of Zebra and other guideline company shares are key assumptions. If these market prices increase, the estimated market value would increase. If the market prices decrease, the estimated market value would
decrease.

Under the “Market Approach – Comparative Transactions Method” we looked at 19 market based transactions for
companies that have similarities to our business segment, including similarities to one or more of the business lines, markets, growth prospects, margins and size. We calculated mean revenue and EBITDA multiples for the selected transactions. These
multiples were applied to forecasted Zebra results for that segment to estimate market value. The key assumptions and impact to changes to those assumptions would be similar to those assumptions under the “Income Approach – Discounted Cash
Flow Analysis” and the “Market Approach – Guideline Company Method”.

The results of these three methods are weighted
based upon managements’ determination with more weight attached to the Income approach because it considers anticipated future financial performance. The Market approaches are based upon historical and current economic conditions which might
not reflect the long term prospects or opportunities for our business segment being evaluated.



If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the
second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value
of that goodwill.

There have not been any significant changes to our impairment testing methodology other than updating the assumptions to
reflect the current market environment. As discussed above, key assumptions used in the first step of the goodwill impairment test were determined by management utilizing the internal operating plan. The key assumptions utilized include forecasted
growth rates for revenues and operating expenses as well as a discount rate which is determined by looking at current risk-free rates of capital, current market interest rates and the evaluation of a risk premium relevant to the business segment.
Zebra will monitor future results and will perform a test if indicators trigger an impairment review.

We test the impairment of goodwill each
year as of the end of May or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Zebra has two reporting units required for its annual goodwill impairment test. We completed our annual assessment
during June 2012 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of the end of May 2012.As part of Zebra’s annual impairment test in the second quarter, Management determined that the larger of the two reporting units’ fair value
exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount. The second smaller reporting unit’s amount by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value ranged from approximately 8% under the Income Approach to 31% under the Market Approach.

Due to the deterioration in the smaller reporting unit’s operating results during the third quarter, failing to meet our forecasted
revenues and operating expenses, and a decline in expected growth rates, our fair value calculation for the smaller reporting unit changed and we determined our goodwill associated with the smaller reporting unit was impaired. The above impairment
indicators led us to conclude an interim goodwill test was necessary. Zebra performed the first step of the impairment test which failed. As a result, Zebra also performed a second step analysis and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of
$9,114,000 as of September 29, 2012. After this impairment charge, there is no remaining goodwill in the smaller reporting unit.

Valuation of Long-Lived and Other Intangible Assets

Zebra evaluates the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors
considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of:

•

Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results,

•

Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business,

•

Significant negative industry or economic trends,

•

Significant decline in Zebra’s stock price for a sustained period, and

•

Significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value.

If Zebra believes that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred and the undiscounted cash flow test has failed in the case of amortizable assets, Zebra measures impairment based on
projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows.

Net intangible assets,
long-lived assets and goodwill amounted to $235,442,000 as of December 31, 2012.

Income Taxes

On January 1, 2007, we adopted ASC 740. According to ASC 740, Zebra identified, evaluated, and measured the amount of income tax benefits to be
recognized for all of our income tax positions. During 2008, Zebra recognized an increase of approximately $4,000,000 in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to an acquisition. During 2012 Zebra recognized an increase of $680,000 for
tax benefits related to the foreign restructuring.



A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in
thousands):

Zebra’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income
tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, we did not accrue any interest or penalties into income tax expense.

An audit of U.S. federal income tax returns for years of 2008 through 2010 was completed in 2012. The tax years 2008 through 2010 remain open to examination by multiple state taxing jurisdictions. Tax
authorities in the United Kingdom have completed income tax audits for tax years through 2008.

Included in deferred tax assets are amounts
related to federal and state net operating losses that resulted from Zebra’s acquisition of WhereNet Corp. As of December 31, 2012, Zebra had approximately $2,518,000 of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future
taxable income which expire in 2022 through 2027. As of December 31, 2012, Zebra also had approximately $27,391,000 of state net operating loss carryforwards which expire in 2012 through 2020. Zebra’s intention is to utilize these net
operating loss carryforwards to offset future income tax expense. Under the United States Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amount of benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances, including significant
changes in ownership interests.

During 2012, Zebra established a foreign holding company structure that is designed to accomplish various international
business objectives. This new holding company structure allows Zebra to consolidate the ownership of its significant foreign affiliates under a single holding company. In addition, the structure gives the company the ability to facilitate cash
pooling for its non-US operations and provide for the tax efficient movement of cash within the structure to efficiently deploy cash generated by the foreign subsidiaries. Zebra’s international income taxes have also decreased as result of this
project.

Contingencies

Zebra records estimated liabilities related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes. Quarterly, Zebra assesses the potential
liability related to pending litigation, tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate.

For
further information regarding material pending legal proceedings, see Note 12 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Form 10-K.

Equity-Based Compensation

As of December 31, 2012, Zebra had an active equity-based
compensation plan and a stock purchase plan available for future grants. We accounted for these plans in accordance with ASC 505 and ASC 718. Zebra recognizes compensation costs using the straight-line method over the vesting period of up to 5
years. See Notes 2 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Form 10-K for further information.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

(Amounts in thousands, except percentages):

Average cash and marketable securities balances for 2012 increased compared to 2011 as a result of increased cash
provided by operations.

As of December 31, 2012, Zebra had $394,075,000 in cash, restricted cash, investments and marketable securities,
compared with $326,695,000 at December 31, 2011. Factors affecting cash and investment balances during 2012 include the following (changes below include the impact of foreign currency):

•

Accounts receivable increased $8,647,000 due to the increased sales and the timing of receipts.

•

Inventories decreased $11,530,000 due to decreases in raw materials inventory.

•

Accounts payable decreased $14,605,000 due to the timing of payments at period end.

•

Income taxes increased $16,335,000 due to the timing of tax payments and taxes incurred.

•

Purchases of property and equipment totaled $22,443,000.

•

Escrowed proceeds received from the sale of Navis totaled $27,580,000.

•

Acquisition of businesses totaled $59,876,000.

•

Purchases of treasury stock totaled $54,373,000.

Management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements.

Zebra earns a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. Zebra
does not currently foresee a need to repatriate funds, however, should Zebra require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations locally, Zebra could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the
U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense. Included in Zebra’s cash, restricted cash, investments and marketable securities are amounts held by foreign
subsidiaries. Zebra had $173,483,000 as of December 31, 2012, and $96,829,000 as of December 31, 2011 of foreign cash and investments, which are generally invested in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings.

Contractual Obligations

Zebra’s
contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 were (in thousands):

Purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements, primarily
raw materials and finished goods.

On October 10, 2012, Zebra entered into a revolving credit agreement for a five-year $250 million
revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by J. P. Morgan Securities LLC as Administrative Agent. The funds under this credit facility are available for general corporate purposes of Zebra and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of
business and other



purposes permitted by the agreement. As of December 31, 2012, we had established letters of credit amounting to $2,300,000, which reduce the funds available for borrowing under the
agreement. No amounts were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2012.

Management believes that existing capital
resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements.

Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements

In June 2011, the FASB issued update 2011-05, ASC 220,

Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income

and in December 2011, the FASB issued update 2011-12, ASC 220,

Comprehensive Income: Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting
Standards Update No. 2011-05.

ASU No. 2011-12 is to defer only those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. Entities should continue to report reclassifications out of
accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before ASU No. 2011-05. All other requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 are not affected by ASU No. 2011-12, including the requirement to report
comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. This standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this
standard moved the Other Comprehensive Income statement disclosure from our footnote to its own financial statement for our 10-Q filings in 2012.

In September 2011, the FASB issued update 2011-08, ASC 350,

Intangibles Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment

. This updated guidance simplifies how companies test goodwill for
impairment. Essentially, companies are no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount using a qualitative
assessment. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have any effect upon our consolidated financial statements.

In July 2012, the FASB issued update 2012-03, ASC 350,

Intangibles Goodwill and Other: Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment

.
This updated guidance provides entities with the option to make qualitative assessments about the likelihood that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired to determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment test. This standard
is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. The adoption of this standard did not have any effect upon our consolidated financial statements.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of
our large investment portfolio. As stated in our written investment policy’s objective is to achieve stable and predictable targeted rates of return, and to provide the liquidity necessary for the operation of the business.

Zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers, specified investment
liquidity levels, and broad diversification across investments, and which limits the types of investments that may be made. Moreover, the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis.

The following table sets forth the full-year impact of a one-percentage point movement in interest rates on the value of Zebra’s
investment portfolio (in thousands, except per share data).

Because these securities are classified as available-for-sale under ASC 320 (formerly SFAS No. 115,

Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

), the impact of a one-percentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We conduct
business in over 100 countries throughout the world and, therefore, at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates. On occasion, we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency
denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable. We also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies. We manage these risks using derivative financial instruments. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this form 10-K for further discussions of hedging activities.

The following table sets forth the impact of a
ten percent movement in the dollar/pound and dollar/euro rates measured as if Zebra did

not

engage in the selective hedging practices described above. It is based on the dollar/euro and dollar/pound exchange rates and euro and pound
denominated assets and liabilities (in thousands, except per share data).

Equity Price Risk

Zebra’s investment manager uses an investment strategy that is principally designed to preserve capital. Zebra utilizes a Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to determine the maximum potential one-day loss in
the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments.

From time to time, Zebra has taken direct
equity positions in companies. These investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities. To the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company, Zebra is exposed to the risks
associated with such investments.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. The evaluation was conducted under the supervision
of our Disclosure Committee, and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that (i) the information required to be disclosed by us in this Form 10-K was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or furnish under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
Based on this assessment and those criteria, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2012, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has
issued an attestation report on Zebra’s internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP’s report is included on page 43 of this report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In January 2008, Zebra began a
program to update substantially all of its key financial systems. As pieces of these systems are completed, they will be subject to the requirements related to internal control over financial reporting. The requirements for internal control over
financial reporting will be a fundamental element of the design and implementation of these systems.

As of January 31, 2011, we
completed the implementation of the new systems for our EMEA region. This implementation included customer order entry and invoicing, inventory procurement and management, certain accounts payable activity, and other related operational systems. As
part of the implementation, we changed many of the related internal controls, primarily by replacing manual controls with system controls and streamlining Zebra’s internal operations. These new controls were subject to testing throughout
2011and 2012.

As of February 27, 2012, we completed the implementation of the new systems for our North America region. This
implementation included customer order entry and invoicing, inventory procurement and management, certain accounts payable activity, and other related operational systems. As part of the implementation, we changed many of the related internal
controls substantially by reducing the number of manual controls with system controls and streamlining Zebra’s internal operations. These new controls were subject to testing throughout 2012.



During 2012, we made additional changes to our controls and procedures as part of our ongoing monitoring of
our controls. None of these changes has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, there were no other changes that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our
internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Zebra have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Zebra Technologies Corporation:

We have
audited Zebra Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Zebra Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Zebra Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Zebra Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, our report dated February 21, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Zebra Technologies Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Zebra Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in Index at Item 15. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Zebra Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Zebra Technologies Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2013 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 Description of Business

Zebra Technologies Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (Zebra) design, manufacture, sell and support a broad range of direct
thermal and thermal transfer label printers, radio frequency identification printer/encoders, dye sublimation card printers, real-time locating solutions, related accessories and support software. These products are used principally in automatic
identification (auto ID), data collection and personal identification applications and are distributed world-wide through a network of resellers, distributors and end users representing a wide cross-section of industrial, service and government
organizations.

In 2008 and 2007, we acquired WhereNet Corp., proveo AG, Navis Holdings, LLC (Navis) and Multispectral Solutions Inc., which
we referred to as Zebra Enterprise Solutions Group (ZES). On January 31, 2011, we announced a definitive agreement to sell the Navis operations and certain other assets of ZES. Upon completion of the transaction we consolidated the remaining
operations of ZES and no longer report ZES as a separate segment since it is not greater than 10% of Zebra’s consolidated totals.

Reclassifications.

Prior-period amounts will differ from amounts previously reported because certain immaterial amounts in the prior years’
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.

Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation.

These consolidated financial statements were prepared on a consolidated basis to include the
accounts of Zebra and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts, transactions and unrealized profit were eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal Calendar.

Zebra operates on a 4 week/4 week/5 week fiscal quarter, and each fiscal quarter ends on a Saturday. The fiscal year always begins on January 1 and ends on December 31.
This fiscal calendar results in some fiscal quarters being either greater than or less than 13 weeks, depending on the days of the week those dates fall. During the 2012 fiscal year, our quarter end dates were as follows:

•

March 31,

•

June 30,

•

September 29, and

•

December 31.

Use
of Estimates.

These consolidated financial statements were prepared using estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash consists primarily of deposits with banks. In addition, Zebra considers highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of less than three months to be
cash equivalents. These highly liquid short-term investments are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of a change in value because of changes in interest rates.

Investments and Marketable Securities.

Investments and marketable securities at December 31, 2012, consisted of U.S. government and agency
securities, state and municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and other security interests. Trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Held-to-maturity securities are those debt securities that
Zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. All securities not included in trading or held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale. Trading and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Held-to-maturity
securities are recorded at amortized cost, adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums. Unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the
related tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized, unless we determine them to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

Zebra’s investments and marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale securities except for securities held in Zebra’s deferred
compensation plan which are considered trading securities. Investments in marketable debt securities are classified based on intent and ability to sell investment securities. Zebra’s available-for-sale securities are used to fund further
acquisitions and other operating needs and therefore can be sold prior to maturity. Investments in marketable debt securities for which Zebra intends to sell within the next year are classified as current and those that we intend to hold in
excess of one-year are classified as non-current.

F-8


Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.

Accounts receivable consist primarily of
amounts due to us from our normal business activities. Collateral on trade accounts receivable is generally not required. Zebra maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable. The allowance is based on
our assessment of known delinquent accounts. Accounts are written off against the allowance account when they are determined to be no longer collectible.

Inventories.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, and cost is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Manufactured inventories consist of the following costs:
component, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. Purchased inventories consist of purchased costs and purchasing overhead.

Property and
Equipment.

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment, which are 30 years for
buildings and range from 3 to 10 years for other property. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.

Income Taxes.

Zebra’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense.
During 2012 Zebra recognized an increase of $680,000 in the liability for tax benefits related to the foreign restructuring.

A reconciliation
of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):

Goodwill and Other Intangibles.

Goodwill represents the unamortized excess of the cost of acquiring a business
over the fair values of the net assets received at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill of a reporting unit should be tested for impairment
between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Examples of such events or circumstances include:

•

Significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate,

•

Adverse action or assessment by a regulator,

•

Unanticipated competition,

•

Loss of key personnel,

•

More-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of,

•

Testing for recoverability under ASC 360 of a significant asset group within a reporting unit,

•

Recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statement of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit, or

•

Allocation of a portion of goodwill to a business to be disposed of.

We evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors considered that might trigger an
impairment review consist of:

•

Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results,

•

Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business,

•

Significant negative industry or economic trends,

•

Significant decline in Zebra’s stock price for a sustained period, and

•

Significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value.

If we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform an impairment test. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment
test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using three valuation methods: Income Approach –
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, Market Approach – Guideline Public Company Method, and Market Approach – Comparative Transactions Method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform
the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying
value of that goodwill.

F-9


We performed our annual impairment test in June 2012 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of
the end of May 2012. Zebra has two reporting units required for its annual goodwill impairment test. As of our May 2012 testing date, the larger of the two reporting units’ fair value exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount. The
fair value amount by which the second smaller reporting unit exceeded the carrying value ranged from approximately 8% under the Income Approach and 31% under the Market Approach. Key assumptions used in the first step of the goodwill impairment test
were determined by management utilizing the internal operating plan. The key assumptions utilized included forecasted growth rates for revenues and operating expenses as well as a discount rate which is determined by looking at current risk-free
rates of capital, current market interest rates, and the evaluation of a risk premium relevant to the business segment. Due to the deterioration in the smaller reporting unit’s operating results during the third quarter our fair value
calculation for the smaller reporting unit changed and we determined our goodwill associated with the smaller reporting unit to be impaired. The above impairment indicators led us to conclude an interim goodwill test was necessary. Zebra performed
the first step of the impairment test which failed. As a result, Zebra also performed a second step analysis and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $9,114,000 as of September 29, 2012. After this impairment charge, there is no remaining
goodwill in the smaller reporting unit.

Other intangible assets capitalized consist primarily of current technology, customer relationships,
patents and patent rights. These assets are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average life of 5.3 years, which approximates the estimated useful lives. Weighted average lives remaining by intangible asset class
are as follows: Current technology 4.0 years; Patent and patent rights 4.4 years; Customer relationships 7.3 years.

Revenue
Recognition

. Revenue includes sales of hardware, supplies, software and services (including repair services, extended service contracts, and professional services). Product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met: (1) we have
persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits; (2) delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer, which happens at the point of shipment provided that no significant obligations remain; (3) the price is fixed and determinable;
and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We provide for an estimate of product returns based on historical experience. Revenue related to extended warranty and service contracts is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the life
of the contract. Professional services revenue is recorded when performed. Zebra enters into sales transactions that include more than one product type. This bundle of products might include printers, current or future supplies, and services. When
this type of transaction occurs, we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products determined by vendor specific objective evidence. The revenue for each individual product is then recognized when
the earning process for that product is complete. We enter into post-contract maintenance and support agreements. Revenues are recognized ratably over the service period and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred.

Zebra records payments to resellers of its product as reductions to revenue unless these payments meet the requirements for operating expense treatment
under ASC 605. See the market development funds accounting policy for further details.

Revenue includes all customer billings for shipping
and handling charges. The related costs of shipping and handling revenue are recorded as cost of goods sold.

Research and Development
Costs.

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These costs include:

•

Salaries, benefits, and other R&D personnel related costs,

•

Consulting and other outside services used in the R&D process,

•

Engineering supplies,

•

Engineering related information systems costs, and

•

Allocation of building and related costs.

Advertising.

Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising costs totaled $8,983,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012, $8,070,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $6,836,000
for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Market Development Funds.

Zebra makes market development funds available to its resellers
to support demand generation activity by the resellers. These funds require the reseller to provide specific services or benefits to Zebra and substantiate the fair value of such services rendered. Zebra reimburses resellers for agreed activities up
to the amounts approved by Zebra. These payments are treated as marketing costs consistent with the requirements of ASC 605. Any payments to resellers that do not meet these requirements are recorded as reductions to revenue.

F-10


Warranty.

In general, Zebra provides warranty coverage of one year on printers against defects in
material and workmanship. Printheads are warranted for nine months and batteries are warranted for twelve months. Battery based products, such as location tags, are covered by a 30 day warranty. A provision for warranty expense is recorded at the
time of sale and adjusted quarterly based on historical warranty experience. The following table is a summary of Zebra’s accrued warranty obligation (in thousands):

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

Zebra estimates the fair value of its financial instruments as follows:

In accordance with ASC 815 we recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities on
the balance sheet and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. See Note 11 for
additional information on our derivatives and hedging activities.

Equity-Based Compensation.

At December 31, 2012, Zebra had a
general equity-based compensation plan and a stock purchase plan under which shares of our common stock were available for future grants and sales, and which are described more fully in Note 16. We account for these plans in accordance with ASC 505
and ASC 718. Zebra recognizes compensation costs using the straight-line method over the vesting period of upon grant to up to 5 years.

The
compensation expense and the related income tax benefit for share-based payments were included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings as follows (in thousands):

ASC 505 and ASC 718 requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits from tax deductions in excess of the
compensation cost recognized (excess tax benefits) to be classified as cash flows from financing activities. Cash flows resulting from the tax benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized (excess tax benefits) are
classified as financing cash flows in the statement of cash flows. The tax benefits classified as financing cash flows was $1,578,000 as of December 31, 2012, $1,392,000 as of December 31, 2011, and $244,000 as of December 31, 2010.

F-11


Deferred Compensation Plan.

Zebra has a deferred compensation plan that permits directors, management
and highly compensated employees to defer portions of their compensation. Zebra immediately pays deferred amounts into a Rabbi Trust, and plan participants select a method of investing these funds into hypothetical investments. Zebra tracks the
performance of these hypothetical investments in order to determine the value of each participant’s deferral. Zebra accrues the deferred compensation liability in other long-term liabilities as the amount that is actually owed to the
participants.

Foreign Currency Translation.

The consolidated balance sheets of Zebra’s foreign subsidiaries, not having a U.S.
dollar functional currency, are translated into U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rate, and statement of earnings items are translated using the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting translation gains or losses are recorded in
stockholders’ equity as a cumulative translation adjustment, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Acquisition Costs.

Zebra expenses acquisition costs as incurred.

Concentration risks.

Final assembly of our thermal printers is performed by Jabil Circuit, a third-party electronics manufacturer. We are now dependent on Jabil for the manufacture of such
printers. A failure by Jabil to provide manufacturing services to Zebra as Zebra now requires, or any disruption in such manufacturing services, may adversely affect Zebra’s business results. Because we rely on a third-party provider such as
Jabil to manufacture its products, Zebra may incur increased business continuity risks.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed of

. Zebra accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350. The statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use and the eventual disposition of the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. See Note 8 for further information related to impairment charges.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

In June 2011, the FASB issued update 2011-05,
ASC 220,

Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income

and in December 2011, the FASB issued update 2011-12, ASC 220,

Comprehensive Income: Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications
of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.

ASU No. 2011-12 is to defer only those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments.
Entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before ASU No. 2011-05. All other requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 are not affected
by ASU No. 2011-12, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. This standard is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard moved the Other Comprehensive Income statement disclosure from our footnote to its own financial statement for our 10-Q filings in 2012.

In September 2011, the FASB issued update 2011-08, ASC 350,

Intangibles Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment

. This updated guidance
simplifies how companies test goodwill for impairment. Essentially, companies are no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its
carrying amount using a qualitative assessment. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have any effect upon our consolidated financial statements.

In July 2012, the FASB issued update 2012-03, ASC 350,

Intangibles Goodwill and Other: Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for
Impairment

. This updated guidance provides entities with the option to make qualitative assessments about the likelihood that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired to determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment
test. This standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. The adoption of this standard did not have any effect upon our consolidated financial statements.

Subsequent events

. We have evaluated subsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the
financial statements through the date the financial statements were issued.

F-12


Note 3 Fair Value Measurements

Financial assets and liabilities are to be measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value is based on
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Zebra uses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs
used to measure fair value into three broad levels:

In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in the assessment of fair value. Included in our investment portfolio at December 31, 2012, is an auction rate security which is classified as
available for sale and is reflected at fair value. Due to events in credit markets, however, the auction event for the instrument held by Zebra is failed. Therefore, the fair value of this security is estimated utilizing broker quotations,
discounted cash flow analysis or other types of valuation adjustment methodologies at December 31, 2012. These analyses consider, among other items, the collateral underlying the security instruments, the creditworthiness of the counterparty,
the timing of expected future cash flows, estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction, and Zebra’s intent and ability to hold such securities until credit markets improve. The security was also compared,
when possible, to other securities with similar characteristics.

The decline in the market value of the auction rate security is considered
temporary and has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on Zebra’s balance sheet. Since Zebra has the intent and ability to hold this auction rate security until it is sold at auction, redeemed at carrying value or
reach maturity, we have classified it as a long-term investment on the balance sheet.

Fair value of balance sheet hedges are calculated at the period end exchange rate adjusted for current forward points unless the hedge has been traded but not settled
at period end. If this is the case, the fair value is calculated at the rate at which the hedge is being settled.

Note 4 Investments and Marketable Securities

Investments in marketable debt securities are classified based on intent and ability to sell investment securities. Zebra’s
available-for-sale securities are used to fund further acquisitions and other operating needs and therefore can be sold prior to maturity. Investments in marketable debt securities for which Zebra intends to sell within the next year are
classified as current and those that we intend to hold in excess of one-year are classified as non-current.

Changes in the market value of
available-for-sale securities are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income caption of stockholders’ equity in the balance sheet, until we dispose of the securities. Once these securities are disposed of, either by sale or
maturity, the accumulated changes in market value are transferred to investment income. On the statement of cash flows, changes in the balances of

available-for-sale

securities are shown as purchases, sales and maturities of investments and
marketable securities under investing activities.

Changes in market value of

trading

securities would be recorded in investment income
as they occur, and the related cash flow statement includes changes in the balances of trading securities as operating cash flows.

Note 10 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

In December 2012, Zebra began a plan to restructure its Location Solutions business management structure and announced a project to
further optimize our manufacturing operations costs, which includes the consolidation and relocation of support functions. The costs below incurred for the year ended December 31, 2012 represent the costs related to the restructuring of
Location solutions business management structure. The costs expected to be incurred relate to the restructuring of Zebra’s manufacturing operations and relocation of this portion of Zebra’s business from the U.S. to China and consolidating
some activities domestically.

As of December 31, 2012, we have incurred the following exit and restructuring costs related to the
location solutions business management structure and manufacturing operations relocation and restructuring (in thousands):

In January 2011, we announced an agreement to sell Navis, to Cargotec Corporation. Following the transaction which was
completed on March 18, 2011, we retained the location solutions products from the former ZES, which includes active RFID real-time location solutions and associated tags and readers. In the first quarter of 2011, we also announced a plan to
consolidate any remaining administrative and accounting functions from the former ZES into our corporate facilities in Illinois. The costs below incurred for the year ended December 31, 2011, represent the costs related to the consolidation and
relocation of the administrative and accounting functions. There are no costs in 2012 related to this restructuring as this project was completed in 2011.

As of December 31, 2012, we have incurred the following exit and restructuring costs related to consolidating the former ZES administrative and accounting function into our corporate facilities (in
thousands):

Liabilities and expenses related to exit activities were as follows (in thousands):

Liabilities related to exit activities are included in the accrued liabilities line item on the balance sheet. Exit costs

Note 11 Derivative Instruments

Portions of our operations are subject to fluctuations in currency values. We manage these risks using derivative financial
instruments. We conduct business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries,
foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows. We attempt to hedge transaction
exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign exchange forward and option contracts with third parties.

Credit and market risk

Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counter
party credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to interest and currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures
to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are commercial banks with significant experience using derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our
derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We continually monitor the
creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

Zebra has determined that derivative instruments for hedges that have traded but have not settled are considered Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, and
hedges that have not traded are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Derivative instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Our
foreign currency exchange contracts are valued using broker quotations or market transactions, in either the listed or over-the-counter markets.

Hedging of Net Assets

We use forward contracts to manage exposure related to our pound and
euro denominated net assets. Forward contracts typically mature within three months after execution of the contracts. We record gains and losses on these contracts and options in income each quarter along with the transaction gains and losses
related to our net asset positions, which would ordinarily offset each other.

Summary financial information related to these activities
included in our consolidated statement of earnings as other income (expense) is as follows (in thousands):

F-20


Hedging of Anticipated Sales

We can manage the exchange rate risk of anticipated euro-denominated sales using purchased options, forward contracts, and participating forwards. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges which
mature within twelve months after the execution of the contracts. Gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in other comprehensive income until the contracts are settled and the hedged sales are realized. The deferred gains or losses will
then be reported as an increase or decrease to sales.

Summary financial information related to the cash flow hedges is as follows (in
thousands):

Letters of Credit.

In connection with various customer contracts, Zebra has entered into two letters of credit agreements with a bank. The contingent liability of Zebra under these agreements as of
December 31, 2012, is $482,000. See below for letters of credit related to our revolving credit agreement.

Revolving Credit
Agreement.

On October 10, 2012, Zebra entered into a revolving credit agreement for a five-year $250,000,000 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by J. P. Morgan Securities LLC as Administrative Agent. The funds under
this credit facility are available for general corporate purposes of Zebra and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and other purposes permitted by the agreement.

This credit agreement is guaranteed by certain of Zebra’s domestic subsidiaries. Loans under the agreement bear interest at a rate equal to a spread over the base rate, which base rate is the greater
of: the prime rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus one-half of one percent (0.50%), or an adjusted LIBOR rate, plus one percent (1%). The spread is dependent on Zebra’s ratio of Total Debt to EBITDA, and ranges from 0.25% to 1.75%. The
spread in effect at closing for prime rate and Federal Funds based loans was 0.00%. The spread for LIBOR-based loans ranges from 1.00% to 1.75%. The spread in effect at closing for LIBOR-based loans was 1.00%. Zebra did not make any barrow any
monies under the New Credit Agreement at the time of closing.

The credit agreement includes customary representations, warranties,
affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. It also contains financial covenants tied to Zebra’s leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2012, we had established letters of credit amounting to
$2,300,000, which reduce the funds available for borrowing under the agreement. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, no amounts were outstanding under the company’s credit agreement.

The credit agreement above replaced Zebra’s August 2008 five year $100,000,000 credit agreement.

Legal Proceedings.

We are subject to a variety of investigations, claims, suits and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including but not
limited to, intellectual property, employment, tort and breach of contract matters. We currently believe that the outcomes of such proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows,
financial position, or results of operations. Any legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and management’s view of these matters and their potential effects may change in the future.

F-22


Note 13 Savings and Profit Sharing Plans

Zebra has a Retirement Savings and Investment Plan (401(k) Plan), which is intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Qualified employees may participate in Zebra’s 401(k) Plan by contributing up to 15% of their gross earnings to the plan subject to certain Internal Revenue Service restrictions. Zebra matches 100% of the first 2% of
gross eligible earnings, and also match the next 4% of gross eligible earnings at the rate of 50%. Zebra may contribute additional amounts to its 401(k) Plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain legal limits.

Company contributions to these plans, which were charged to operations, approximated the following (in thousands):

Note 14 Stockholders’ Equity

Share count and par value data related to stockholders’ equity are as follows:

During the year ended December 31, 2012, Zebra purchased 1,473,863 shares of common stock for $54,373,000 under
board authorized share repurchase plans compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, in which Zebra purchased 4,353,801 shares of common stock for $160,200,000. During the year ended December 31, 2010, Zebra purchased 3,349,286 shares of

Note 15 Earnings (Loss) Per Share

For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, earnings (loss) per share were computed as follows (in thousands, except
per-share amounts):

The potentially dilutive securities that were excluded from the earnings (loss) per share calculation consist of stock
options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) with an exercise price greater than the average market price of the Class A Common Stock. These options were as follows:

Note 16 Equity-Based Compensation

As of December 31, 2012, Zebra had a general equity-based compensation plan and a stock purchase plan under which shares of our
common stock were available for future grants and sales, and which are described below.

On May 19, 2011, Zebra’s stockholders
approved the 2011 Zebra Technologies Corporation Long Term Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan), which included authorization for issuance of awards of 5,500,000 shares under the 2011 Plan. The 2011 Plan became effective immediately and superseded the
2006 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2006 Plan), the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan) and the 2002 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (the 2002 Director Plan), except that the prior plans will remain in effect with respect to awards
granted under the prior plans until such awards have been exercised, forfeited, cancelled, expired or otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms of such grants. The types of awards available under the 2011 Plan are incentive stock options,
nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, performance shares and units and performance-based cash bonuses. Employees, directors and consultants of Zebra and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the
2011 Plan. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the plan. As of December 31, 2012, 4,805,599 shares were available for grant under the plan, and options for 438,671 shares were outstanding under the 2011 Plan.

The options and SARs granted under the 2011 Plan have an exercise or grant price equal to the closing market price of Zebra’s stock on
the date of grant. Options and SAR’s generally vest over a four or five-year period. These awards expire on the earlier of (a) ten years following the grant date, (b) immediately if the employee is terminated for cause,
(c) ninety days after termination of employment if the employee is terminated involuntarily other than for cause, (d) thirty days after termination of employment if the employee voluntarily terminates his or her employment, or (e) one
year after termination of employment if the employee’s employment terminates due to death, disability, or retirement.

F-24


Zebra’s time-vested restricted stock grants consist of restricted stock awards (RSA’s) and
performance share awards (PSA’s). The following table shows the number of shares of time-vested restricted stock granted in 2012 and the vesting schedules of the restricted stock awards that were granted under the Plan to certain executive
officers and other members of management.

These RSA’s will vest at each vesting date if the employee remains employed by Zebra throughout the applicable time
period, but will vest in whole or in part (as set forth in each Restricted Stock Agreement) before the end of the each vesting period in the event of death, disability, resignation for good reason, a change in control (as defined in the 2011 Plan),
or termination by Zebra other than for Cause, as defined in the Restricted Stock Agreement entered into by Zebra with each employee who was granted restricted stock. The restricted stock is forfeited in certain situations specified in the Restricted
Stock Agreement, including, if the employee’s employment is terminated by Zebra for Cause or if the employee resigns for other than good reason. Zebra’s restricted stock awards are expensed over the vesting period of the related award,
which is typically three to five years. However, some recent awards vested upon grant. Compensation cost is calculated as the market date fair value on grant date multiplied by the number of shares granted.

The 2006 Plan was superseded by the 2011 Plan. As of December 31, 2012, options and SARs for 1,830,544 shares were outstanding and exercisable under
the 2006 Plan. These options and SARs expire on the earlier of (a) ten years following the grant date, or (b) immediately if the employee is terminated for cause, (c) ninety days after termination of employment if the employee is
terminated involuntarily other than for cause, (d) thirty days after termination of employment if the employee voluntarily terminates his or her employment, or (e) one year after termination of employment if the employee’s employment
terminates due to death, disability, or retirement.

The 1997 Plan was superseded by the 2006 Plan. As of December 31, 2012, options for
705,445 shares were outstanding and exercisable under the 1997 Plan. These options terms are the same as noted in the paragraph above in the 2006 Plan.

The 2002 Director Plan was superseded by the 2006 Plan. As of December 31, 2012, options for 80,000 shares were outstanding and exercisable under the 2002 Director Plan. Unless otherwise provided in
an option agreement, options granted under the 2002 Director Plan become exercisable in five equal increments beginning on the date of the grant and continuing on each of the four anniversaries thereafter. All such options expire on the earlier of
(a) ten years following the grant date, (b) the first anniversary of the termination date of the non-employee director’s directorship for any reason other than the termination of the non-employee director’s directorship by
Zebra’s stockholders for cause, or resignation for cause, in each case as defined in the option agreement.

In connection with
Zebra’s acquisition of WhereNet, Zebra assumed existing unvested stock options exercisable for shares of WhereNet’s common stock and converted them into options exercisable for Zebra common stock. These converted options have exercise
prices and vesting dates based on their previous terms and all of these options that are outstanding are fully vested. As of December 31, 2012, outstanding WhereNet options were exercisable into 12,988 shares of Zebra Class A Common Stock.

On May 19, 2011 Zebra’s stockholders adopted the 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (which replaced the 2001 Stock Purchase plan)
under which employees who work a minimum of 20 hours per week may elect to withhold up to 10% of their cash compensation through regular payroll deductions to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock from Zebra over a period not to exceed 12
months at a purchase price per share which is equal to the lesser of: (1) 95% of the fair market value of the shares as of the date of the grant, or (2) 95% of the fair market value of the shares as of the date of purchase. Stock purchase
plan expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $242,000. Stock purchase plan expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $321,000 and for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $315,000.

F-25


For purposes of calculating the compensation cost, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using a
binomial model. Volatility is based on an average of the implied volatility in the open market and the annualized volatility of Zebra’s stock prices over our entire stock history. Stock option grants in the table below include both stock
options, all of which were non-qualified, and stock appreciation rights (SAR) that will be settled in Zebra stock. The following table shows the weighted-average assumptions used for grants of SARs as well as the fair value of the grants based on
those assumptions:

The forfeiture rate is based on the historical annualized forfeiture rate, which is consistent with prior year rates.
This rate includes only pre-vesting forfeitures. Volatility is based on an average of the implied volatility in the open market and the annualized volatility of Zebra’s stock prices over our entire stock history. The risk free interest rate
used is the implied yield currently available from the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve over the contractual term of the options. The expected weighted-average life is based on historical exercise behavior, which combines the average life of
the options that have already been exercised or cancelled with the exercise life of all unexercised options. The exercise life of unexercised options assumes that the option will be exercised at the midpoint of the vesting date and the full
contractual term. These assumptions are consistent with the assumptions used in prior years.

Stock option activity for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, was as follows:

There were no stock options granted in 2012, 2011 or 2010.

F-26


SAR activity for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, was as follows:

The terms of the SARs are established under the applicable Plan and the applicable SAR agreement. Once vested, a SAR
entitles the holder to receive a payment equal to the difference between the per-share grant price of the SAR and the fair market value of a share of Zebra stock on the date the SAR is exercised, multiplied by the number of shares covered by the
SAR. Exercised SARs will be settled in whole shares of Zebra stock, and any fraction of a share will be settled in cash. Vesting of SARs granted in 2012 is as follows: 20,155 SARs vested upon grant and 410,885 SARs vest annually in four equal
amounts on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date. Vesting of SARs granted in 2011 is as follows: 16,045 SARs vested after one year, 371,802 SARs vest annually in four equal amounts on each of the first four anniversaries of the
grant date. All SARs expire 10 years after the grant date.

Performance share award activity, granted under the 2011 and 2006 Plans, for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was as follows:

As of December 31, 2012, there was $18,534,000 of unearned compensation cost related to awards granted under
Zebra’s equity-based compensation plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years.

The fair value
of the purchase rights issued to Zebra employees under the stock purchase plan is estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions for purchase rights granted. Expected lives of three months to one year have been used along with these
assumptions.

Note 17 Deferred Compensation Plan

Zebra offers a deferred compensation plan that permits directors and executive management employees to defer portions of their
compensation and to select a method of investing these funds. The salaries that have been deferred since the plan’s inception have been accrued and the only expense, other than salaries, related to this plan is the gain or loss from the changes
to the deferred compensation liability, which is charged to compensation expense. To fund this plan, Zebra purchases mutual funds in the form of stock or bond funds.

The following table shows the income, asset and liability amounts related to this plan (in thousands):

Note 18 Income Taxes

The geographical sources of income before income taxes were as follows (in thousands):

F-28


Zebra earns a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently
reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. Zebra does not currently foresee a need to repatriate funds, however, should Zebra require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations locally, Zebra could elect to repatriate funds held in
foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense.

Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $256,000,000 at December 31, 2012 and $175,000,000 at December 31, 2011.

The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory Federal income tax rate of
35% to income before income taxes. The reconciliation of statutory and effective income taxes is presented below (in thousands):

In conjunction with the opening of Zebra’s Singapore distribution center and the establishment of Singapore as a
regional headquarter location in 2009, Zebra negotiated a 10% income tax rate with the Singapore Economic Development Board. The negotiated rate is a reduction from the then current statutory rate of 17%. The 10% rate expires at the end of 2014
unless Zebra meets agreed commitments for employees and business expenditures in Singapore. If these requirements are met, the 10% rate extends through 2018. This agreement reduced Zebra’s consolidated income taxes by $2,002,000 in 2012,
$2,030,000 in 2011, and $1,247,000 in 2010.

Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws. Based on management’s assessment, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings.

F-29


Tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows
(in thousands):

On January 1, 2007, Zebra adopted ASC 740 (formerly FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48,

Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

). According to ASC 740, Zebra identified, evaluated, and measured the amount of income tax benefits to be recognized for all of its income tax positions. During
2008, Zebra recognized an increase of approximately $4,000,000 in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to an acquisition. During 2012 Zebra recognized an increase of $680,000 in one of its UK subsidiaries.

Included in deferred tax assets are amounts related to federal and state net operating losses that resulted from our acquisition of WhereNet Corp. As of
December 31, 2012, Zebra had approximately $2,518,000 of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which expire in 2022 through 2027. As of December 31, 2011, Zebra also had approximately
$27,391,000 of state net operating loss carryforwards which expire in 2013 through 2021. Zebra’s intention is to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income tax expense. Under the United States Tax Reform Act of 1986,
the amounts of benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances, including significant changes in ownership interests.

Deferred tax asset valuation allowances included in the temporary differences above are as follows (in thousands):

Zebra’s deferred tax valuation allowance is the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded
tax benefits on state income tax loss carry-forwards. The addition in 2010 is primarily related to state income tax law changes in 2011 for that year and tax years going forward.

An audit of U.S. federal tax returns for years 2008 through 2010 was completed in 2012. The tax years 2008 through 2010 remain open to examination by multiple state taxing jurisdictions. Tax authorities
in the United Kingdom have completed income tax audits for tax years through 2009.

F-30


Zebra’s continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters as
part of income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, Zebra did not accrue any interest or penalties into income tax expense.

Note 19 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Stockholders’ equity contains certain items classified as other comprehensive income (loss), including:

•

Foreign currency translation adjustments

related to our non-U.S. subsidiary companies that have designated a functional currency other than the
dollar. We are required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to dollars using a combination of historical, month-end, and average foreign exchange rates. This combination of rates creates the foreign currency
translation adjustments component of other comprehensive income (loss).

•

Unrealized holding gains (losses) on foreign currency hedging activities

Sale of proveo AG -

On August 3, 2011, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with F Two NV (a Belgium company) to sell all of our
interest in Zebra Enterprise Solutions GmbH (formerly proveo AG) business. The loss recorded upon divestiture was $1,248,000. As part of the sale, Zebra agreed with the buyer to provide a revolving loan of up to €1,000,000 which was due on
August 3, 2012 and bore interest at 6.5%. Zebra realized tax benefits in the amount of $13,308,000 with the divestiture of proveo AG. These tax benefits are primarily related to the difference in book basis versus tax basis. On June 29,
2012 F Two NV (a Belgium company) sold the business and assigned the revolving loan to OBQ SA (a Luxembourg company) with Zebra’s consent. The revolving loan commitment was reduced to a lesser amount of up to €526,058. The due date for
borrowings under the agreement was extended from August 3, 2012 to December 31, 2012. The interest rate remains unchanged at 6.5%. In 2012, Zebra realized a gain of $930,000 related to payments received under the loan agreement. The
