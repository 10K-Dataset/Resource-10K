INTRODUCTION

Filing Format

This Annual Report on Form 10-K is a combined report being filed by two separate registrants:
Pinnacle West and APS. The information required with respect to each company is set forth within
the applicable items.

The Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
included under Item 7 of this report is divided into the following two sections:

•

Pinnacle West Consolidated

—This section describes the financial condition and
results of operations of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
It includes discussions of Pinnacle West’s regulated utility and non-utility
operations. A substantial part of Pinnacle West’s revenues and earnings are derived
from its regulated utility, APS.

•

APS

—This section includes a detailed description of the results of operations and
contractual obligations of APS.

Item 8 of this report includes Consolidated Financial Statements of Pinnacle West and
Financial Statements of APS. Item 8 also includes Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial
Statements, the majority of which also relate to APS, and Supplemental Notes to APS’ Financial
Statements.

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

General

Pinnacle West was incorporated in 1985 under the laws of the State of Arizona and owns all of
the outstanding equity securities of APS, its major subsidiary. APS is a vertically-integrated
electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of
Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson
metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona. Through its marketing and trading
division, APS also generates, sells and delivers electricity to wholesale customers in the western
United States.

Pinnacle West’s other significant subsidiaries are Pinnacle West Energy, which owns and
operates unregulated generating plants; APS Energy Services, which provides competitive energy
services and products in the western United States; and SunCor, which is engaged in real estate
development activities. Each of these subsidiaries is discussed in greater detail below. See
“Business of Pinnacle West Energy Corporation,” “Business of APS Energy Services Company, Inc.”
and “Business of SunCor Development Company” in this Item 1.



Business Segments

Pinnacle West has three principal business segments (determined by products, services and the
regulatory environment):

•

the regulated electricity segment (70% of operating revenues in 2004), which
consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses
(primarily electric service to Native Load customers) and related activities, and
includes electricity generation, transmission and distribution;

•

the marketing and trading segment (16% of operating revenues in 2004), which
consists of competitive energy business activities, including wholesale marketing and
trading and APS Energy Services’ commodity-related energy services; and

•

the real estate segment (12% of operating revenues in 2004), which consists of
SunCor’s real estate development and investment activities.

See Note 17 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for
financial information about the business segments.

APS General Rate Case

APS’ general rate case pending before the ACC is the key issue affecting Pinnacle West’s and
APS’ outlook. As discussed in greater detail in Note 3 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8, on August 18, 2004, a substantial majority of the parties to the
rate case, including APS, the ACC staff, the Arizona Residential Utility Consumer Office, other
customer and advocacy groups, and merchant power plant intervenors entered into the 2004 Settlement
Agreement, which proposes terms under which the rate case would be settled.

On
February 28, 2005, the administrative law judge issued a
recommended order, proposing ACC approval of the 2004 Settlement
Agreement with two changes related to the PSA.
On March 14, 2005, the parties to the 2004 Settlement Agreement jointly filed
 suggested changes to the recommended order addressing, among other things, the recommended
order’s proposed treatment of the PSA. The
ACC has scheduled open meetings on March 25 and March 28, 2005 to consider  the recommended order and
suggested changes. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

Employees

At December 31, 2004, Pinnacle West employed about 7,200 people, including the employees of
its subsidiaries. Of these employees, about 6,100 were employees of APS, including employees at
jointly-owned generating facilities for which APS serves as the generating facility manager. About
1,100 people were employed by Pinnacle West and its other subsidiaries. Pinnacle West’s principal
executive offices are located at 400 North Fifth Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85004 (telephone
602-250-1000).

Forward-Looking Statements

This document contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and neither
Pinnacle West nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements or make any further
statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking
statements are often identified by words such as “estimate,” “predict,” “hope,” “may,” “believe,”
“anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “require,” “intend,” “assume” and similar words. Because actual
results may differ materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on
these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from
historical results, or from results or outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or
APS. In addition to the “Risk Factors” described in Exhibits 99.31 and 99.32 to this report, these
factors include, but are not limited to:



REGULATION AND COMPETITION

Retail

The ACC regulates APS’ retail electric rates and its issuance of securities. The ACC must
also approve any transfer of APS’ property used to provide retail electric service and approve or
receive prior notification of certain transactions between Pinnacle West, APS and their respective
affiliates. See Note 3 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for
a discussion of the status of electric industry restructuring in Arizona.

The electric utility industry has undergone significant regulatory change in the last few
years regarding competition in the sale of electricity and related services. However, many states,
including Arizona, have reexamined retail electric competition.

As of January 1, 2001, all of APS’ retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy
suppliers. However, there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or
other utility services to APS’ customers. As a result, APS cannot predict when, and the extent to
which, additional competitors will re-enter APS’ service territory. Also, regulatory developments
and legal challenges to the Rules have raised considerable uncertainty about the status and pace of
retail electric competition and of electric restructuring in Arizona. See “Retail Electric
Competition Rules” in Note 3 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8 for additional information.



APS is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investor-owned utilities in
Arizona (such as Tucson Electric Power Company and Southwest Gas Corporation) as well as
cooperatives, municipalities, electrical districts and similar types of governmental or non-profit
organizations (principally Salt River Project). APS also faces competition from low-cost,
hydroelectric power and parties that have access to low-priced preferential, federal power and
other governmental subsidies. In addition, some customers, particularly industrial and large
commercial customers, may own and operate generation facilities to meet their own energy
requirements.

Wholesale

General

The FERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services. During 2004,
approximately 9.4% of APS’ electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services. In
early 2003, Pinnacle West moved its marketing and trading division to APS for all future marketing
and trading activities (existing wholesale contracts remained at Pinnacle West) as a result of the
ACC’s Track A Order prohibiting the previously required transfer of APS’ generating assets to
Pinnacle West Energy (see “Track A Order” in Note 3 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8).

The marketing and trading division focuses primarily on managing APS’ purchased power and fuel
risks in connection with its costs of serving retail customer energy requirements. The division
also sells, in the wholesale market, APS and Pinnacle West Energy generation output that is not
needed for APS’ Native Load and, in doing so, competes with other utilities, power marketers and
independent power producers. Additionally, the marketing and trading division, subject to
specified parameters, markets, hedges and trades in electricity, fuels and emissions allowances and
credits.

Market-Based Rate Proceeding

On August 11, 2004, Pinnacle West, APS, Pinnacle West Energy and APS Energy Services
(collectively, the “Pinnacle West Companies”) submitted to
the FERC an update to their three-year
market-based rate review, pursuant to the FERC’s order implementing a new generation market
power analysis. On December 20, 2004, the FERC issued an order approving the Pinnacle West
Companies’ market-based rates for control areas other than those of APS, Public Service Company of
New Mexico and Tucson Electric Power Company. With respect to these three control areas, the FERC
required that the Pinnacle West Companies submit additional data, and on February 18, 2005, the
Pinnacle West Companies made such a filing. To the extent the FERC does not permit the Pinnacle
West Companies to make sales at market-based rates in these control areas, the Pinnacle West
Companies will still be permitted to make sales at cost-based rates in the three control areas. We
cannot currently predict the outcome of this proceeding, but we do
not believe that having such sales
limited to cost-based rates will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

Regional Transmission Organizations

Federal

In a December 1999 order, the FERC established characteristics and functions that
must be met by utilities in forming and operating RTOs. The characteristics for an acceptable RTO
include independence from market participants, operational control over a region large enough to



support efficient and nondiscriminatory markets and exclusive authority to maintain short-term
reliability. Additionally, in a pending notice of proposed rulemaking, the FERC is considering
implementing a standard market design for wholesale markets.

On October 16, 2001, APS and other owners of electric transmission lines in the southwestern
U.S. filed with the FERC a request for a declaratory order confirming that their proposal to form
WestConnect RTO, LLC would satisfy the FERC’s requirements for the formation of an RTO. On October
10, 2002, the FERC issued an order finding that the WestConnect proposal, if modified to address
specified issues, could meet the FERC’s RTO requirements and provide the basic framework for a
standard market design for the southwestern U.S.

See Arizona Public Service Co

., 101 FERC ¶
61,033,

order on reh’g

, 101 FERC ¶ 61,350,

order on reh’g

, 104 FERC ¶ 61,285 (2003). Since that
time, APS has been evaluating a phased approach to RTO implementation in the desert Southwest. APS
is currently participating with other entities in the southwestern U.S. in a cost/benefit analysis
of implementing the WestConnect RTO, the results of which are expected to be completed in 2005.

If APS ultimately joins an RTO, APS could incur increased transmission-related costs and
receive reduced transmission service revenues; APS may be required to expand its transmission
system according to decisions made by the RTO rather than its internal planning process; and APS
may experience other impacts on its operations, cash flows or financial position that will not be
quantifiable until the final tariffs and other material terms of the RTO are known.

State

The ACC’s retail electric competition Rules require the formation and implementation of
an Arizona Independent Scheduling Administrator. The purpose of the AISA is to oversee the
application of operating protocols to ensure statewide consistency for transmission access. The
AISA is anticipated to be a temporary organization until the implementation of an independent
system operator or RTO. APS participated in the creation of the AISA, a not-for-profit entity, and
the filing at the FERC for approval of its operating protocols. An ACC proceeding reviewing the
AISA is still pending.

BUSINESS OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

General

APS was incorporated in 1920 under the laws of the State of Arizona and currently has more
than 989,500 customers. APS does not distribute any products. During 2004, no single purchaser or
user of energy (other than Pinnacle West) accounted for more than 6.2% of electric revenues. See
“Overview – General” and “Regulation and Competition” above for additional
background information about APS’ business.

At December 31, 2004, APS employed approximately 6,100 people, including employees at
jointly-owned generating facilities for which APS serves as the generating facility manager. APS’
principal executive offices are located at 400 North Fifth Street, P.O. Box 53999, Phoenix, Arizona
85072-3999 (telephone 602-250-1000).

Purchased Power and Generating Fuel

See “Properties – Capacity” in Item 2 for information about APS’ and Pinnacle West’s power
plants by fuel types.



2004 Energy Mix

Pinnacle West’s consolidated sources of energy during 2004 were: purchased power – 56.9%; coal – 20.8%; nuclear – 13.5%; gas – 8.7%; and other (includes oil, hydro
and solar) – 0.1%. In accordance with GAAP, a substantial
portion of our purchased power contracts was netted against wholesale
sales contracts on the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 18 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.

APS’
sources of energy during 2004 were: purchased power – 62.9%; coal – 21.4%; nuclear – 13.9%; gas – 1.7%; and other
(includes oil, hydro and solar) – 0.1%. In accordance with GAAP, a substantial
portion of our purchased power contracts was netted against wholesale
sales contracts on the Statements of Income. See Note 18 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8.

Coal Supply

Cholla

Cholla is a coal-fired power plant located in northeastern Arizona. It is a
jointly-owned facility operated by APS. APS purchases most of Cholla’s coal requirements from a
coal supplier that mines all of the coal under a long-term lease of coal reserves with the Navajo
Nation, the federal government and private landholders. Cholla has sufficient coal under current
contracts to ensure a reliable fuel supply through 2007. These contracts include expected
requirements for low sulfur coal, which is required for certain limited operating conditions;
however, if necessary, low sulfur coal may be purchased on the open market. APS may purchase a
portion of Cholla’s coal requirements on the spot market to take advantage of competitive pricing
options and to supplement coal required for increased operating capacity. Following expiration of
current contracts, APS believes that competitive fuel supply options will exist to ensure the
continued operation of Cholla for its useful life, and has evaluated the necessary plant
modifications and operational requirements to convert to other fuel sources.

Four Corners

Four Corners is a coal-fired power plant located in the northwestern corner of
New Mexico. It is a jointly-owned facility operated by APS. APS purchases all of Four Corners’
coal requirements from a supplier with a long-term lease of coal reserves with the Navajo Nation.
The Four Corners coal contract runs through July 2016, with options to extend the contract for five
to fifteen additional years beyond the current plant site lease expiration in 2017.

Navajo Generating Station

The Navajo Generating Station is a coal-fired power plant located
in northern Arizona. It is a jointly-owned facility operated by Salt River Project. The Navajo
Generating Station’s coal requirements are purchased from a supplier with long-term leases from the
Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe. The Navajo Generating Station is under contract with its coal
supplier through 2011, with options to extend through the current plant site lease expiration in
2019. The Navajo Generating Station lease waives certain taxes through the lease expiration in
2019. Items that may impact the fuel price include lease provisions that allow for a
renegotiation of the coal royalty in 2007 and 2017 and a fuel contract requirement for a five-year
price review in 2007. In addition, the potential closure of the Mohave Generating Station will
impact the cost structure for the Black Mesa – Kayenta Mine complex, and may increase costs to the
Navajo Generating Station, which is served by the Kayenta Mine.

See “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 for information about a lawsuit relating to royalties for
coal paid by the participants at the Navajo Generating Station.



See “Properties – Capacity” in Item 2 for information about APS’ ownership interests in
Cholla, Four Corners and the Navajo Generating Station. See Note 11 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information regarding APS’ coal mine reclamation
obligations.

Natural Gas Supply

See Note 11 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a
discussion of APS’ and Pinnacle West’s natural gas requirements.

Nuclear Fuel Supply

Palo Verde Fuel Cycle

Palo Verde is a nuclear power plant located about 50 miles west of
Phoenix, Arizona. It is a jointly-owned facility operated by APS. The fuel cycle for Palo Verde
is comprised of the following stages:

The Palo Verde participants have contracted for all of Palo Verde’s requirements for uranium
concentrates and conversion services through 2008. The Palo Verde participants have also
contracted for all of Palo Verde’s enrichment services through 2010 and fuel assembly fabrication
services until at least 2015.

Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal

See “Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station” in Note 11
of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of spent
nuclear fuel and waste disposal.

Purchased Power Agreements

In addition to its own available generating capacity (see “Properties” in Item 2), APS
purchases electricity under various arrangements. One of the most important of these is a
long-term contract with Salt River Project. The amount of electricity available to APS is based in
large part on customer demand within certain areas now served by APS pursuant to a related
territorial agreement. The generating capacity available to APS pursuant to the contract is 350
MW. In 2004, APS received approximately 568,770 MWh of energy under the contract and paid about
$54.9 million for capacity availability and energy received. This contract may be canceled by Salt
River Project on three years’ notice. By letter dated June 7, 2004, Salt River Project gave notice
to APS to reduce capacity by 150 MW effective June 16, 2007. To date, this letter is the only
notice Salt River Project has given under the contract. APS may also cancel the contract on five
years’ notice, which may be given no earlier than December 31, 2006.

In September 1990, APS entered into a thirty-year seasonal capacity exchange agreement with
PacifiCorp. Under this agreement, APS receives electricity from PacifiCorp during the summer



peak season (from May 15 to September 15) and APS returns electricity to PacifiCorp during the
winter season (from October 15 to February 15). Until 2020, APS and PacifiCorp each has 480 MW of
capacity and a related amount of energy available to it under the agreement for its respective
seasons. In 2004, APS received approximately 571,392 MWh of energy under the capacity exchange.
APS must also make additional offers of energy to PacifiCorp each year through October 31, 2020.
Pursuant to this requirement, during 2004, PacifiCorp received offers of 1,095,000 MWh and
purchased about 246,275 MWh.

Consistent with the ACC’s Track B Order, APS issued a request for proposals (“RFP”) in March
2003 and, as a result of that RFP, APS entered into contracts with three parties, including
Pinnacle West Energy, to meet a portion of APS’ capacity and energy requirements for the years 2003
through 2006. See “Track B Order” in Note 3 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 for additional information about the contracts and the Track B Order.

Construction Program

During the years 2002 through 2004, APS incurred approximately $1.4 billion in capital
expenditures. APS’ capital expenditures for the years 2005 through 2007 are expected to be
primarily for expanding transmission and distribution capabilities to meet growing customer needs,
for upgrading existing utility property and for environmental purposes. APS’ capital expenditures
were approximately $484 million in 2004. APS’ capital expenditures, including expenditures for
environmental control facilities, for the years 2005 through 2007 have been estimated as follows
(dollars in millions):

The above amounts exclude capitalized interest costs and include capitalized property taxes
and approximately $30 million per year for nuclear fuel. The estimate for 2005 includes about $190 million for
APS’ planned acquisition of the Sundance Plant. See “Request for Proposals and Asset Purchase
Agreement” in Note 3 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a
discussion of the asset purchase agreement between APS and PPL Sundance. APS conducts a continuing
review of its construction program.

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –
Capital Needs and Resources by Company” in Item 7 for additional information about APS’
construction programs.



Environmental Matters

EPA Environmental Regulation

Regional Haze Rules

On April 22, 1999, the EPA announced final regional haze rules. These
regulations require states to submit implementation plans by 2008 to eliminate all man-made
emissions causing visibility impairment in certain specified areas, including Class I Areas in the
Colorado Plateau, and to consider and potentially apply the best available retrofit technology
(“BART”) for major stationary sources.

The rules allow nine western states and tribes to follow an alternate implementation plan and
schedule for the Class I Areas. This alternate implementation plan is known as the Annex Rule.
Five western states, including Arizona, have submitted proposed State Implementation Plans
to the EPA to implement the Annex Rule.

On February 18, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a
petition for review of the Annex Rule, filed by the Center for Energy and Economic Development
(CEED).

Center for Energy and Economic Development v. the EPA

, No. 03-1222 (D.C. Cir.). APS, Phelps
Dodge Corporation, and Environmental Defense were intervenors in the
litigation in support of the EPA and the Annex
Rule. Although the Court concluded that the EPA has the authority to promulgate a BART alternative,
the Court ruled that the EPA must first conduct a BART analysis of eligible sources to demonstrate that
the alternate plan would achieve greater reductions than BART. At this time, the EPA’s response to the

CEED

decision is uncertain. The Company cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter.

On March 15, 2005, the EPA issued the
Clean Air Mercury Rule to regulate mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.  This rule establishes
performance standards limiting mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants and establishes a two phased market-based trading program.  Under the trading program, the EPA has assigned each state a "budget" for reducing coal-fired power plant mercury emissions, and each state must submit to the EPA a plan detailing how it will meet its "budget."  In the first phase of the program, beginning in 2010, mercury emissions will be reduced from a total of 48 tons per year to 38 tons.  In 2018, mercury emissions will be further reduced to 15 tons.  APS is currently evaluating the potential impact of this rule.

Federal Implementation Plan

In September 1999, the EPA proposed a FIP to set air quality
standards at certain power plants, including the Navajo Generating Station and Four Corners. The
FIP is similar to current Arizona regulation of the Navajo Generating Station and New Mexico
regulation of Four Corners, with minor modifications. APS does not currently expect the FIP to
have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Superfund

Superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found
contaminating the soil, water or air. Those who generated, transported or disposed of hazardous
substances at a contaminated site are among those who are PRPs. PRPs may be strictly, and often
jointly and severally, liable for clean-up. On September 3, 2003, the EPA advised APS that the EPA



considers APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52

nd

Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3
(OU3) in Phoenix, Arizona. APS has facilities that are within this superfund site. APS and
Pinnacle West have agreed with the EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS
facilities within OU3. Because the investigation has not yet been completed and ultimate
remediation requirements are not yet finalized, neither APS nor Pinnacle West can currently
estimate the expenditures which may be required.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

APS is currently investigating properties, which it now owns or
which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors, that were at one time sites of, or
sites associated with, manufactured gas plants. APS is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites. APS does
not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

Navajo Nation Environmental Issues

Four Corners and the Navajo Generating Station are located on the Navajo Reservation and are
held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the Navajo Nation.
APS is the Four Corners operating agent. APS owns all of Four Corners Units 1, 2 and 3, and a 15%
interest in Four Corners Units 4 and 5. APS owns a 14% interest in Navajo Generating Station Units
1, 2 and 3.

In July 1995, the Navajo Nation enacted the Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control
Act, the Navajo Nation Safe Drinking Water Act and the Navajo Nation Pesticide Act (collectively,
the Navajo Acts). The Navajo Acts purport to give the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection
Agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality, drinking water and pesticide
activities, including those activities that occur at Four Corners and the Navajo Generating
Station. On October 17, 1995, the Four Corners participants and the Navajo Generating Station
participants each filed a lawsuit in the District Court of the Navajo Nation, Window Rock District,
challenging the applicability of the Navajo Nation as to Four Corners and Navajo Generating
Station. The Court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties, and the
parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement. APS cannot currently predict the outcome of this
matter.

In February 1998, the EPA issued regulations identifying those Clean Air Act provisions for
which it is appropriate to treat Indian tribes in the same manner as states. The EPA has announced
that it has not yet determined whether the Clean Air Act would supersede pre-existing binding
agreements between the Navajo Nation and the Four Corners participants and the Navajo Generating
Station participants that limit the Navajo Nation’s environmental regulatory authority over the
Navajo Generating Station and Four Corners. APS believes that the Clean Air Act does not supersede
these pre-existing agreements. The parties have reached tentative agreement on a resolution of the
Clean Air Act issues. If such an agreement is executed by the parties and approved by the EPA, APS
would dismiss the pending litigation to the extent the claims relate to the Clean Air Act. APS
cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter.

In April 2000, the Navajo Tribal Council approved operating permit regulations under the
Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act. APS believes the regulations fail to
recognize that the Navajo Nation did not intend to assert jurisdiction over Four Corners and the
Navajo Generating Station. On July 12, 2000, the Four Corners participants and the Navajo
Generating Station participants each filed a petition with the Navajo Supreme Court for review of
the



operating permit regulations. Those proceedings have been stayed, pending the settlement
negotiations mentioned above. APS cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter.

Water Supply

Assured supplies of water are important for APS’ and Pinnacle West Energy’s generating plants.
At the present time, APS and Pinnacle West Energy have adequate water to meet their needs.
However, conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern United States have
resulted in numerous court actions.

Both groundwater and surface water in areas important to APS’ operations have been the subject
of inquiries, claims and legal proceedings, which will require a number of years to resolve. APS
is one of a number of parties in a proceeding before a state court in New Mexico to adjudicate
rights to a stream system from which water for Four Corners is derived. (

State of New Mexico,
in the relation of S.E. Reynolds, State Engineer vs. United States of America, City of Farmington,
Utah International, Inc., et al., San Juan County, New Mexico

, District Court No. 75-184). An
agreement reached with the Navajo Nation in 1985, however, provides that if Four Corners loses a
portion of its rights in the adjudication, the Navajo Nation will provide, for a then-agreed upon
cost, sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss.

A summons served on APS in early 1986 required all water claimants in the Lower Gila River
Watershed in Arizona to assert any claims to water on or before January 20, 1987, in an action
pending in Maricopa County, Arizona, Superior Court. (

In re The General Adjudication of All
Rights to Use Water in the Gila River System and Source

, Supreme Court Nos. WC-79-0001 through
WC 79-0004 (Consolidated) [WC-1, WC-2, WC-3 and WC-4 (Consolidated)], Maricopa County Nos. W-1,
W-2, W-3 and W-4 (Consolidated)). Palo Verde is located within the geographic area subject to the
summons. APS’ rights and the rights of the Palo Verde participants to the use of groundwater and
effluent at Palo Verde are potentially at issue in this action. As project manager of Palo Verde,
APS filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the Palo Verde participants’
groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to Palo Verde. Alternatively,
APS seeks confirmation of such rights. Three of APS’ other power plants and two of Pinnacle West
Energy’s power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons. APS’
claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants.
Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights. In November 1999, the Arizona Supreme Court
issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal
government and Indian tribes. In addition, in September 2000, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a
decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims. Litigation on both
of these issues will continue in the trial court. No trial date concerning APS’ water rights
claims has been set in this matter.

APS has also filed claims to water in the Little Colorado River Watershed in Arizona in an
action pending in the Apache County, Arizona, Superior Court. (

In re The General Adjudication
of All Rights to Use Water in the Little Colorado River System and Source

, Supreme Court No.
WC-79-0006 WC-6, Apache County No. 6417). APS’ groundwater resource utilized at Cholla is within
the geographic area subject to the adjudication and is therefore potentially at issue in the case.
APS’ claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights. Alternatively, APS seeks
confirmation of such rights. A number of parties are in the process of settlement negotiations
with respect to certain claims in this matter. Other claims have been identified as ready for
litigation in



motions filed with the court. No trial date concerning APS’ water rights claims has
been set in this matter.

Although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation, Pinnacle West expects that
the described litigation will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results
of operations or liquidity.

The Four Corners region, in which Four Corners is located, has been experiencing drought
conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in
the watershed that supplies the area. APS is continuing to work with area stakeholders to
implement agreements to minimize the effect, if any, on operations of the plant for 2005 and later
years. The effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time, and APS cannot predict the
ultimate outcome, if any, of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of
power available, or the price thereof, from Four Corners.

BUSINESS OF PINNACLE WEST ENERGY CORPORATION

Pinnacle West Energy was incorporated in 1999 under the laws of the State of Arizona and is
engaged principally in the operation of unregulated generating plants. Pinnacle West Energy had
approximately 100 employees as of December 31, 2004. Pinnacle West Energy’s principal offices are
located at 400 North Fifth Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85004 (telephone 602-250-4145).

See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 for a discussion of Pinnacle West Energy’s capital
requirements.

Pinnacle West Energy owns the PWEC Dedicated Assets as well as an interest in Silverhawk. The PWEC Dedicated Assets were built as a result of what APS believed was a regulatory
restriction against APS’ construction of additional plants and based on the requirement in the 1999
Settlement Agreement that APS transfer its generation assets. As discussed under “APS General Rate
Case; 2004 Settlement Agreement” in Note 3 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8, as part of the proposed settlement of APS’ general rate case, APS would
acquire the PWEC Dedicated Assets from Pinnacle West Energy. Silverhawk, which is Pinnacle West
Energy’s only power plant not included in the PWEC Dedicated Assets, is a 570 MW combined cycle
power plant located 20 miles north of Las Vegas, Nevada in which Pinnacle West Energy has a 75%
ownership interest. See “Properties” in Item 2 for a summary of the generating plants owned by
Pinnacle West Energy.

At December 31, 2004, Pinnacle West Energy had total assets of $1.3 billion, of which $1.0
billion related to the PWEC Dedicated Assets. Pinnacle West Energy had a pretax loss of $47
million in 2004, a net loss of $1 million in 2003 and a net loss of $19 million in 2002. Income
taxes related to Pinnacle West Energy were recorded by Pinnacle West in 2004.

BUSINESS OF APS ENERGY SERVICES COMPANY, INC.

APS Energy Services was incorporated in 1998 under the laws of the State of Arizona and
provides competitive commodity-related energy services (such as direct access commodity contracts,
energy procurement and energy supply consultation) and energy-related products and services (such
as energy master planning, energy use consultation and facility audits, cogeneration analysis and
installation and project management) to commercial, industrial and institutional retail customers
in



the western United States. APS Energy Services had approximately 100 employees as of December
31, 2004. APS Energy Services’ principal offices are located at 400 East Van Buren Street,
Phoenix, Arizona 85004 (telephone 602-250-5000).

APS Energy Services had net income of $3 million in 2004, net income of $16 million in 2003,
and pretax income of $28 million in 2002. Income taxes related to APS Energy Services were
recorded by Pinnacle West prior to 2003. At December 31, 2004, APS Energy Services had total
assets of $77 million.

BUSINESS OF SUNCOR DEVELOPMENT COMPANY

SunCor was incorporated in 1965 under the laws of the State of Arizona and is a developer of
residential, commercial and industrial real estate projects in Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico and Utah.
The principal executive offices of SunCor are located at 80 East Rio Salado Parkway, Suite 410,
Tempe, Arizona 85281 (telephone 480-317-6800). SunCor and its subsidiaries had approximately 800
employees at December 31, 2004.

At December 31, 2004, SunCor had total assets of about $464 million. SunCor’s assets consist
primarily of land with improvements, commercial buildings, golf courses and other real estate
investments. SunCor intends to continue its focus on real estate development of master-planned
communities, mixed-use residential, commercial, office and industrial projects.

SunCor projects under development include seven master-planned communities and several
commercial projects. The commercial projects and four of the master-planned communities are in
Arizona. Other master-planned communities are located near St. George, Utah, Boise, Idaho and
Santa Fe, New Mexico.

SunCor has implemented an accelerated asset sales program for 2003 through 2005. As a result
of this program, SunCor expects to have net income of approximately $50 million in 2005. SunCor
also expects to make a cash distribution of approximately $80 million to $100 million to the parent
in 2005.

For the past three years, SunCor’s operating revenues were approximately: $360 million in
2004; $362 million in 2003; and $201 million in 2002. SunCor’s net income was approximately $45
million in 2004; $56 million in 2003; and $19 million in 2002. Certain components of SunCor’s real
estate sales activities, which are included in the real estate segment, are required to be reported
as discontinued operations on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” See Note 22 of
Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

See Note 6 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for
information regarding SunCor’s long-term debt and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7
for a discussion of SunCor’s capital requirements.

BUSINESS OF EL DORADO INVESTMENT COMPANY

El Dorado was incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Arizona. El Dorado owns
minority interests in several energy-related investments and Arizona community-based ventures. El



Dorado’s short-term goal is to prudently realize the value of its existing investments. On a
long-term basis, Pinnacle West may use El Dorado, when appropriate, for investments that are
strategic to the business of generating, distributing and marketing electricity. El Dorado’s
offices are located at 400 North Fifth Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85004 (telephone 602-250-3517).

El Dorado had pretax income of $40 million in 2004, pretax income of $7 million in 2003, and a
pretax loss of $55 million in 2002. Pinnacle West records income taxes related to El Dorado. El
Dorado sold its investment in NAC on November 18, 2004, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4
million and is classified as discontinued operations in 2004. All
related revenue and expenses for NAC have been reclassified to
discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002 (see Note 22 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). In addition, the year ended 2004
includes a $35 million gain ($21 million after tax) related to the sale of El Dorado’s limited
partnership interest in the Phoenix Suns. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 for additional information. At December 31, 2004,
El Dorado had total assets of $23 million.



ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Capacity

APS’ and Pinnacle West Energy’s generating facilities are described below. For APS’ plants,
the “net accredited capacities” are reported, consistent with industry practice for regulated

Reserve Margin

APS’ 2004 peak one-hour demand on its electric system was recorded on August 11, 2004 at
6,402,100 kW, compared to the 2003 peak of 6,332,400 kW recorded on July 14, 2003. Taking into
account additional capacity then available to APS under long-term purchase power contracts as well
as APS’ and Pinnacle West Energy’s generating capacity, APS’ capability of meeting system demand on
August 11, 2004, amounted to 6,388,600 kW, for an installed reserve margin of negative 0.3%. The
power actually available to APS from its resources fluctuates from time to time due in part to
planned and unplanned plant and transmission outages and technical
problems. The available capacity from sources actually
operable at the time of the 2004 peak amounted to 3,570,600 kW, for a margin of negative 52.6%.
Firm purchases totaling 4,187,000 kW, including short-term seasonal purchases and unit contingent
purchases, were in place at the time of the peak, ensuring the ability to meet the load requirement
with an actual reserve margin of 6.9 %.

See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company – Purchased Power and Generating Fuel –
Purchased Power Agreements” in Item 1 for information about certain of APS’ long-term power
agreements.

Plant Sites Leased from Navajo Nation

The Navajo Generating Station and Four Corners are located on land held under easements from
the federal government and also under leases from the Navajo Nation. These are long-term
agreements with options to extend, and APS does not believe that the risks with respect to
enforcement of these easements and leases are material. The majority of coal contracted for use in
these plants and certain associated transmission lines are also located on Indian reservations.
See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company – Purchased Power and Generating Fuel – Coal
Supply” in Item 1.

Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station

Regulatory

Operation of each of the three Palo Verde units requires an operating license from the NRC.
The NRC issued full power operating licenses for Unit 1 in June 1985, Unit 2 in April 1986 and Unit
3 in November 1987. The full power operating licenses, each valid for a period of approximately 40
years, authorize APS, as operating agent for Palo Verde, to operate the three Palo Verde units at
full power.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

The NRC rules on financial assurance requirements for the decommissioning of nuclear power
plants provide that a licensee may use a trust as the exclusive financial assurance mechanism if
the licensee recovers estimated total decommissioning costs through cost-of-service rates or
through a “non-bypassable charge.” The “non-bypassable systems benefits” charge is the charge that
the ACC has approved for APS’ recovery of certain types of costs, including costs for low income
programs, demand side management, consumer education, environmental, renewables, etc.
“Non-bypassable” means that if a customer chooses to take energy from an “energy service provider”
other than APS, the customer will still have to pay this charge as part of the customer’s APS
electric bill.



Other mechanisms are prescribed, including prepayment, if the requirements for exclusive
reliance on an external sinking fund mechanism are not met. APS
currently relies on an external
sinking fund mechanism to meet the NRC financial assurance requirements for its interests in Palo
Verde Units 1, 2 and 3. The decommissioning costs of Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3 are currently
included in APS’ ACC jurisdictional rates. The Rules provide that decommissioning costs are
recoverable through a non-bypassable “system benefits” charge, which would allow APS to maintain
its external sinking fund mechanism. See Note 12 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information about APS’ nuclear decommissioning costs.

Palo Verde Liability and Insurance Matters

See “Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station” in Note 11 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the
Palo Verde participants, including APS, for Palo Verde.

Property Not Held in Fee or Subject to Encumbrances

Jointly-Owned Facilities

APS shares ownership of some of its generating and transmission facilities with other
companies. Pinnacle West Energy shares ownership of its Silverhawk plant. The following table

Palo Verde Leases

In 1986, APS sold about 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain common facilities in
three separate sale leaseback transactions. APS accounts for these leases as operating leases.
The leases, which have terms of 29.5 years, contain options to renew the leases for two additional
years and to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms. See Notes
9 and 20 of Notes to Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional
information regarding the Palo Verde Unit 2 sale leaseback transactions.

Transmission Access

APS’
transmission facilities consist of approximately 5,589 pole miles of overhead lines and
approximately 37 miles of underground lines, 5,457 miles of which are located within the State of
Arizona. APS’ distribution
facilities consist of approximately 12,211 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 13,727
miles of underground lines, all of which are located within the State of Arizona.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Pinnacle West’s Consolidated
Financial Statements and Arizona Public Service Company’s Financial Statements and the related
Notes that appear in Item 8 of this report.

OVERVIEW

Pinnacle West owns all of the outstanding common stock of APS. APS is a vertically-integrated
electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of
Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson
metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona. Through its marketing and trading
division, APS also generates, sells and delivers electricity to wholesale customers in the western
United States. APS has historically accounted for a substantial part of our revenues and earnings.
Customer growth in APS’ service territory is about three times the national average and remains a
fundamental driver of our revenues and earnings.

Pinnacle West Energy is our unregulated generation subsidiary. We formed Pinnacle West Energy
in 1999 as a result of the ACC’s requirement that APS transfer all of its competitive assets and
services to an affiliate or to a third party by the end of 2002. We planned to transfer APS’
generation assets to Pinnacle West Energy. Additionally, Pinnacle West Energy constructed several
power plants to meet growing energy needs (1790 MW in Arizona and 570 MW in Nevada). In September
2002, the ACC issued the Track A Order, which prohibited APS from transferring its generation
assets to Pinnacle West Energy. As a result of the Track A Order, APS, through its general rate
case currently pending before the ACC, is seeking to transfer the plants built by Pinnacle West
Energy in Arizona to APS to unite the Arizona generation under one common owner, as originally
intended. We refer to these plants as the PWEC Dedicated Assets.

SunCor, our real estate development subsidiary, has been and is expected to be an important
source of earnings and cash flow, particularly during the years 2003 through 2005 due to
accelerated asset sales activity.

Our subsidiary, APS Energy Services, provides competitive commodity-related energy services
and energy-related products and services to commercial and industrial retail customers in the
western United States.

El Dorado, our investment subsidiary, sold its investment in NAC on November 18, 2004, which
resulted in a pretax gain of $4 million and the classification of NAC as discontinued operations in
2004. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2004 includes a $35 million gain ($21 million after
tax) related to the sale of El Dorado’s limited partnership interest in the Phoenix Suns.

We continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity generation and
delivery activities. In the generation area, 2004 represented the thirteenth consecutive year Palo
Verde was the largest power producer in the United States. In the delivery area, we focus on
superior reliability and customer satisfaction while expanding our transmission and distribution
system to



meet growth and sustain
reliability. We plan to expand long-term resources to meet our retail
customers’ growing electricity needs.

We believe APS’ general rate case pending before the ACC is the key issue affecting our
outlook. As discussed in greater detail in Note 3, on August 18, 2004, a substantial majority of
the parties to the rate case, including APS, the ACC staff, the Arizona Residential Utility
Consumer Office, other customer and advocacy groups, and merchant power plant intervenors entered
into the 2004 Settlement Agreement, which proposes terms under which the rate case would be
settled. Neither Pinnacle West nor APS is able to predict whether the ACC will approve the 2004
Settlement Agreement as proposed.

Other factors affecting our past and future financial results include customer growth;
purchased power and fuel costs; operations and maintenance expenses, including those relating to
plant and transmission outages; weather variations; depreciation and amortization expenses, which
are affected by net additions to utility plant and other property and changes in regulatory asset
amortization; and the performance of our subsidiaries.

EARNINGS CONTRIBUTIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENTS

We have three principal business segments (determined by services and the regulatory
environment):

•

our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail
and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electric service to Native Load
customers) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission and
distribution;

•

our marketing and trading segment, which consists of our competitive energy business
activities, including wholesale marketing and trading and APS Energy Services’
commodity-related energy services; and

•

our real estate segment, which consists of SunCor’s real estate development and
investment activities.

PINNACLE WEST CONSOLIDATED – RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we refer to “gross
margin.” With respect to our regulated electricity segment and our marketing and trading segment,
gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less purchased
power and fuel costs. “Gross margin” is a “non-GAAP
financial measure,” as defined in accordance with SEC rules. “Operating margin” (a GAAP financial measure) plus
“other operating expenses,” as disclosed in Note 17, is
equal to gross margin. We view gross margin as an important performance measure
of the core profitability of our operations. This measure is a key component of our internal
financial reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business segments. We believe
that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses.
In addition, we have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to our current period
presentation.

2004 Compared with 2003

Our consolidated net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 was $243 million
compared with $241 million for the prior-year period. The $2 million increase in the
period-to-period comparison reflected the following changes in earnings by segment:

•

Regulated Electricity Segment – Net income decreased approximately $19 million
primarily due to higher costs (primarily interest expense, depreciation, operation and
maintenance costs and property taxes, net of gross margin contributions) related to a
new power plant placed in service in mid-2003; increased operations and maintenance
costs primarily related to customer service and personnel costs; lower income tax
credits; higher depreciation related to delivery and other assets; the effects of
milder weather on retail sales; and a retail electricity rate decrease in mid-2003.
These negative factors were partially offset by lower regulatory asset amortization,
and higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth and usage.



•

Marketing and Trading Segment – Net income increased approximately $9 million
primarily due to higher forward and realized prices for wholesale electricity partially
offset by lower margins in California by APS Energy Services and increased costs
related to a new power plant placed in service in mid-2004.

•

Real Estate Segment – Net income decreased approximately $11 million primarily due
to the 2003 gain on the sale of SunCor’s water utility company, which was reported as
discontinued operations (see Note 22), and decreased asset sales partially offset by
increased land sales.

•

Other Segment – Net income increased approximately $23 million primarily due to a
$21 million after-tax gain related to the sale of El Dorado’s limited partnership
interest in the Phoenix Suns.



Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) income from continuing
operations and net income are contained in the following table (dollars in millions).

The increase in net costs (primarily interest expense, depreciation and operations and

service in mid-2003 and mid-2004 by Pinnacle West Energy totaled approximately $26 million after
income taxes in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared with the prior-year period.



Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues

Regulated electricity segment revenues were $57 million higher for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2004 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of:

•

a $101 million increase in retail revenues related to customer growth
and higher average usage, excluding weather effects;

•

a $42 million decrease in retail revenues related to milder weather;

•

a $13 million decrease in retail revenues related to a reduction in
retail electricity prices; and

•

an $11 million increase due to miscellaneous factors.

Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues

Marketing and trading segment revenues were $70 million higher for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2004 compared with the prior-year period primarily as a result of:

•

a $47 million increase from generation sales other than Native Load
primarily due to higher wholesale market prices and higher sales volumes, including
sales from the new power plants in service;

•

$28 million in higher mark-to-market gains for future-period deliveries
primarily as a result of higher forward prices for wholesale electricity;

•

$20 million of higher energy trading revenues on realized sales of
electricity primarily due to higher electricity prices; and

•

a $25 million decrease from lower competitive retail sales volumes in
California by APS Energy Services.

Other Revenues

Other revenues were $15 million higher for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared
with the prior-year period primarily due to higher non-commodity revenues at APS Energy Services.

2003 Compared with 2002

Our consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $241 million compared
with $149 million for the prior year. The 2003 net income included $15 million of after-tax income
from discontinued operations related to NAC and SunCor. The 2002 net income included a $21
million after-tax loss from discontinued operations related to NAC and SunCor (see Note 22). The
2002 net income also included a $66 million after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting for trading activities due to the adoption of EITF 02-3, “Issues Involved in
Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy
Trading and Risk Management Activities” (see Note 18). Excluding the discontinued operations and



the accounting change, the $11 million decrease in the period-to-period comparison reflects
the following changes in earnings by segment:

•

Regulated Electricity Segment – Income from continuing operations was flat when
comparing the two years, due to offsetting factors. Net income in 2003 was negatively
impacted by higher purchased power and fuel costs resulting from higher prices for
hedged gas and purchased power; higher costs related to new power plants, net of
purchased power savings; higher replacement power costs from plant outages due to
higher market prices and more unplanned outages (Cholla Unit 3 experienced an unplanned
outage from August 3, 2003 through November, 2003 and Units 1 and 2 of the Redhawk
Power Plant were substantially restricted for almost one-half of the fourth quarter to
correct an equipment design defect); higher operations and maintenance costs related to
increased pension and other benefits; two retail electricity price reductions; and
higher depreciation expense related to increased delivery and other assets. These
negative factors were offset by higher retail sales primarily due to customer growth
and favorable weather; the absence of the 2002 write-off of Redhawk Units 3 and 4;
lower operating costs primarily related to severance costs recorded in 2002; lower
regulatory asset amortization; tax credits and favorable income tax adjustments related
to prior years resolved in 2003; and higher income related to APS’ return to the AFUDC
method of capitalizing construction finance costs.

•

Marketing and Trading Segment – Income from continuing operations decreased
approximately $49 million primarily due to lower market liquidity and deteriorating
counterparty credit in the wholesale power markets in the western United States.

•

Real Estate Segment – Income from continuing operations improved approximately $35
million primarily due to increased asset, land and home sales.

•

Other Segment – Income from continuing operations increased approximately $3 million
primarily due to El Dorado Investment losses recognized in 2002.

operations and net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with the prior year are

The increase in operating and interest costs related to new power plants placed in
service by Pinnacle West Energy, net of purchased power savings and increased gross margin from
generation sales other than Native Load, totaled approximately $30 million after income taxes in
the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with the prior-year period.

Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues

Regulated electricity segment revenues were $88 million higher in the year ended December 31,
2003 compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of:

•

an $85 million increase in retail revenues related to customer growth
and higher average usage, excluding weather effects;

•

a $21 million increase in retail revenues related to weather;

•

a $6 million increase related to traditional wholesale sales as a result
of higher prices and higher sales volumes;

•

a $27 million decrease in retail revenues related to two reductions in
retail electricity prices; and

•

a $3 million net increase due to miscellaneous factors.

Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues

Marketing and trading segment revenues were $105 million higher in the year ended December 31,
2003 compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of:

•

$74 million of higher revenues related to the adoption of EITF 02-3 in
the fourth quarter of 2002, primarily due to structured contracts that were reported
gross in the current period and net in most of the prior period;

•

a $69 million increase from higher competitive retail sales in
California by APS Energy Services;

•

a $38 million increase from generation sales other than Native Load
primarily due to higher prices and sales volumes, including sales from new power plants
in service;

•

$59 million in lower mark-to-market gains for future-period deliveries
primarily as a result of lower market liquidity and lower price volatility; and

•

$17 million of lower realized wholesale revenues primarily due to lower
unit margins on trading activities that are reported on a net basis.



Real Estate Segment Revenues

Real estate segment revenues were $161 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2003
compared with the prior year primarily as a result of increased asset, land and home sales related
to SunCor’s effort to accelerate asset sales.

(a)

As discussed in Note 3 under “APS General Rate Case; 2004 Settlement Agreement,” as part of
its general rate case, APS has requested rate base treatment of the PWEC Dedicated Assets.
The estimated capital expenditures related to the PWEC Dedicated Assets are reflected in APS
for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007.

(b)

The estimate for 2005 includes about $190 million for acquisition of the Sundance Plant. See
“Request for Proposals and Asset Purchase Agreement” in Note 3 for a discussion of the asset
purchase agreement between APS and PPL Sundance.

(c)

Primarily information systems and facilities projects.

(d)

Consists primarily of capital expenditures for land development and retail and office
building construction reflected in “Real estate investments” on the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows.

Delivery capital expenditures are comprised of T&D infrastructure additions and upgrades,
capital replacements, new customer construction and related information systems and facility costs.
Examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include T&D lines and substations, line
extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to customer information
systems. Major transmission projects are driven by strong regional customer growth.



Generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to APS’ existing fossil
and nuclear plants, the acquisition of the Sundance Plant and the replacement of Palo Verde steam
generators (see below). Examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions,
upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines, boilers and
environmental equipment. Generation also includes nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately $30
million annually for 2005 to 2007.

Replacement of the steam generators in Palo Verde Unit 2 was completed during the fall outage
of 2003 at a cost to APS of approximately $70 million. The Palo Verde owners have approved the
manufacture of two additional sets of steam generators. These generators will be installed in Unit
1 (scheduled completion in the fall of 2005) and Unit 3 (scheduled completion in the fall of 2007).
Our portion of steam generator expenditures for Units 1 and 3 is approximately $140 million, which
will be spent through 2008. In 2005 through 2007, approximately $95 million of the costs for steam
generator replacements at Units 1 and 3 are included in the generation capital expenditures table
above and will be funded with internally-generated cash or external financings.

(e)

These contractual obligations include commitments for capital expenditures and other
obligations. Obligations for 2005 include about $190 million for acquisition of the Sundance
Plant (see Note 3).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate VIE lessors in order to sell and
lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2. The leases are accounted for as operating leases in
accordance with GAAP. See Note 9 for further information about the sale leaseback transactions.
We are not the primary beneficiary of the Palo Verde VIEs and, accordingly, do not consolidate
them.

APS is exposed to losses under the Palo Verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of
certain events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur. Under certain
circumstances (for example, the NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde
or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to assume the debt associated
with the transactions, make specified payments to the equity participants, and take title to the
leased Unit 2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written down in value. If
such an event had occurred as of December 31, 2004, APS would have been required to assume
approximately $250 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately $192 million.

In the first quarter of 2004, we adopted FIN No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” for all non-SPE contractual arrangements. SunCor has certain land development
arrangements that are required to be consolidated under FIN No. 46R. The assets and non-controlling
interests reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these arrangements were
approximately $34 million at December 31, 2004.

Guarantees and Letters of Credit

We and certain of our subsidiaries have issued guarantees and letters of credit in support of
our unregulated businesses. We have also obtained surety bonds on behalf of APS Energy Services. We have not
recorded any liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with
respect to these obligations. We generally provide indemnifications related to liabilities arising from or related to certain of
our agreements, with limited exceptions depending on the particular agreement. See
Note 21 for additional information regarding guarantees and letters of credit.

Credit Ratings

The
ratings of securities of Pinnacle West and APS as of March 15, 2005 are shown below and
are considered to be “investment-grade” ratings. The ratings reflect the respective views of the
rating agencies, from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained.
There is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings
may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in their respective judgments,
circumstances so warrant. Any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market
price of Pinnacle West’s or APS’ securities and serve to increase those companies’ cost of and
access



to capital. It may also require additional collateral related to certain derivative instruments
(see Note 18).

Debt Provisions

Pinnacle West’s and APS’ debt covenants related to their respective bank financing
arrangements include a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio and an interest coverage test. Pinnacle
West and APS comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet these and
other significant covenant requirements. These covenants require that the ratio of debt to total
capitalization cannot exceed 65% for the Company and for APS. At December 31, 2004, the ratio was
approximately 53% for Pinnacle West and 54% for APS. The provisions regarding interest coverage
require a minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for each of the Company and
APS. Based on 2004 results, the coverages were approximately 4 times for the Company and 4 times
for APS. Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which,
generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants.

Neither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’ financing agreements contain “ratings triggers” that would
result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings
downgrade. However, in the event of a ratings downgrade, Pinnacle West and/or APS may be subject
to increased interest costs under certain financing agreements.

All of Pinnacle West’s bank agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in
defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or
APS were to default under other agreements. All of APS’ bank agreements contain cross-default
provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank
agreements if APS were to default under other agreements. Pinnacle West’s and APS’ credit
agreements generally contain provisions under which the lenders could refuse to advance loans in
the event of a material adverse change in financial condition or financial prospects, except that
Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings
equal to outstanding commercial paper amounts.



See Note 6 for further discussions.

Capital Needs and Resources — By Company

Pinnacle West (Parent Company)

Our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders; interest payments and optional
and mandatory repayments of principal on our long-term debt (see the table above for our
contractual requirements, including our debt repayment obligations, but excluding optional
repayments). On October 20, 2004, our Board of Directors increased the common stock dividend to an
indicated annual rate of $1.90 per share from $1.80 per share, effective with the December 1, 2004
dividend payment. The level of our common dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent
on a number of factors including, but not limited to, payout ratio trends, free cash flow and
financial market conditions.

Our primary sources of cash are dividends from APS, external financings and cash distributions
from our other subsidiaries, primarily SunCor. For the years 2002 through 2004, total dividends
from APS were $510 million and total cash distributions from SunCor were $206 million. For the
year ended December 31, 2004, dividends from APS were approximately $170 million and distributions
from SunCor were approximately $85 million. We expect SunCor to make cash distributions to the
parent company of approximately $80 to $100 million in 2005 based on anticipated asset sales
activities. As discussed in Note 3 under “ACC Financing Orders,” APS must maintain a common equity
ratio of at least 40% and may not pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common
equity below that threshold. As defined in the Financing Order, common equity ratio is common
equity divided by common equity plus long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term
debt. At December 31, 2004, APS’ common equity ratio as defined was approximately 45%.

On February 2, 2004, we used proceeds from the $165 million Floating Rate Notes issued on
November 12, 2003 and short-term borrowings to pay down the maturing $215 million 4.5% Senior Notes
due 2004.

At December 31, 2004, the parent company’s outstanding long-term debt, including current
maturities, was $468 million. In October 2004, we replaced two separate revolving credit
facilities (with collective borrowing capacity of $275 million) with a $300 million revolving
credit facility that terminates in October 2007. This line of credit is available to support the
issuance of up to $250 million in commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings, including up
to $100 million for issuances of letters of credit. At December 31, 2004, we had no commercial
paper or short-term borrowings outstanding. We ended 2004 in an invested position.

Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified pension plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and our
subsidiaries. We contribute at least the minimum amount required under IRS regulations, but no
more than the maximum tax-deductible amount. The minimum required funding takes into consideration
the value of the fund assets and our pension obligation. We contributed $35 million in 2004, $46
million in 2003, $27 million in 2002, $44 million in 2001 and $24 million in 2000. APS and other
subsidiaries fund their share of the pension contribution, of which APS represents approximately
92% of the total funding amounts described above. The assets in the plan are comprised of common
stocks, bonds and real estate. Future year contribution amounts are dependent



on fund performance and fund valuation assumptions. The minimum required contribution to be made
to our pension plan in 2005 is estimated to be approximately $50 million. The expected
contribution to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2005 is estimated to be approximately $40
million.

APS

APS’ capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and optional and mandatory
redemptions of long-term debt. See “ACC Financing Order” in Note 3 for a discussion of the $500
million financing arrangement between APS and Pinnacle West Energy authorized by the ACC pursuant
to the Financing Order.

APS pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations and, to the extent necessary,
external financings. APS has historically paid for its dividends to Pinnacle West with cash from
operations. See “Pinnacle West (Parent Company)” above for a discussion of the common equity ratio
that APS must maintain in order to pay dividends to Pinnacle West.

On February 15, 2004, $125 million of APS’ 5.875% notes due 2004 were redeemed at maturity and
on March 1, 2004, $80 million of APS’ First Mortgage Bonds, 6.625% Series due 2004 were redeemed at
maturity. APS used cash from operations and short-term debt to redeem the maturing debt.

On March 31, 2004, Navajo County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation issued $166 million of
variable interest rate pollution control bonds, 2004 Series A-E, due 2034. The bonds were issued
to refinance $166 million of outstanding pollution control bonds. The refinanced bonds were all
$25 million of the Navajo 5.50% bonds due 2028 and $141 million of the Navajo 5.875% bonds due
2028. The Series A-E bonds are payable solely from revenues obtained from APS pursuant to a loan
agreement between APS and Navajo County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation. These bonds are
classified as long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 6.

Also on March 31, 2004, Coconino County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation issued $13
million of variable interest rate pollution control bonds, 2004 Series A, due 2034. The bonds were
issued to refinance $13 million of outstanding pollution control bonds. The refinanced bonds were
$13 million of the Coconino 5.875% bonds due 2028. The Series A bonds are payable solely from
revenues obtained from APS pursuant to a loan agreement between APS and Coconino County, Arizona
Pollution Control Corporation. These bonds are classified as long-term debt on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. See Note 6.

In May 2004, APS renewed its $250 million revolving credit facility, while increasing its size
to $325 million and extending its term to three years. The revolver provides liquidity support for
APS’ $250 million commercial paper program, as well as an additional $75 million for other
liquidity needs and miscellaneous letters of credit.

On June 29, 2004, APS issued $300 million of 5.80% senior unsecured notes due June 30, 2014.
The proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to redeem $100 million in aggregate principal
amount of APS’ 6.25% Notes due January 15, 2005 and a portion of $300 million in aggregate
principal amount of APS’ 7.625% Notes due August 1, 2005.



On March 1, 2005, Maricopa County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation issued $164 million
of variable interest rate pollution control bonds, 2004 Series A-E, due 2029. The bonds were
issued to refinance $164 million of outstanding pollution control bonds. The Series A-E bonds are
payable solely from revenues obtained from APS pursuant to a loan agreement between APS and
Maricopa County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation. These bonds are classified as long-term
debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

APS has retired all first mortgage bonds issued by APS under its 1946 mortgage and deed of
trust, including the first mortgage bonds securing APS senior notes. On April 30, 2004, APS
terminated its mortgage and deed of trust and, as a result, is not able to issue any additional
first mortgage bonds under that mortgage.

APS’ outstanding debt was approximately $2.7 billion at December 31, 2004. APS had committed
lines of credit with various banks of $325 million at December 31, 2004 which were available either
to support the issuance of commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings, including issuances
of letters of credit. At December 31, 2004, APS had no outstanding commercial paper or bank
borrowings. APS ended 2004 in an invested position.

Although provisions in APS’ articles of incorporation and ACC financing orders establish
maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that APS may issue, APS does not expect any of these
provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements.

Pinnacle West Energy

Pinnacle West Energy’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures. In May
2004, SNWA paid Pinnacle West Energy approximately $91 million for a 25% interest in the 570 MW
Silverhawk combined cycle plant. See the capital expenditures table above for actual capital
expenditures for 2004 and projected capital expenditures for the next three years. Pinnacle West
Energy’s sources of cash will be cash infusions from the parent and cash from operations.

See “ACC Financing Order” in Note 3 for a discussion of the $500 million financing arrangement
between APS and Pinnacle West Energy authorized by the ACC pursuant to the Financing Order.

Other Subsidiaries

During the past three years, SunCor funded its cash requirements with cash from operations and
its own external financings. SunCor’s capital needs consist primarily of capital expenditures for
land development and retail and office building construction. See the capital expenditures table
above for actual capital expenditures in 2004 and projected capital expenditures for the next three
years. SunCor expects to fund its capital requirements with cash from operations and external
financings.

In 2004, SunCor did not issue any long-term debt; and it redeemed, refinanced or repaid $2
million in long-term debt (see Note 6).

SunCor’s total outstanding debt was approximately $87 million as of December 31, 2004.
SunCor’s total short-term debt was $71 million at December 31, 2004, including $35 million of



short-term borrowings outstanding under a $90 million line of credit. SunCor’s long-term
debt, including current maturities, totaled $16 million at December 31, 2004.

We expect SunCor to make cash distributions to the parent company of approximately $80 to $100
million in 2005 based on anticipated asset sales activities.

El Dorado funded its cash requirements during the past three years, primarily for NAC in 2002,
with cash infused by the parent company and with cash from operations. As described above, during
2004, El Dorado sold its limited partnership interest in the Phoenix Suns and its ownership
interest in NAC. El Dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and
intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments.

APS Energy Services’ cash requirements during the past three years were funded with cash
infusions from the parent company and with cash from operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management must often make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting
period. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ
from those estimates. We consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical
because of the uncertainties, judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and
operations involved.

Regulatory Accounting

Regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators, such as the ACC and the FERC, to
be reflected in our financial statements. Their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that
would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies. If
future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in
current period earnings. We had $135 million of regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets at December 31, 2004. A component of the 2004 Settlement Agreement, which is subject to ACC
approval, would allow APS to acquire the PWEC Dedicated Assets from Pinnacle West Energy, with a
net carrying value of approximately $850 million, and rate base the PWEC Dedicated Assets at a rate
base value of $700 million. This would result in a mandatory rate base disallowance of
approximately $150 million. As a result, for financial reporting purposes, APS would recognize a
one-time, after-tax net plant write-off of approximately $90 million in the period when the plant
transfer to APS is completed and would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $5
million. See Notes 1 and 3 for more information about regulatory assets, APS’ general rate case
and the 2004 Settlement Agreement.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting

Changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement
benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position.
The most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and
net periodic cost, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate



earnings on invested funds over the long-term, and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates. We
review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.

The following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions
would have had on the 2004 projected benefit obligation, our 2004 reported pension liability on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and our 2004 reported pension expense, after consideration of amounts
capitalized or billed to electric plant participants, on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of

See Note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Derivative Accounting

Derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying
interpretations. Our evaluation of these rules, as they apply to our contracts, will determine
whether we use accrual accounting (for contracts designated as normal) or fair value
(mark-to-market) accounting. Mark-to-market accounting requires that changes in the fair value are
recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met. For fair value hedges,
the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item
associated with the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, changes in the
fair value of the derivative are recognized in common stock equity (as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss)).

The
fair value of our derivative contracts is not always readily
determinable. In some cases, we use models and other valuation
techniques to determine fair value. The use of these models and
valuation techniques sometimes requires subjective and complex
judgement. Actual results could differ from the results estimated
through application of these methods. Our marketing and trading
portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a portfolio
of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales
transactions. See “Market Risks – Commodity Price
Risk” below for quantitative analysis. See Note 1 for
discussion on accounting policies and Note 18 for a further
discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting.

OTHER ACCOUNTING MATTERS

Accounting for Derivative and Trading Activities

We adopted EITF 02-3 in the fourth quarter of 2002. We recorded a $66 million after-tax
charge in net income as a cumulative effect adjustment for the previously recorded accumulated
unrealized mark-to-market on energy trading contracts that did not meet the accounting definition
of a derivative. Our energy trading contracts that are derivatives are accounted for at fair value
under SFAS No. 133. Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative are now accounted
for on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the contracted
commodities are delivered or received.

See Notes 1 and 18 for further information on accounting for derivatives.

Variable Interest Entities

See “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” and Note 20 for
a discussion of VIEs.

PINNACLE WEST CONSOLIDATED – FACTORS AFFECTING OUR FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

APS General Rate Case

We believe APS’ general rate case, including the proposed settlement pending before the ACC is
the key issue affecting our outlook. See “APS General Rate Case; 2004 Settlement Agreement” in
Note 3 for a detailed discussion of this rate case and proposed settlement.

Factors Affecting Operating Revenues, Purchased Power and Fuel Costs

General

Electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail
markets in Arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale power markets in the western United
States. These revenues are affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer mix, customer
growth and average usage per customer as well as electricity prices and variations in weather from



period to period. Competitive sales of energy and energy-related products and services are made by
APS Energy Services in western states that have opened to competition.

Customer and Sales Growth

The customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph applies
to Native Load customers and sales to them. Customer growth in APS’ service territory averaged
about 3.4% a year for the three years 2002 through 2004; we currently expect customer growth to
average about 3.8% per year from 2005 to 2007. We currently estimate that total retail electricity
sales in kilowatt-hours will grow 5.0% on average, from 2005 through 2007, before the effects of
weather variations. Customer growth for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with the prior
year was 3.7%.

Actual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from our projections as
a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth and usage patterns. Our
experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatt-hour sales projection
attributable to such economic factors can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of
up to $10 million.

Retail Rate Changes

APS has a rate settlement agreement pending before the ACC that includes,
among other things, a proposed general rate increase of 4.21% and a power supply adjuster that
would provide timely recovery of variations in purchased power and fuel prices. See “APS General
Rate Case; 2004 Settlement Agreement” in Note 3. APS expects to
file another general rate case in late 2005.

Weather

In forecasting retail sales growth, we assume normal weather patterns
based on historical data. Historical extreme weather variations have resulted in
annual variations in net income in excess of $20 million. However, our experience indicates that
the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual
net income of up to $10 million.

Trading

In accordance with GAAP, we adopted EITF 02-3,
“Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts
Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities,” in
the fourth quarter of 2002. As a
consequence, we are recording structured trading transactions completed prior to implementation of
EITF 02-3 that do not qualify as derivatives for financial accounting purposes on the accrual
method, recognizing the revenues and associated purchased power and fuel costs as the respective
commodities are delivered. We expect the deliveries under these historical contracts to contribute
the following amounts to net income: approximately $12 million each year in 2005 through 2007 and
approximately $7 million in 2008.

Purchased Power and Fuel Costs

Purchased power and fuel costs are impacted by our electricity
sales volumes, existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel, our power plant
performance, transmission availability or constraints, prevailing market prices, new generating
plants being placed in service and our hedging program for managing such costs. See “Natural Gas
Supply” in Note 11 for more information on fuel costs. See “APS General Rate Case; 2004 Settlement
Agreement” in Note 3 for information regarding a power supply adjuster.

Wholesale Power Market Conditions

The marketing and trading division focuses primarily on
managing APS’ purchased power and fuel risks in connection with its costs of serving retail
customer demand. We moved this division to APS in early 2003 for future marketing and trading
activities (existing wholesale contracts remained at Pinnacle West) as a result of the ACC’s



Track A Order prohibiting APS’ transfer of generating assets to Pinnacle West Energy.
Additionally, the marketing and trading division, subject to specified parameters, markets, hedges
and trades in electricity, fuels and emission allowances and credits. Our future earnings will be
affected by the strength or weakness of the wholesale power market. The market has suffered a
substantial reduction in overall liquidity because there are fewer creditworthy counterparties and
because several key participants have exited the market or scaled back their activities.

Other Factors Affecting Financial Results

Operations and Maintenance Expenses

Operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by
growth, power plant additions and operations, inflation, outages, higher trending pension and other
postretirement benefit costs and other factors.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses

Depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by
net additions to utility plant and other property, which includes generation construction or
acquisition, and changes in regulatory asset amortization. Silverhawk was placed in service in May
2004. APS plans to acquire the Sundance Plant in 2005 and, in accordance with the proposed rate
settlement, to issue requests for proposals to acquire additional long-term resources in 2006 and
2007. As part of the 1999 Settlement Agreement, APS amortized certain regulatory assets over a
period that ended June 30, 2004. Amortization in the last three years is as follows (dollars in
millions):




$115

$86

$18

Property Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes, which are
affected by tax rates and the value of property in-service and under construction. The average
property tax rate for APS, which currently owns the majority of our property, was 9.2% of assessed
value for 2004 and 9.3% for 2003. We expect property taxes to increase primarily due to our
generation construction program, as the plants phase-in to the
property tax base, the planned acquisition of the Sundance Plant and our additions to existing facilities.

Interest Expense

Interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the
interest rates on that debt. The primary factors affecting borrowing levels in the next several
years are expected to be our capital requirements and our internally generated cash flow.
Capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under
construction. We stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial
operation. As noted above, we placed new power plants in commercial operation in 2001, 2002, 2003
and 2004. Interest expense is also affected by interest rates on variable-rate debt and interest
rates on the refinancing of the Company’s future liquidity needs. In addition, see Note 1 for a
discussion of AFUDC.

Retail Competition

The regulatory developments and legal challenges to the Rules discussed in
Note 3 have raised considerable uncertainty about the status and pace of retail electric
competition and of electric restructuring in Arizona. Although some very limited retail
competition existed in APS’ service area in 1999 and 2000, there are currently no active retail
competitors providing unbundled energy or other utility services to APS’ customers. As a result,
we cannot predict when, and the extent to which, additional competitors will re-enter APS’ service
territory.



Subsidiaries

In the case of SunCor, efforts to accelerate asset sales activities in
2004 were successful. A portion of these sales have been, and additional amounts may be required
to be, reported as discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statements of Income. SunCor’s net
income was $45 million in 2004. See Note 22 for further discussion. We anticipate SunCor’s
earnings contributions in 2005 to be approximately $50 million after income taxes.

El Dorado’s historical results are not indicative of future performance. El Dorado’s income
before taxes in 2004 was $40 million. Income taxes were recorded
at the parent company. The year ended 2004 includes a $35 million gain ($21 million after tax) related to the
sale of El Dorado’s limited partnership interest in the Phoenix
Suns. El Dorado sold its investment in NAC on November 18, 2004,
which resulted in a pretax gain of $4 million and is classified
as discontinued operations in 2004 and prior years. See Note 22 for information
regarding the sale of NAC.

General

Our financial results may be affected by a number of broad factors. See
“Forward-Looking Statements” for further information on such factors, which may cause our actual
future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate.

Market Risks

Our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates, commodity
prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund.

Interest Rate and Equity Risk

Our major financial market risk exposure is to changing interest rates. Changing interest
rates will affect interest paid on variable-rate debt and interest earned by our nuclear
decommissioning trust fund (see Note 12). Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use
of a combination of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. On January 29, 2004, we entered into two
fixed-for-floating interest rate swap transactions on our $300 million 6.4% senior note. These
transactions qualify as fair value hedges under SFAS No 133. See Note 6.

The tables below present contractual balances of our consolidated long-term and short-term
debt at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair value of those instruments on December 31,
2004 and 2003. The interest rates presented in the tables below represent the weighted-average
interest rates for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in thousands):

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances. We manage risks associated with
these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives,
including exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options and swaps.
Our ERMC, consisting of officers and key management personnel, oversees company-wide energy risk
management activities and monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure
compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies. As part of our risk
management program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity, fuels and
emissions allowances and credits. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high
correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities. In addition, subject to specified risk
parameters monitored by the ERMC, we engage in marketing and trading activities intended to profit
from market price movements.

The mark-to-market value of derivative instruments related to our risk management and trading
activities are presented in two categories consistent with our business segments:

•

Regulated Electricity – non-trading derivative instruments that hedge our purchases
and sales of electricity and fuel for APS’ Native Load requirements of our regulated
electricity business segment; and

•

Marketing and Trading – non-trading and trading derivative instruments of our
competitive business segment.

The following tables show the pretax changes in mark-to-market of our non-trading and trading
derivative positions in 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions):

transactions.

(b)

These contracts are hedges of our forecasted purchases of natural gas and
electricity. The impact of these hypothetical price movements would substantially
offset the impact that these same price movements would have on the physical exposures
being hedged.

Credit Risk

We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties. We
have risk management and trading contracts with many counterparties, including two counterparties
for which a worst case exposure represents approximately 35% of Pinnacle West’s $391 million of
risk management and trading assets as of December 31, 2004. See Note 1, “Derivative
Accounting” for a discussion of our credit valuation adjustment policy. See Note 18 for further
discussion of credit risk.

ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY – RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

Throughout the following explanations of APS’ results of operations, we refer to “gross
margin.” Gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less
purchased power and fuel costs.
“Gross margin” is a “non-GAAP financial measure,” as defined in accordance with SEC rules. Operating income (a GAAP financial measure) plus specified operating expenses (operations and maintenance,
depreciation and amortization, operating income taxes and other
taxes), as disclosed on the Statements of Income, is equal to gross margin. We view gross margin as an important performance measure of the core
profitability of our operations. This measure is a key component of our internal financial
reporting and is used by our management in analyzing our business segments. We believe that
investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses. In
addition, we have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to our current period
presentation.

2004 Compared with 2003

APS’ net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $200 million compared with $181
million for the prior year. The $19 million increase in the period-to-period comparison reflects
lower regulatory asset amortization; the benefit of customer growth; decreased purchased power and
fuel costs primarily due to lower prices for capacity purchases; increased interest income and
lower replacement power costs due to fewer unplanned outages. These positive factors were
partially offset by increased operations and maintenance costs related to increased generation,
customer service and personnel costs; the effects of weather on retail sales; higher depreciation
and amortization related to increased delivery and other assets; lower realized margins on energy
trading due to higher wholesale electricity prices; a retail electricity price reduction; lower
income tax credits; and higher interest expense primarily due to increased utility plant in
service.



Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) net income for the year
ended December 31, 2004 compared with the prior year are contained in the following table (dollars
in millions).

Regulated Electricity Revenues

Regulated electricity revenues were $52 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2004
compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of:

•

an $101 million increase in retail revenues related to customer growth
and higher average usage, excluding weather effects;

•

a $42 million decrease in retail revenues related to weather;

•

a $13 million decrease in retail revenues related to a reduction in
retail electricity prices; and

•

a $6 million increase due to miscellaneous factors.

Marketing and Trading Revenues

Marketing and trading revenues were $40 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2004
compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of:



•

a $13 million decrease from generation sales other than Native Load due
to substantially lower sales volumes, resulting from lower market spark spreads;

•

$49 million of higher energy trading revenues on realized sales of
electricity primarily due to higher electricity prices; and

•

$4 million in higher mark-to-market gains for future-period deliveries
primarily as a result of higher forward prices for wholesale electricity.

2003 Compared with 2002

APS’ net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $181 million compared with $199
million for the prior year. The $18 million decrease in the period-to-period comparison reflects
higher purchased power and fuel costs resulting from higher prices for hedged gas and purchased
power; higher replacement power costs from plant outages due to higher market prices and more
unplanned outages (Cholla Unit 3 experienced an unplanned outage from August of 2003 through
November of 2003); higher operations and maintenance costs related to increased pension and other
benefits; two retail electricity price reductions; and higher depreciation expense related to
increased delivery and other assets. These negative factors were partially offset by higher retail
sales primarily due to customer growth and favorable weather; lower operating costs primarily
related to severance costs recorded in 2002; lower regulatory asset amortization; tax credits and
favorable income tax adjustments related to prior years resolved in 2003; higher income related to
APS’ return to the AFUDC method of capitalizing construction finance costs; and increased
generation sales other than Native Load primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by
lower unit margins.

•

an $85 million increase in retail revenues related to customer growth
and higher average usage, excluding weather effects;

•

a $21 million increase in retail revenues related to weather;

•

a $6 million increase related to traditional wholesale sales as a result
of higher prices and higher sales volumes;



•

a $27 million decrease in retail revenues related to two reductions in
retail electricity prices; and

•

a $12 million net increase due to miscellaneous factors.

Marketing and Trading Revenues

Marketing and trading revenues were $71 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2003
compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of:

•

a $66 million increase from generation sales other than Native Load
primarily due to higher prices and sales volumes, including sales from new power plants
in service;

•

a $5 million net increase due to miscellaneous factors.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

(PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION)

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13(a)-15(f). Management conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework,

our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
which is included herein and relates also to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

March 15, 2005



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Pinnacle West Capital Corporation

Phoenix, Arizona

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation
and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in common stock equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the Index at Item 15. We also have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule, an opinion on management’s assessment, and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to
the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment that
the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

As discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the Company changed its
method for accounting for trading activities in order to comply with the provisions of Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-3,

Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for
Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation and Nature of Operations

Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Pinnacle West and
our subsidiaries: APS, Pinnacle West Energy, APS Energy Services, SunCor and El Dorado (principally
NAC). See Note 22 for a discussion of the sale of NAC in November 2004. Significant intercompany
accounts and transactions between the consolidated companies have been eliminated.

APS is a vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale
electric service to substantially all of the state of Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson metropolitan area and Mohave county in northwestern Arizona. Through its marketing and trading division, APS also generates,
sells and delivers electricity to wholesale customers in the western United States. Pinnacle West
Energy, which was formed in 1999, is the subsidiary through which we conduct our unregulated
generation operations. APS Energy Services was formed in 1998 and provides competitive commodity
energy and energy-related products to key customers in competitive markets in the western United
States. SunCor is a developer of residential, commercial and industrial real estate projects in
Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho and Utah. El Dorado is an investment firm.

Accounting Records and Use of Estimates

Our accounting records are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. We have reclassified certain prior year amounts
to conform to the current year presentation.

Derivative Accounting

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances and in interest rates. We manage
risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various instruments that
qualify as derivatives, including exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter
forwards, options and swaps. As part of our overall risk management program, we use such
instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity, fuels, and emissions allowances and
credits. In addition, subject to specified risk parameters monitored by the ERMC, we engage in
marketing and trading activities intended to profit from market price movements.

We account for our derivative contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS
No. 149, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133 requires
that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and
measure those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are
either recognized periodically in income or, if certain hedge criteria are met, in common stock
equity (as a component of other comprehensive income (loss)). SFAS No. 133 provides a scope
exception for contracts that meet the normal purchases and sales criteria specified in the
standard.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2002, we accounted for our trading activity at fair value, with
changes in fair value reported in earnings as required by EITF 98-10, “Accounting for Contracts
Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities.” In the fourth quarter of 2002, we
adopted EITF 02-3, “Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading
Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities,” which rescinded
EITF 98-10. We recorded a $66 million after-tax charge in net income as a cumulative effect
adjustment for the previously recorded accumulated unrealized mark-to-market on energy trading
contracts that did not meet the accounting definition of a derivative. Our energy trading
contracts that are derivatives are accounted for at fair value under SFAS No. 133, as amended.
Energy trading contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative are now accounted for on
an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the contracted
commodities are delivered or received.

Under fair value (mark-to-market) accounting, derivative contracts for the purchase or sale of
energy commodities are reflected at fair market value, net of valuation adjustments, with resulting
unrealized gains and losses recorded as current or long-term assets and liabilities from risk
management and trading activities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We determine fair market value using actively-quoted prices when available. We consider
quotes for exchange-traded contracts and over-the-counter quotes obtained from independent brokers
to be actively-quoted.

When actively-quoted prices are not available, we use prices provided by other external
sources. This includes quarterly and calendar year quotes from independent brokers, which we
convert into monthly prices using historical relationships.

For options, long-term contracts and other contracts for which price quotes are not available,
we use models and other valuation methods. The valuation models we employ utilize spot prices,
forward prices, historical market data and other factors to forecast future prices. The primary
valuation technique we use to calculate the fair value of contracts where price quotes are not
available is based on the extrapolation of forward pricing curves using observable market data for
more liquid delivery points in the same region and actual transactions at the more illiquid
delivery points. We also value option contracts using a variation of the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model.

For non-exchange traded contracts, we calculate fair market value based on the average of the
bid and offer price, and we discount to reflect net present value. We maintain certain valuation
adjustments for a number of risks associated with the valuation of future commitments. These
include valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risks based on the financial condition of
counterparties. The liquidity valuation adjustment represents the cost that would be incurred if
all unmatched positions were closed-out or hedged.

The credit valuation adjustment represents estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to
counterparties, taking into account netting arrangements, expected default experience for the
credit rating of the counterparties and the overall diversification of the portfolio.
Counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of major energy companies, municipalities,
local distribution companies and financial institutions. We maintain credit policies that
management believes minimize overall credit risk. Determination of the credit quality of
counterparties is based upon a number of factors, including credit ratings, financial condition,
project economics and collateral requirements. When



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

applicable, we employ standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and
negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.

The use of models and other valuation methods to determine fair market value often requires
subjective and complex judgment. Actual results could differ from the results estimated through
application of these methods. Our marketing and trading portfolio includes structured activities
hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales
transactions. Our practice is to hedge within timeframes established by the ERMC.

See Note 18 for additional information about our derivative and energy trading accounting
policies.

Regulatory Accounting

APS is regulated by the ACC and the FERC. The accompanying financial statements reflect the
rate-making policies of these commissions. For regulated operations, we prepare our financial
statements in accordance with SFAS No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation.” SFAS No. 71 requires a cost-based, rate-regulated enterprise to reflect the impact of
regulatory decisions in its financial statements. As a result, we capitalize certain costs that
would be included as expense in the current period by unregulated companies. Regulatory assets
represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in
customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already
been collected from customers.

Management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery
by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to
other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction. This determination reflects the current
political and regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future. If future
recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current
period earnings.

As part of the 1999 Settlement Agreement, APS amortized certain regulatory assets over a
period that ended June 30, 2004. Amortization in the last three years is as follows (dollars in
millions):

Utility Plant and Depreciation

Utility plant is the term we use to describe the business property and equipment that supports
electric service, consisting primarily of generation, transmission and distribution facilities. We
report utility plant at its original cost, which includes:

We expense the costs of plant outages, major maintenance and routine maintenance as incurred.
We charge retired utility plant to accumulated depreciation. Prior to 2003, we charged removal
costs, less salvage, to accumulated depreciation. Effective January 1, 2003, we applied the
provisions of SFAS No. 143. The standard requires that liabilities associated with the retirement
of tangible long-lived assets be recognized at fair value as incurred and capitalized as part of
the related tangible long-lived assets. Accretion of the liability due to the passage of time is
an operating



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the long-lived asset.
See Note 12.

APS records a regulatory liability for the asset retirement obligations related to its
regulated assets. This regulatory liability represents the difference between the amount that has
been recovered in regulated rates and the amount calculated under SFAS No. 143. APS believes it
can recover in regulated rates the transition and ongoing current period costs calculated in
accordance with SFAS No. 143.

We record depreciation on utility plant on a straight-line basis over the remaining useful
life of the related assets. The approximate remaining average useful lives of our utility property
at December 31, 2004 were as follows:

For the years 2002 through 2004, the depreciation rates, as prescribed by our regulators,
ranged from a low of 1.51% to a high of 12.5%. The weighted-average rate was 3.36% for 2004, 3.35%
for 2003 and 3.35% for 2002. We depreciate non-utility property and equipment over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets, ranging from 3 to 55 years.

Investments

El Dorado accounts for its investments using the equity (if significant influence) and cost
(less than 20% ownership) methods. See Note 22 for a discussion of the sale of NAC.

The Company’s investments have been reviewed in accordance with EITF 03-1, “The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,” and no
other-than-temporary impairments were identified.

Capitalized Interest

Capitalized interest represents the cost of debt funds used to finance non-regulated
construction projects. Plant construction costs, including capitalized interest, are expensed
through depreciation when completed projects are placed into commercial operation. The rate used
to calculate capitalized interest was a composite rate of 4.44% for 2004, 4.55% for 2003 and 4.80%
for 2002. Capitalized interest ceases to accrue when construction is complete.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

AFUDC represents the approximate net composite interest cost of borrowed funds and a
reasonable return on the equity funds used for construction of regulated utility plant. Plant
construction costs, including AFUDC, are recovered in authorized rates through depreciation when
completed projects are placed into commercial operation.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AFUDC was calculated by using a composite rate of 8.42% for 2004 and 8.55% for 2003. APS
compounds AFUDC monthly and ceases to accrue AFUDC when construction work is completed and the
property is placed in service.

In 2003, APS returned to the AFUDC method of capitalizing interest and equity costs associated
with construction projects in a regulated utility. This is consistent with APS returning to a
vertically-integrated utility, as evidenced by APS’ 2003 general rate case filing, which includes
the request for rate recognition of generation assets. Prior to 2003, APS capitalized interest in
accordance with SFAS No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest Cost.” Although AFUDC both increases the
plant balance and results in higher current earnings during the construction period, AFUDC is
realized in future revenues through depreciation provisions included in rates. This change
increased earnings by $11 million in 2003 as compared to what it would have been under SFAS No. 34.

Electric Revenues

We derive electric revenues from sales of electricity to our regulated Native Load customers
and sales to other parties from our marketing and trading activities. Revenues related to the sale
of electricity are generally recorded when service is rendered or electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination and billing of electricity sales to individual Native Load
customers is based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout
the month. At the end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers since the date
of the last meter reading and billing and the corresponding unbilled revenue are estimated. We
exclude sales taxes on electric revenues from both revenue and taxes other than income taxes.

Revenues from our Native Load customers and non-derivative instruments are reported on a gross
basis on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income. In the electricity business, some
contracts to purchase energy are netted against other contracts to sell energy. This is called
“book-out” and usually occurs in contracts that have the same terms (quantities and delivery
points) and for which power does not flow. We net these book-outs, which reduces both revenues and
purchased power and fuel costs.

All gains and losses (realized and unrealized) on energy trading contracts that qualify as
derivatives are included in marketing and trading segment revenues on the Consolidated Statements
of Income on a net basis.

Real Estate Revenues

SunCor recognizes revenue from land, home and qualifying commercial operating assets sales in
full, provided (a) the income is determinable, that is, the collectibility of the sales price is
reasonably assured or the amount that will not be collectible can be estimated, and (b) the
earnings process is virtually complete, that is, SunCor is not obligated to perform significant
activities after the sale to earn the income. Unless both conditions exist, recognition of all or
part of the income is postponed under the percentage of completion
method per SFAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real
Estate.” SunCor recognizes income only after the assets’ title has passed.
A single method of recognizing income is applied to all sales transactions within an entire home,
land or commercial development project. Commercial property and management revenues are recorded
over the term of the lease or period in which services are provided. In addition, see Note 22 –
Discontinued Operations.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Real Estate Investments

Real estate investments primarily include SunCor’s land, home inventory and investments in
joint ventures. Land includes acquisition costs, infrastructure costs, property taxes and
capitalized interest directly associated with the acquisition and development of each project.
Land under development and land held for future development are stated at accumulated cost, except
that, to the extent that such land is believed to be impaired, it is written down to fair value.
Land held for sale is stated at the lower of accumulated cost or estimated fair value less costs to
sell. Home inventory consists of construction costs, improved lot costs, capitalized interest and
property taxes on homes under construction. Home inventory is stated at the lower of accumulated
cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell. Investments in joint ventures for which SunCor
does not have a controlling financial interest are not consolidated but are accounted for using the
equity method of accounting. In 2003, SunCor acquired two joint ventures for $10 million and
consolidated $53 million of assets and $43 million of liabilities, which are included on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2003. The $10 million cash investment is included on
the other investing line of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow at December 31, 2003. In
addition, see Note 22 – Discontinued Operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents.

We have investments in auction rate securities in which interest rates are reset on a
short-term basis; however, the underlying contract maturity dates extend beyond three months. We classify the investments in auction rate securities as investments
in debt securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We
have reclassified cash at December 31, 2003 of $92 million to investment in debt securities.
Included in that reclassification is $70 million related to APS.
The purchase and sale activities
related to these investments have also been reclassified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows.

Nuclear Fuel

APS charges nuclear fuel to fuel expense by using the unit-of-production method. The
unit-of-production method is an amortization method based on actual physical usage. APS divides
the cost of the fuel by the estimated number of thermal units it expects to produce with that fuel.
APS then multiplies that rate by the number of thermal units produced within the current period.
This calculation determines the current period nuclear fuel expense.

APS also charges nuclear fuel expense for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The
DOE is responsible for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and it charges APS $0.001 per
kWh of nuclear generation. See Note 11 for information about spent nuclear fuel disposal and Note
12 for information on nuclear decommissioning costs.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability approach prescribed by SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” We file our federal income tax return on a consolidated basis and
we file our state income tax returns on a consolidated or unitary basis. In accordance with our
intercompany tax sharing agreement, federal and state income taxes are allocated to each subsidiary



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

as though each subsidiary filed a separate income tax return. Any difference between that
method and the consolidated (and unitary) income tax liability is attributed to the parent company.
See Note 4.

Reacquired Debt Costs

For reacquired debt costs related to the regulated portion of APS’ business, APS defers those
gains and losses incurred upon early retirement and is seeking recovery of the net amount of losses
in the APS general rate case (see Note 3).

Stock-Based Compensation

In 2002, we began applying the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation,
as provided for in SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” The fair value method
of accounting is the preferred method. In accordance with the transition requirements of SFAS No.
123, we applied the fair value method prospectively, beginning with 2002 stock grants. In prior
years, we recognized stock compensation expense based on the intrinsic value method allowed in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”

The following chart compares our net income, stock compensation expense and earnings per share
to what those items would have been if we had recorded stock compensation expense based on the fair
value method for all stock grants through 2004 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

Intangible Assets

We have no goodwill recorded and have separately disclosed other intangible assets on Pinnacle
West’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” The intangible assets are amortized over their finite
useful lives. Amortization expense was $34 million in 2004, $25 million in 2003, and $21 million in 2002. Estimated amortization expense on
existing intangible assets over the next five years is $33 million in 2005, $31 million in 2006,
$25 million in 2007, $16 million in 2008, and $1 million in 2009. At December 31, 2004, the
weighted average amortization period for intangible assets is 7 years.

2. New Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment.” The standard
establishes accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for
goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in
exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments
or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. SFAS No. 123R is effective as
of the beginning of the first interim or annual period that begins after June 15, 2005. We are
currently accounting for stock-based compensation using the fair value method and are evaluating
the impacts of this new guidance, but we do not believe it will have a material impact on our
financial statements.

See the following Notes for information about new accounting standards and other accounting
matters:

•

Note 8 for FSP 106-2 regarding the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act related to retirement plans and other benefits;

•

Note 18 for EITF 02-3 and DIG Issue No. C15 related to accounting for derivatives
and energy contracts; and

•

Note 20 for FIN No. 46R related to variable interest entities.

3. Regulatory Matters

Electric Industry Restructuring

State

APS General Rate Case; 2004 Settlement Agreement

On June 27, 2003, APS filed a general rate case with the ACC and requested a $175.1 million,
or 9.8%, increase in its annual retail electricity revenues, intended to become effective July 1,
2004. In this rate case, APS updated its cost of service and rate design.

The general rate case also addresses the implementation of rate adjustment mechanisms that
were the subject of ACC hearings in April 2003. The rate adjustment mechanisms, which were
authorized as a result of the 1999 Settlement Agreement, would allow APS to recover several types
of costs, the most significant of which are power supply costs (fuel and purchased power costs) and
costs associated with complying with the Rules.

On August 18, 2004, a substantial majority of the parties to the rate case, including APS, the
ACC staff, the Arizona Residential Utility Consumer Office, other customer groups, and merchant power plant
intervenors entered into an agreement that proposes terms under which the rate case would be
settled (the “2004 Settlement Agreement”).

Key financial components of the 2004 Settlement Agreement, which is subject to ACC approval,
are as follows:

•

APS would receive an annual retail rate increase of approximately $75.5 million, or
4.21%. The increase would consist of an increase in base rates of approximately 3.77%
and an increase of approximately 0.44% for recovery over five years of the past costs
of compliance with the ACC’s retail electric competition rules.

•

APS would acquire the PWEC Dedicated Assets from Pinnacle West Energy, with a net
carrying value of approximately $850 million, and rate base the PWEC Dedicated Assets
at a rate base value of $700 million, which would result in a mandatory rate base
disallowance of $150 million. As a result, for financial reporting purposes, APS would
recognize a one-time, after-tax net plant write-off of approximately $90 million in the
period when the plant transfer to APS is completed and would reduce annual depreciation
expense by approximately $5 million.

•

To bridge the time between the effective date of the rate increase and the actual
date the PWEC Dedicated Assets transfer, APS and Pinnacle West Energy would enter into
a cost-based purchase power agreement (the “Bridge PPA”), which would be based on the
value of the PWEC Dedicated Assets described in the previous bullet point. The Bridge
PPA would remain in effect until the FERC approves the transfer of the PWEC Dedicated
Assets to APS and the transfer is completed.

•

If the FERC were to issue an order denying APS’ request to acquire the PWEC
Dedicated Assets, the Bridge PPA would become a 30-year purchased power
agreement, with prices reflecting cost-of-service as if APS had



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

acquired and rate-based the PWEC Dedicated Assets at the value described
above.

•

If the FERC were to issue an order (a) approving APS’ request to transfer
the PWEC Dedicated Assets at a value materially less than $700 million, (b)
approving the transfer of fewer than all of the PWEC Dedicated Assets, or (c)
that was materially inconsistent with the 2004 Settlement Agreement, APS would
file an appropriate application with the ACC so that rates could be adjusted.
In these circumstances, the Bridge PPA would continue at least until the
conclusion of the subsequent proceeding to consider any appropriate adjustment
to APS’ rates.

•

A PSA would provide for the recovery of variations in fuel and purchased
power costs, subject to specified parameters and procedures.

•

APS would not restore and recover in rates the $234 million write-off recorded in
1999 as a result of the 1999 Settlement Agreement. As a result, annual amortization
expense for financial reporting purposes would be approximately $16 million less than
if the $234 million write-off had been restored and amortized over a 15-year period as
originally requested.

•

APS would adopt longer service lives than originally requested for certain
depreciable assets, which would have the effect of reducing annual depreciation expense
for financial reporting purposes by approximately $26 million.

On February 28, 2005, the administrative law judge in the general rate case issued a
recommended order. The recommended order proposes ACC approval of the 2004 Settlement Agreement
with two changes related to the PSA. First, the amount of gas costs that APS could recover under
the annual PSA would be limited to $500 million per year. Second, although the 2004 Settlement
Agreement provides that the PSA would remain in effect for a minimum five-year period, under the
recommended order the ACC would be able to eliminate the PSA at any time, if appropriate, if APS
files a rate case before the expiration of the five-year period or APS does not comply with the
terms of the PSA. If APS exceeds the gas costs that could be recoverable under the PSA or if the
ACC eliminates the PSA, APS would retain the right to file a rate case to reset its base rates.

On
March 14, 2005, the parties to the 2004 Settlement Agreement
jointly filed suggested changes to the recommended order
addressing, among other things, the recommended order’s proposed
treatment of the PSA. The ACC has scheduled open
meetings on March 25 and March 28, 2005 to consider the
recommended order and suggested changes. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ACC Financing Order

On May 12, 2003, APS issued $500 million of debt pursuant to the Financing Order and made a
$500 million loan to Pinnacle West Energy. Pinnacle West Energy distributed the net proceeds of
that loan to us to fund the repayment of a portion of the debt we incurred to finance the
construction of the PWEC Dedicated Assets.

The ACC granted the Financing Order subject to various conditions. One of these conditions is
that APS must maintain a common equity ratio of at least forty percent and may not pay common
dividends if such payment would reduce its common equity ratio below that threshold, unless
otherwise waived by the ACC.

In addition, the Financing Order required the ACC staff to conduct an inquiry into our and our
affiliates’ compliance with the retail electric competition and related rules and decisions. On
June 13, 2003, APS submitted its report on these matters to the ACC staff. As part of the 2004
Settlement Agreement, this inquiry would be concluded with no further action by the ACC.

Retail Electric Competition Rules

The Rules approved by the ACC include the following major provisions:



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

unaffiliated party or parties or to a separate corporate affiliate or affiliates.
Under the 1999 Settlement Agreement, APS received a waiver to allow transfer of its
competitive electric assets and services to affiliates no later than December 31,
2002. However, as discussed below, in 2002 the ACC reversed its decision, as
reflected in the Rules, to require APS to transfer its generation assets.

Under the 1999 Settlement Agreement, the Rules are to be interpreted and applied, to the
greatest extent possible, in a manner consistent with the 1999 Settlement Agreement. If the two
cannot be reconciled, APS must seek, and the other parties to the 1999 Settlement Agreement must
support, a waiver of the Rules in favor of the 1999 Settlement Agreement.

On November 27, 2000, a Maricopa County, Arizona, Superior Court judge issued a final judgment
holding that the Rules are unconstitutional and unlawful in their entirety due to failure to
establish a fair value rate base for competitive electric service providers and because certain of
the Rules were not submitted to the Arizona Attorney General for certification. The judgment also
invalidates all ACC orders authorizing competitive electric service providers, including APS Energy
Services, to operate in Arizona. We do not believe the ruling affected the 1999 Settlement
Agreement. The 1999 Settlement Agreement was not at issue in the consolidated cases before the
judge. Further, the ACC made findings related to the fair value of APS’ property in the order
approving the 1999 Settlement Agreement. The ACC and other parties aligned with the ACC appealed
the ruling to the Arizona Court of Appeals, and in January 2004, the Court invalidated some, but
not all, of the Rules as either violative of Arizona’s constitutional requirement that the ACC
consider the “fair value” of a utility’s property in setting rates or as being beyond the ACC’s
constitutional and statutory powers. Other Rules were set aside for failure to submit such
regulations to the Arizona Attorney General for approval as required by statute. A request for the
Arizona Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals decision was denied on January 4, 2005.

Track A Order

On September 10, 2002, the ACC issued the Track A Order, in which the ACC, among other things:

•

reversed its decision, as reflected in the Rules, to require APS to transfer its
generation assets either to an unrelated third party or to a separate corporate
affiliate; and

•

unilaterally modified the 1999 Settlement Agreement, which authorized APS’ transfer
of its generating assets, and directed APS to cancel its activities to transfer its
generation assets to Pinnacle West Energy.

On November 15, 2002, APS filed appeals of the Track A Order in the Maricopa County, Arizona
Superior Court and in the Arizona Court of Appeals.

Arizona Public Service Company vs. Arizona
Corporation Commission

, CV 2002-0222 32.

Arizona Public Service Company vs. Arizona
Corporation Commission

, 1CA CC 02-0002. On December 13, 2002, APS and the ACC staff agreed to
principles for resolving certain issues raised by APS in its appeals of the Track A Order. The
major provisions of the principles include, among other things, the following:

•

APS and the ACC staff agreed that it would be appropriate for the ACC to consider
the following matters in APS’ general rate case, which was filed on June 27, 2003:



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

•

the generating assets to be included in APS’ rate base,
including the question of whether the PWEC Dedicated Assets should be included
in APS’ rate base;

•

the appropriate treatment of the $234 million pretax asset
write-off agreed to by APS as part of the 1999 Settlement Agreement; and

•

the appropriate treatment of costs incurred by APS in
preparation for the previously anticipated transfer of generation assets to
Pinnacle West Energy.

•

As a result of the ACC’s issuance of the Financing Order, APS’ appeals of the Track
A Order are limited to the issues described in the preceding bullet points.

On August 27, 2003, APS, Pinnacle West and Pinnacle West Energy filed a lawsuit asserting
damage claims relating to the Track A Order.

Arizona Public Service Company et al. v. The
State of Arizona ex rel.

, Superior Court of the State of Arizona, County of Maricopa, No.
CV2003-016372.

Upon the ACC’s issuance of a final, non-appealable order approving the 2004 Settlement
Agreement, APS, Pinnacle West, and Pinnacle West Energy will dismiss the litigation described under
this “Track A” heading.

Track B Order

On March 14, 2003, the ACC issued the Track B Order, which required APS to solicit bids for
certain estimated amounts of capacity and energy for periods beginning July 1, 2003. For 2003, APS
was required to solicit competitive bids for about 2,500 MW of capacity and about 4,600
gigawatt-hours of energy, or approximately 20% of APS’ total retail energy requirements.

APS issued requests for proposals in March 2003 and, by May 6, 2003, APS entered into
contracts to meet all or a portion of its requirements for the years 2003 through 2006 as follows:

(1)

Pinnacle West Energy agreed to provide 1,700 MW in July through September of
2003 and in June through September of 2004, 2005 and 2006, by means of a unit
contingent contract.

(2)

PPL EnergyPlus, LLC agreed to provide 112 MW in July through September of 2003
and 150 MW in June through September of 2004 and 2005, by means of a unit contingent
contract.

(3)

Panda Gila River LP agreed to provide 450 MW in October of 2003 and 2004 and
May of 2004 and 2005, and 225 MW from November 2003 through April 2004 and from
November 2004 through April 2005, by means of firm call options.

Effective upon final ACC approval of the 2004 Settlement Agreement and the closing of the
purchase of the Sundance Plant discussed below, the Track B contracts with Pinnacle West Energy and
PPL Energy Plus, LLC will be cancelled.

Request for Proposals and Asset Purchase Agreement

In early December 2003, APS issued a request for proposals (“2003 RFP”) for long-term power
supply resources. On June 1, 2004, APS and PPL Sundance, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PPL
Corporation, entered into an asset purchase agreement by which APS agreed to purchase the Sundance
Plant. The Sundance Plant, which began commercial operation in July 2002, would provide peaking
generation support for APS’ system and reduce APS’ growing needs for new generation resources. The
purchase price for the Sundance Plant is approximately $190 million.

On June 1, 2004, APS and PPL Sundance filed a joint application with the ACC with respect to
APS’ proposed acquisition of the Sundance Plant. On January 20, 2005, the ACC issued an order
confirming APS’ authority to “self-build or buy new generation assets for native load” and stated
that APS’ acquisition of the Sundance Plant would be a proper purpose under APS’ existing ACC
financing authorizations. APS’ filings with the ACC also had requested that the ACC allow APS to
defer for future recovery certain capital and operating costs (net of fuel and purchased power
savings) associated with the Sundance Plant acquisition until rate treatment for the Sundance Plant
could be considered in APS’ next general rate case. APS’ filings estimated that the deferrals
would be approximately $10 million to $15 million before income taxes on an annualized basis. The
order issued by the ACC allows APS to record the deferrals for up to 36 months, subject to a number
of conditions. However, if APS has a general rate case pending at the end of the 36-month period,
the deferral period could extend until the rate case had been decided. The conditions imposed by
the order are expected to substantially limit the amount of deferrals that APS will be able to
record.

APS’ acquisition of the Sundance Plant is subject to FERC approval and to customary closing
conditions. The transaction is targeted to close in the spring of 2005.

APS does not expect to enter into any additional transactions as a result of the 2003 RFP.

Provider of Last Resort Obligation

Although the Rules allow retail customers to have access to competitive providers of energy
and energy services, APS is, under the Rules, the “provider of last resort” for standard-offer,
full-service customers under rates that have been approved by the ACC. In the event of shortfalls
due to unforeseen increases in load demand or generation or transmission outages, APS may need to
purchase additional supplemental power in the wholesale spot market. At various times, prices in
the spot wholesale market have significantly exceeded the amount included in APS’ current retail
rates. There can be no assurance that APS would be able to fully recover the costs of this power.
The proposed settlement of APS’ general rate case, discussed above, would, among other things,
allow APS to recover purchased power costs.

1999 Settlement Agreement

The following are the major provisions of a settlement agreement entered into in 1999, as
approved by the ACC:

•

APS has reduced rates for standard-offer service for customers with loads less than
three MW in a series of annual retail electricity price reductions of 1.5% on July 1
for each of the years 1999 to 2003 for a total of 7.5%. Based on the price reductions
authorized in the 1999 Settlement Agreement, there were retail price decreases of



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

approximately $24 million ($14 million after taxes), effective July 1, 1999;
approximately $28 million ($17 million after taxes), effective July 1, 2000;
approximately $27 million ($16 million after taxes), effective July 1, 2001;
approximately $28 million ($17 million after taxes), effective July 1, 2002; and
approximately $29 million ($18 million after taxes), effective July 1, 2003. For
customers having loads of three MW or greater, standard-offer rates have been
reduced in varying annual increments that total 5% in the years 1999 through 2002.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

•

The 1999 Settlement Agreement required APS to form, or cause to be formed, a
separate corporate affiliate or affiliates and transfer to such affiliate(s) its
competitive electric assets and services no later than December 31, 2002. The 1999
Settlement Agreement provided that APS would be allowed to defer and later collect,
beginning July 1, 2004, 67% of its costs to accomplish the required transfer of
generation assets to an affiliate. However, as discussed above under “Track A Order,”
in 2002 the ACC unilaterally modified this aspect of the 1999 Settlement Agreement by
issuing an order preventing APS from transferring its generation assets. Under the
2004 Settlement Agreement, APS would recover all costs incurred by APS in preparation
for the previously anticipated transfer of generation assets to Pinnacle West Energy.
See “APS General Rate Case; 2004 Settlement Agreement” above. Such full recovery of
divestiture costs would be allowed under the 2004 Settlement Agreement (see above).

General

The regulatory developments and legal challenges to the Rules discussed in this Note have
raised considerable uncertainty about the status and pace of retail electric competition and of
electric restructuring in Arizona. Although some very limited retail competition existed in APS’
service area in 1999 and 2000, there are currently no active retail competitors providing unbundled
energy or other utility services to APS’ customers. As a result, we cannot predict when, and the
extent to which, additional competitors will re-enter APS’ service territory. As competition in
the electric industry continues to evolve, we will continue to evaluate strategies and alternatives
that will position us to compete in the new regulatory environment.

Federal

In July 2002, the FERC adopted a price mitigation plan that constrains the price of
electricity in the wholesale spot electricity market in the western United States. The FERC
adopted a price cap of $250 per MWh for the period subsequent to October 31, 2002. Sales at prices
above the cap must be justified and are subject to potential refund.

On July 31, 2002, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for Standard Market Design
for wholesale electric markets. Voluminous comments and reply comments were filed on virtually
every aspect of the proposed rule. On April 28, 2003, the FERC Staff issued an additional white
paper on the proposed Standard Market Design. The white paper discusses several policy changes to
the proposed Standard Market Design, including a greater emphasis on flexibility for regional
needs. We cannot currently predict what, if any, impact there may be to the Company if the FERC
adopts the proposed rule or any modifications proposed in the comments.

The FERC has been, though its Office of Marker Oversight and Investigations (OMOI), in the
process of auditing a number of electric utilities regarding compliance with its regulations.
Such an audit of APS and its affiliates was recently completed, and the FERC has issued an order
approving the OMOI audit report and directing certain compliance actions.

Service Company

, 109 FERC ¶ 61,271 (2004).

Chief among the FERC’s findings, APS must pay $4 million for its use of unauthorized
point-to-point transmission service. Of the $4 million, APS must distribute: (1) $2.75 million to
upgrade the West Phoenix-Lincoln Street 230kV transmission line with high capacity composite

conductors; and (2) $1.25 million as a contribution to established low income energy assistance
programs in Arizona. APS must not recover these monies from any existing or future wholesale or
retail rate recovery mechanism, nor may it announce the low income payment as a public interest
contribution. APS must also take certain corrective actions and make quarterly filings detailing
its progress in implementing these actions until all are completed.

APS believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on
its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

General

The regulatory developments and legal challenges to the Rules discussed in this Note have
raised considerable uncertainty about the status and pace of retail electric competition and of
electric restructuring in Arizona. Although some very limited retail competition existed in APS’
service area in 1999 and 2000, there are currently no active retail competitors providing unbundled
energy or other utility services to APS’ customers. As a result, we cannot predict when, and the
extent to which, additional competitors will re-enter APS’ service territory. As competition in
the electric industry continues to evolve, we will continue to evaluate strategies and alternatives
that will position us to compete in the new regulatory environment.

4. Income Taxes

Certain assets and liabilities are reported differently for income tax purposes than they are
for financial statements. The tax effect of these differences is recorded as deferred taxes. We
calculate deferred taxes using the current income tax rates.

APS has recorded a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability related to income taxes on its
Balance Sheets in accordance with SFAS No. 71. The regulatory asset is for certain temporary
differences, primarily the allowance for equity funds used during construction. The regulatory
liability relates to excess deferred taxes resulting primarily from the reduction in federal income
tax rates as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. APS amortizes this amount as the differences
reverse.

As a result of a change in IRS guidance, we claimed a tax
deduction related to an APS tax accounting method change on the 2001 federal consolidated income
tax return. The accelerated deduction resulted in a $200 million reduction in the current income
tax liability and a corresponding increase in the plant-related deferred tax liability. In 2002,
we received an income tax refund of approximately $115 million related to our 2001 federal
consolidated income tax return. The 2001 federal consolidated income tax return is currently under
examination by the IRS. As part of this ongoing examination, the IRS is reviewing this accounting
method change and the resultant deduction. During 2004, the current income tax liability was
increased, with a corresponding decrease to plant-related deferred tax liability, to reflect the
expected outcome of this audit. We do not expect the ultimate outcome of this examination to have
a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The income tax liability accounts reflect the tax and interest associated with the most
probable resolution of all known and measurable tax exposures.

In 2004 and 2003, we resolved certain prior-year issues with the taxing authorities and
recorded tax benefits associated with tax credits and other reductions to income tax expense.

5. Lines of Credit and Short-Term Borrowings

APS had committed lines of credit with various banks of $325 million at December 31, 2004 and
$250 million at December 31, 2003, which were available either to support the issuance of up to
$250 million in commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings, including issuance of letters
of credit. The current line matures in May 2007. The commitment fees at December 31, 2004 and 2003
for these lines of credit were 0.15% and 0.175% per annum. APS had no bank borrowings outstanding
under these lines of credit at December 31, 2004 and 2003. APS had approximately $4.8 million
letters of credit issued under the line at December 31, 2004.

APS had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003. By Arizona
statute, APS’ short-term borrowings cannot exceed 7% of its total capitalization unless approved by
the ACC.

Pinnacle West had committed lines of credit of $300 million at December 31, 2004 and $275
million at December 31, 2003, which were available either to support the issuance of up to $250



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

million in commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings, including issuance of letters
of credit. The current lines mature in October 2007. Pinnacle West had no outstanding borrowings
at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. Pinnacle West had approximately $13 million of letters
of credit issued under the line at December 31, 2004 and approximately $15 million of letters of
credit issued under the line at December 31, 2003. The commitment fees were 0.175% in 2004 and
ranged from 0.125% to 0.175% in 2003. Pinnacle West had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding
at December 31, 2004 and 2003. All APS and Pinnacle West bank lines of credit and commercial paper
agreements are unsecured.

SunCor had revolving lines of credit totaling $90 million at December 31, 2004 and $120
million at December 31, 2003. The commitment fees were 0.125% in 2004 and 2003. SunCor had $35
million outstanding at December 31, 2004 and $50 million outstanding at December 31, 2003. The
weighted-average interest rate was 4.50% at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Interest for 2004 and 2003
was based on LIBOR plus 2% or prime plus 0.5%. The balance is included in short-term debt on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. SunCor had other short-term loans in the amount of $36 million at
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. These loans are made up of multiple notes primarily with
variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus 2.5% at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

6. Long-Term Debt

APS has retired all first mortgage bonds issued under its 1946 mortgage and deed of trust,
including the first mortgage bonds securing APS senior notes. On April 30, 2004, APS terminated
its mortgage and deed of trust and, as a result, is not able to issue any additional first mortgage
bonds under that mortgage. SunCor’s short and long-term debt is collateralized by interests in
certain real property and Pinnacle West’s debt is unsecured. The following table presents the
components of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets outstanding at December 31, 2004

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Pinnacle West’s and APS’ debt covenants related to their respective bank financing
arrangements include a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio and an interest coverage test. Pinnacle
West and APS comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet those and
other significant covenant requirements. These covenants require that the ratio of debt to total
capitalization cannot exceed 65% for the Company and for APS. At December 31, 2004, the ratio was
approximately 53% for Pinnacle West and 54% for APS. The provisions regarding interest



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

coverage require a minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for each of the
Company and APS. Based on 2004 results, the coverages were approximately 4 times for the Company
and 4 times for APS. Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of
default which, generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the
covenants.

Neither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’ financing agreements contain “ratings triggers” that would
result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings
downgrade. However, in the event of a ratings downgrade, Pinnacle West and/or APS may be subject
to increased interest costs under certain financing agreements.

All of Pinnacle West’s bank agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in
defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or
APS were to default under other agreements. All of APS’ bank agreements contain cross-default
provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank
agreements if APS were to default under other agreements. Pinnacle West’s and APS’ credit
agreements generally contain provisions under which the lenders could refuse to advance loans in
the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition or financial prospects, except
that Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver
borrowings equal to outstanding commercial paper amounts.

The following is a list of principal payments due on Pinnacle West’s total long-term debt and
capitalized lease requirements:

8. Retirement Plans and Other Benefits

Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a
non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and
our subsidiaries. Effective January 1, 2003, Pinnacle West sponsored a new account balance plan
for all new employees in place of the defined benefit plan and, as of April 1, 2003, the plan was
offered as an alternative to the defined benefit plan for all existing employees. A defined
benefit plan specifies the amount of benefits a plan participant is to receive using information
about the participant. The pension plan covers nearly all of our employees. The supplemental
excess benefit retirement plan covers officers of the Company and highly compensated employees
designated for participation by the Board of Directors. Our employees do not contribute to the
plans. Generally, we calculate the benefits based on age, years of service and pay.

Pinnacle West also sponsors other postretirement benefits for the employees of Pinnacle West
and our subsidiaries. We provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees.
Employees must retire to become eligible for these retirement benefits, which are based on years of
service and age. For the medical insurance plans, retirees make contributions to cover a portion
of the plan costs. For the life insurance plan, retirees do not make contributions. We retain the
right to change or eliminate these benefits.

Pinnacle West uses a December 31 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement
benefit plans.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On December 8, 2003, the President signed the “Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003” (the Act). One feature of the Act is a government subsidy of
prescription drug cost. The FASB issued FSP 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related
to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,” to address the
accounting for the effects of the Act. During the third quarter of 2004, we retroactively adopted
the provisions of FSP 106-2, resulting in the remeasurement of our postretirement benefit plans’
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2003. The impact of the subsidy
is a decrease in the accumulated projected benefit obligation of approximately $65 million and a
decrease of approximately $11 million in the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2004.
The 2004 after-tax reduction to expense is approximately $5 million, excluding amounts capitalized
as construction overhead or billed to electric plant participants

.

The following table provides details of the plans’ benefit costs. Also included is the
portion of these costs charged to expense, including administrative costs and excluding amounts
capitalized as overhead construction or billed to electric plant participants (dollars in

In selecting the pretax expected long-term rate of return on plan assets we consider past
performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan. For the year 2005
we are assuming a 9% rate of return on plan assets. As recent history has demonstrated, markets
may decline and increase dramatically. However, we believe the long-term rate of return on plan
assets of 9% is reasonable given our asset allocation in relation to historical and expected future
performance.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the
health care plans. A 1% change in the assumed initial and ultimate health care cost trend rates
would have the following effects (dollars in millions):

The Board of Directors has established an investment policy for the pension plan assets and
has delegated oversight of the plan assets to an Investment Management Committee. The investment
policy sets forth the objective of providing for future pension benefits by maximizing return
consistent with acceptable levels of risk. The primary investment strategies are diversification
of assets, stated asset allocation targets and ranges, prohibition of investments in Pinnacle West
securities, and external management of plan assets.

Pinnacle West’s other postretirement benefit plans’ asset allocation at December 31, 2004 and
2003, is as follows:

The Investment Management Committee, described above, has also been delegated oversight of the
plan assets for the postretirement benefit plans. The investment policy for other postretirement
benefit plans assets is similar to that of the pension plan assets described above.

Contributions

The minimum required contribution to be made to our pension plan in 2005 is estimated to be
approximately $50 million. The contribution to be made to other postretirement benefit plans in
2005 is estimated to be approximately $40 million. APS’ share is approximately 92% of both plans.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

Benefit payments, which reflect estimated future employee service, for the next five years and
the succeeding five years thereafter are estimated to be as follows (dollars in thousands):

Employee Savings Plan Benefits

Pinnacle West sponsors a defined contribution savings plan for eligible employees of Pinnacle
West and subsidiaries. In 2004 APS represented 91% of the total cost of this plan. In a defined
contribution savings plan, the benefits a participant receives result from regular contributions
participants make to their own individual account. Under this plan, the Company matches a
percentage of the participants’ contributions in the form of Pinnacle West stock. After a five
year vesting period, participants have an option to transfer the Company matching contributions out
of the Pinnacle West Stock Fund to other investment funds within the plan. At December 31, 2004,
approximately 22% of total plan assets were in Pinnacle West stock. Pinnacle West recorded
expenses for this plan of approximately $5 million for each of the years 2004, 2003 and 2002. APS
recorded expenses for this plan of approximately $5 million in 2004, $5 million in 2003 and $4
million in 2002.

9. Leases

In 1986, APS sold about 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain common facilities in
three separate sale leaseback transactions. APS accounts for these leases as operating leases.
The gain resulting from the transaction of approximately $140 million was deferred and is being
amortized to operations and maintenance expense over 29.5 years, the original term of the leases.
There are options to renew the leases for two additional years and to purchase the property for
fair market value at the end of the lease terms. Rent expense is calculated on a straight-line
basis. See Note 20 for a discussion of VIEs, including the SPEs involved in the Palo Verde sale
leaseback transactions.

In addition, we lease certain land, buildings, equipment, vehicles and miscellaneous other
items through operating rental agreements with varying terms, provisions and expiration dates.

Total lease expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $69 million in
2004, $67 million in 2003 and $67 million in 2002.

The amounts to be paid for the Palo Verde Unit 2 leases are approximately $49 million per year
for the years 2005 to 2015.

Estimated future minimum lease payments for Pinnacle West’s operating leases are approximately
as follows (dollars in millions):

11. Commitments and Contingencies

Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station

Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal

Nuclear power plant operators are required to enter into spent fuel disposal contracts with
the DOE, and the DOE is required to accept and dispose of all spent nuclear fuel and other
high-level radioactive wastes generated by domestic power reactors. Although the Nuclear Waste Act
required the DOE to develop a permanent repository for the storage and disposal of spent nuclear
fuel by 1998, the DOE has announced that the repository cannot be completed before 2010 and it does
not intend to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel prior to that date. In November 1997, the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) issued a decision
preventing the DOE from excusing its own delay, but refused to order the DOE to begin accepting
spent nuclear fuel. Based on this decision and the DOE’s delay, a number of utilities, including
APS (on behalf of itself and the other Palo Verde owners), filed damages actions against the DOE in
the Court of Federal Claims.

Arizona Public Service Company v. United States of America

,
United States Court of Federal Claims, 03-2832C.

In February 2002, the Secretary of Energy recommended to President Bush that the Yucca
Mountain, Nevada site be developed as a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel. The President
transmitted this recommendation to Congress and the State of Nevada vetoed the President’s
recommendation. Congress approved the Yucca Mountain site, overriding the Nevada veto. The State
of Nevada has filed several lawsuits relating to the Yucca Mountain site. We cannot currently
predict what further steps will be taken in this area.

APS has existing fuel storage pools at Palo Verde and is operating a new facility for on-site
dry storage of spent nuclear fuel. With the existing storage pools and the addition of the new
facility, APS believes spent nuclear fuel storage or disposal methods will be available for use by
Palo Verde to allow its continued operation through the term of the operating license for each Palo
Verde unit.

Although some low-level waste has been stored on-site in a low-level waste facility, APS is
currently shipping low-level waste to off-site facilities. APS currently believes interim
low-level waste storage methods are or will be available for use by Palo Verde to allow its
continued operation and to safely store low-level waste until a permanent disposal facility is
available.

APS currently estimates it will incur $115 million (in 2004 dollars) over the life of Palo
Verde for its share of the costs related to the on-site interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. As
of December 31, 2004, APS had spent $11 million for on-site interim spent nuclear fuel storage.
APS has recorded a regulatory asset of $11 million and is currently seeking recovery of these costs
through future rates (see “APS General Rate Case; 2004 Settlement Agreement” in Note 3).

APS believes that scientific and financial aspects of the issues of spent nuclear fuel and
low-level waste storage and disposal can be resolved satisfactorily. However, APS acknowledges
that their ultimate resolution in a timely fashion will require political resolve and action on
national and regional scales which APS is less able to predict. APS expects to vigorously protect
and pursue its rights related to this matter.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Nuclear Insurance

The Palo Verde participants have insurance for public liability resulting from nuclear energy
hazards to the full limit of liability under federal law. This potential liability is covered by
primary liability insurance provided by commercial insurance carriers in the amount of $300 million
and the balance by an industry-wide retrospective assessment program. If losses at any nuclear
power plant covered by the programs exceed the accumulated funds, APS could be assessed
retrospective premium adjustments. The maximum assessment per reactor under the program for each
nuclear incident is approximately $101 million, subject to an annual limit of $10 million per
incident. Based on APS’ interest in the three Palo Verde units, APS’ maximum potential assessment
per incident for all three units is approximately $88 million, with an annual payment limitation of
approximately $9 million.

The Palo Verde participants maintain “all risk” (including nuclear hazards) insurance for
property damage to, and decontamination of, property at Palo Verde in the aggregate amount of $2.75
billion, a substantial portion of which must first be applied to stabilization and decontamination.
APS has also secured insurance against portions of any increased cost of generation or purchased
power and business interruption resulting from a sudden and unforeseen outage of any of the three
units. The insurance coverage discussed in this and the previous paragraph is subject to certain
policy conditions and exclusions.

Purchased Power and Fuel Commitments

APS and Pinnacle West are parties to various purchased power and fuel contracts with terms
expiring from 2005 through 2025 that include required purchase provisions. We estimate the
contract requirements to be approximately $187 million in 2005; $90 million in 2006; $81 million in
2007; $66 million in 2008; $68 million in 2009 and $363 million thereafter. However, these amounts
may vary significantly pursuant to certain provisions in such contracts that permit us to decrease
required purchases under certain circumstances.

Of the various purchased power and fuel contracts mentioned above some of those contracts have
take-or-pay provisions. The contracts APS has for the supply of its coal supply have take-or-pay
provisions. The current take-or-pay coal contracts have terms that expire in 2016.

The following table summarizes the estimated take-or-pay commitments for the existing terms
(dollars in millions):

Coal Mine Reclamation Obligations

APS must reimburse certain coal providers for amounts incurred for coal mine reclamation.
APS’ coal mine reclamation obligation was $61 million at December 31, 2004 and $60 million at
December 31, 2003 and is included in deferred credits-other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

California Energy Market Issues and Refunds in the Pacific Northwest

FERC

In July 2001, the FERC ordered an expedited fact-finding hearing to calculate refunds
for spot market transactions in California during a specified time frame. APS was a seller and a
purchaser in the California markets at issue, and to the extent that refunds are ordered, APS
should be a recipient as well as a payor of such amounts. The FERC is still considering the
evidence and refund amounts have not yet been finalized. APS does not anticipate material changes
in its exposure and still believes, subject to the finalization of the revised proxy prices, that
it will be entitled to a net refund.

On March 19, 2002, the State of California filed a complaint with the FERC alleging that
wholesale sellers of power and energy, including the Company, failed to properly file rate
information at the FERC in connection with sales to California from 2000 to the present under
market-based rates.

State of California v. British Columbia Power Exchange et al.

, Docket
No. EL02-71-000. The complaint requests the FERC to require the wholesale sellers to refund any
rates that are “found to exceed just and reasonable levels.” This complaint was dismissed by the
FERC and the State of California appealed the matter to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In an
order issued September 9, 2004, the Ninth Circuit upheld the FERC’s authority to permit
market-based rates, but rejected the FERC’s claim that it was without authority to consider
retroactive refunds when a utility has not strictly adhered to the quarterly reporting requirements
of the market-based rate system. On September 9, 2004, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the
FERC for further proceedings.

State of California ex rel. Bill Lockyer, Attorney General v.
FERC

, No. 02-73093. Several of the intervenors in this appeal filed a petition for rehearing
of this decision on October 25, 2004. The outcome of the further proceedings cannot be predicted
at this time.

The FERC also ordered an evidentiary proceeding to discuss and evaluate possible refunds for
the Pacific Northwest. The FERC affirmed the ALJ’s conclusion that the prices in the Pacific
Northwest were not unreasonable or unjust and refunds should not be ordered in this proceeding.
This decision has now been appealed to the Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). Although the FERC
ruling in the Pacific Northwest matter is being appealed and the FERC has not yet calculated the
specific refund amounts due in California, we do not expect that the resolution of these issues, as
to the amounts alleged in the proceedings, will have a material adverse impact on our financial

On March 26, 2003, FERC made public a Final Report on Price Manipulation in Western Markets,
prepared by its staff and covering spot markets in the West in 2000 and 2001. The report stated
that a significant number of entities who participated in the California markets during the
2000-2001 time period, including APS, may potentially have been involved in arbitrage transactions
that allegedly violated certain provisions of the ISO tariff. After reviewing the matter, along
with the data supplied by APS, the FERC staff moved to dismiss the claims against APS and to
dismiss the proceeding. The motion to dismiss was granted by the FERC on January 22, 2004.
Certain parties have sought rehearing of this order, and that request is pending.

California Civil Energy Market Litigation

The State of California and others have filed
various claims, which have now been consolidated, against several power suppliers to California
alleging antitrust violations.

Wholesale Electricity Antitrust Cases I and II

, Superior
Court in and for the County of San Diego, Proceedings Nos. 4204-00005 and 4204-00006. Two of the
suppliers who were named as defendants in those matters, Reliant Energy Services, Inc. (and other
Reliant entities) and Duke Energy and Trading, LLP (and other Duke entities), filed cross-claims
against various other participants in the PX and California independent system operator markets,
including APS, attempting to expand those matters to such other participants. APS has not yet
filed a responsive pleading in the matter, but APS believes the claims by Reliant and Duke as they
relate to APS are without merit.

APS was also named in a lawsuit regarding wholesale contracts in California, which, after
moving to state court, has been removed to the federal court for a second time.

James Millar,
et al. v. Allegheny Energy Supply, et al.

, San Francisco Superior Court, Case No. 407867, U.S.
District Court (Northern District) C-04-0519 SBA. The First Amended Complaint alleges basically
that the contracts entered into were the result of an unfair and unreasonable market, in violation
of California unfair competition laws. The PX has filed a lawsuit against the State of California
regarding the seizure of forward contracts and the State has filed a cross complaint against APS
and numerous other PX participants.

Cal PX v. The State of California

, Superior Court in
and for the County of Sacramento, JCCP No. 4203. Various motions continue to be filed, and we
currently believe these claims will have no material adverse impact on our financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

Natural Gas Supply

Pursuant to the terms of a comprehensive settlement entered into in 1996 with El Paso Natural
Gas Company, the rates charged for natural gas transportation are subject to a rate moratorium
through December 31, 2005.

On July 9, 2003 the FERC issued an order that altered the capacity rights of parties to the
1996 settlement but maintained the cost responsibility provisions agreed to by parties to that
settlement. The D.C. Court of Appeals recently upheld the FERC’s authority to alter the capacity rights
of parties to the settlement. With respect to the FERC’s authority to maintain the cost responsibility
provisions of the settlement, a party has sought appellate review and is seeking to reallocate the
costs responsibility associated with the changed contractual obligations in a way that would be
less favorable to APS and Pinnacle West Energy than under the FERC’s July 9, 2003 order. Should this
party prevail on this point, APS and Pinnacle West Energy’s annual capacity cost could be increased
by approximately $3 million per year, from September 2003 through December 2005.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

El Paso is required under the terms of the 1996 settlement to file a new rate case by July 1,
2005, with new rates to become effective on January 1, 2006. APS cannot currently assess the
financial impact that El Paso’s filing could have on rates.

Navajo Nation Litigation

In June 1999, the Navajo Nation served Salt River Project with a lawsuit naming Salt River
Project, several Peabody Coal Company entities (collectively, “Peabody”), Southern California
Edison Company and other defendants, and citing various claims in connection with the
renegotiations of the coal royalty and lease agreements under which Peabody mines coal for the
Navajo Generating Station and the Mohave Generating Station.

The Navajo Nation v. Peabody
Holding Company, Inc., et al.

, United States District Court for the District of Columbia,
CA-99-0469-EGS (the “D.C. Lawsuit”). APS is a 14% owner of the Navajo Generating Station, which
Salt River Project operates. The D.C. Lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants
obtained a favorable coal royalty rate by improperly influencing the outcome of a federal
administrative process under which the royalty rate was to be adjusted. The suit seeks $600
million in damages, treble damages, punitive damages of not less than $1 billion, and the ejection
of defendants “from all possessory interests and Navajo Tribal lands arising out of the [primary
coal lease]”. In July 2001, the court dismissed all claims against Salt River Project.

In January, 2005, Peabody served APS with a lawsuit naming APS and the other Navajo Generating
Station participants and seeking, among other things, a declaration that the participants “are
obligated to reimburse Peabody for any royalty, tax, or other obligation arising out of the D.C.
Lawsuit”.

Peabody Western Coal Company v. Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and
Power District, et al.

, Circuit Court for the City of St. Louis, Division No. 1, Cause No.
042-08561. Based on APS’ ownership interest in the Navajo Generating Station, APS could be liable
for up to 14% of any such obligation. Because the litigation is in preliminary stages, APS cannot
currently predict the outcome of this matter.

Litigation

We are party to various other claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary
course of business, including but not limited to environmental matters related to the Clean Air
Act, Navajo Nation issues and EPA and ADEQ issues. In our opinion, the ultimate resolution of
these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

12. Asset Retirement Obligations

APS has asset retirement obligations for its Palo Verde nuclear facilities and certain other
generation, transmission and distribution assets. The Palo Verde asset retirement obligation
primarily relates to final plant decommissioning. This obligation is based on the NRC’s
requirements for disposal of radiated property or plant and agreements APS reached with the ACC for
final decommissioning of the plant. The non-nuclear generation asset retirement obligations
primarily relate to requirements for removing portions of those plants at the end of the plant life
or lease term. Some of APS’ transmission and distribution assets have asset retirement obligations
because they are subject to right of way and easement agreements that require final removal. These
agreements have a history of uninterrupted renewal that APS expects to continue. As a result, APS
cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the asset retirement obligation related to such
distribution and transmission assets. The asset retirement obligations associated with our
non-regulated assets are immaterial.

To fund the costs APS expects to incur to decommission Palo Verde, APS established external
decommissioning trusts in accordance with NRC regulations. APS invests the trust funds in fixed
income and domestic equity securities and classifies them as available for sale. The following
table shows the cost and fair value of APS’ nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets which are on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 (dollars in millions):

14. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We believe that the carrying amounts of our cash equivalents are reasonable estimates of their
fair values at December 31, 2004 and 2003 due to their short maturities.

We hold investments in debt securities for purposes other than trading. We believe that the
carrying amounts of these investments represent reasonable estimates of their fair values at December 31,
2004 and 2003 due to the short-term reset of interest rates.

We also hold investments in fixed income and domestic equity securities for purposes other
than trading. The December 31, 2004 and 2003 fair values of such investments, which we determine
by using quoted market prices, approximate their carrying amount. For further information, see
disclosure of cost and fair value of APS’ nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets in Note 12.

On December 31, 2004, the carrying value of our long-term debt (excluding capitalized lease
obligations) was $3.19 billion, with an estimated fair value of $3.30 billion. The carrying value
of our long-term debt (excluding capitalized lease obligations) was $3.31 billion on December 31,
2003, with an estimated fair value of $3.46 billion. The fair value estimates are based on quoted
market prices of the same or similar issues.

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Options to purchase 1,058,616 shares of common stock were outstanding at December 31, 2004 but
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise
price was greater than the average market price of the common shares. Options to purchase shares
of common stock that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share were
2,291,646 at December 31, 2003 and 1,629,958 at December 31, 2002.

16. Stock-Based Compensation

Pinnacle West offers stock-based compensation plans for officers and key employees of the
Company and our subsidiaries.

In May 2002, shareholders approved the 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2002 plan), which allows
Pinnacle West to grant performance shares, stock ownership incentive awards and non-qualified and
performance-accelerated stock options to key employees. The Company has reserved 6 million shares
of common stock for issuance under the 2002 plan. No more than 1.8 million shares may be issued in
relation to performance share awards and stock ownership incentive awards. The plan also provides
for the granting of new non-qualified stock options at a price per share not less than the fair
market value of the common stock at the time of grant. The stock options vest over three years,
unless certain performance criteria are met, which can accelerate the vesting period. The term of
the option cannot be longer than 10 years and the option cannot be repriced during its term.

The 1994 plan includes outstanding options but no new options will be granted under the plan.
Options vested one-third of the grant per year beginning one year after the date the option is
granted and expire ten years from the date of the grant. The 1994 plan also provided for the
granting of any combination of shares of restricted stock, stock appreciation rights or dividend
equivalents.

In the third quarter of 2002, we began applying the fair value method of accounting for
stock-based compensation, as provided for in SFAS No. 123. The fair value method of accounting is
the preferred method. In accordance with the transition requirements of SFAS No. 123, we applied
the fair value method prospectively, beginning with 2002 stock grants. In prior years, we
recognized stock compensation expense based on the intrinsic value method allowed in APB No. 25.

In addition, see Note 2 for discussion of a new standard on share based payments (SFAS No.
123R).

Total stock-based compensation cost, including restricted stock, performance shares, stock
options, and stock ownership incentives was $8 million in 2004, $6 million in 2003 and $5 million
in 2002 for Pinnacle West, and $6 million in 2004, $3 million in 2003 and $3 million in 2002 for
APS.

The following table is a summary of the status of outstanding stock options under our equity
incentive plans as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 and changes during the years ending on those

17. Business Segments

We have three principal business segments (determined by products, services and the regulatory
environment):

•

our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail
and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electricity service to Native Load
customers) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission and
distribution;

•

our marketing and trading segment, which consists of our competitive energy business
activities, including wholesale marketing and trading and APS Energy Services’
commodity-related energy services; and

•

our real estate segment, which consists of SunCor’s real estate development and
investment activities.

In 2004, our other segment includes a $35 million gain ($21 million after-tax) related to the
sale of El Dorado’s limited partnership interest in the Phoenix Suns. The other segment also
includes activity related to APS Energy Services’ non-commodity trading activities, as well as the
parent company and other subsidiaries.

Financial data for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 by business segments is

18. Derivative and Energy Trading Accounting

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity, natural gas, coal, emissions allowances and in interest rates. We manage
risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various instruments that qualify as
derivatives, including exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options
and swaps. As part of our overall risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge our
exposure to changes in interest rates and to hedge purchases and sales of electricity, fuels, and
emissions allowances and credits. As of December 31, 2004, we hedged exposures to the price
variability of the commodities for a maximum of eight years. The changes in market value of such
contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged transactions. In addition,
subject to specified risk parameters monitored by the ERMC, we engage in marketing and trading
activities intended to profit from market price movements.

We recognize all derivatives, except those which receive a scope exception, as either assets
or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 149. Derivative commodity contracts for the physical delivery
of purchase and sale quantities transacted in the normal course of business receive the normal
purchase and sales exception and are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting. Changes in
the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge
criteria are met. For cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized
in common stock equity (as a component of other comprehensive income (loss)). For fair value
hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged
item associated with the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. We use cash flow hedges to limit
our exposure to cash flow variability on forecasted transactions. We use fair value hedges to
limit our exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability.

We assess hedge effectiveness both at inception and on a continuing basis. Hedge
effectiveness is related to the degree to which the derivative contract and the hedged item are
correlated. It is measured based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative
contract and the hedged item over time. We exclude the time value of certain options from our
assessment of hedge effectiveness. Any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, or
the amount by which the derivative contract and the hedged commodity are not directly correlated,
is recognized immediately in net income.

Both non-trading and trading derivatives that do not receive a scope exception are classified
as assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Certain of our non-trading derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment.
Non-trading derivatives, or any portion thereof that are not effective hedges, are adjusted to fair
value through income. Gains and losses related to non-trading derivatives that qualify as cash
flow hedges of expected transactions are recognized in revenue or purchased power and fuel expense
as an offset to the related item being hedged when the underlying hedged physical transaction
impacts earnings. If it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, we
discontinue the use of hedge accounting and recognize in income the unrealized gains and losses
that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). In the event a non-trading
derivative is terminated or settled, the unrealized gains and losses remain in other comprehensive
income (loss), and are recognized in income when the underlying transaction impacts earnings.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

All gains and losses (realized and unrealized) on trading contracts that qualify as
derivatives are included in marketing and trading segment revenues on the Consolidated Statements
of Income on a net basis. Trading contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative are
accounted for on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the
contracted commodities are delivered or received.

In the electricity business, some contracts to purchase energy are netted against other
contracts to sell energy. This is called “book-out” and usually occurs in contracts that have the
same terms (quantities and delivery points) and for which power does not flow. We net these
book-outs, which reduces both revenues and purchased power and fuel costs in our Consolidated
Statement of Income, but this does not impact our financial condition, net income or cash flows.

In November 2003, the FASB revised its derivative guidance in DIG Issue No. C15, “Normal
Purchases and Normal Sales Exception for Option-Type Contracts and Forward Contracts in
Electricity.” Effective January 1, 2004, the new guidance changed the criteria for the normal
purchases and sales scope exception for electricity contracts. The implementation of this guidance
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

During 2002, the EITF discussed EITF 02-3 and reached a consensus on certain issues. EITF
02-3 rescinded EITF 98-10 and was effective October 25, 2002 for any new contracts, and on January
1, 2003 for existing contracts, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the EITF 02-3 guidance
for all contracts in the fourth quarter of 2002. We recorded a $66 million after-tax charge in net
income as a cumulative effect adjustment for the previously recorded accumulated unrealized
mark-to-market on energy trading contracts that did not meet the accounting definition of a
derivative.

Cash Flow Hedges

The changes in the fair value of our hedged positions included in the Consolidated Statements
of Income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are comprised of the following
(dollars in thousands):




Gains/(losses) on the ineffective portion

During the twelve months ending December 31, 2005, we estimate that a net gain of $44 million
before income taxes will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an offset to
the effect on earnings of market price changes for the related hedged transactions.

Our assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities are presented in two
categories, consistent with our business segments:

•

Regulated Electricity – non-trading derivative instruments that hedge our purchases
and sales of electricity and fuel for APS’ Native Load requirements of our regulated
electricity business segment; and

•

Marketing and Trading – both non-trading and trading derivative instruments of our
competitive business segment.

Cash or other assets may be required to serve as collateral against our open positions on
certain energy-related contracts. Collateral provided to counterparties is $1 million at December
31, 2004 and $1 million at December 31, 2003, and is included in other current assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateral provided to us by counterparties is $18 million at



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2004 and $12 million at December 31, 2003, and is included in other current
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Fair Value Hedges

On January 29, 2004, we entered into two fixed-for-floating interest rate swap transactions on
our $300 million 6.4% Senior Notes. The purpose of these hedges is to protect against significant
fluctuations in the fair value of our debt. Our interest rate swaps are considered to be fully
effective with any resulting gains or losses on the derivative offset by a similar loss or gain
amount on the underlying fair value of debt. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was $2.6
million at December 31, 2004 and is included in investments and
other assets with the corresponding offset in
long-term debt less current maturities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Credit Risk

We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties. We
have risk management and trading contracts with many counterparties, including two counterparties
for which a worst case exposure represents approximately 35% of Pinnacle West’s $391 million of
risk management and trading assets as of December 31, 2004. Our risk management process assesses
and monitors the financial exposure of these and all other counterparties. Despite the fact that
the great majority of trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the credit rating
agencies, including the counterparties noted above, there is still a possibility that one or more
of these companies could default, resulting in a material impact on consolidated earnings for a
given period. Counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of major energy companies,
municipalities, local distribution companies and financial institutions. We maintain credit
policies that we believe minimize overall credit risk to within acceptable limits. Determination
of the credit quality of our counterparties is based upon a number of factors, including credit
ratings and our evaluation of their financial condition. In many contracts, we employ collateral
requirements and standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative
exposures associated with a single counterparty. Valuation adjustments are established
representing our estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to counterparties. See Note 1
“Derivative” for a discussion of our credit valuation adjustment policy.

As defined by the FERC, includes below-the-line non-operating utility costs (primarily
community relations).

(d)

Primarily related to El Dorado’s investment losses in NAC prior to consolidation in the third

20. Variable Interest Entities

In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate VIE lessors in order to sell and
lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2. The leases are accounted for as operating leases in
accordance with GAAP. See Note 9 for further information about the sale leaseback transactions.
We are not the primary beneficiary of the Palo Verde VIEs and, accordingly, do not consolidate
them.

APS is exposed to losses under the Palo Verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of
certain events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur. Under certain
circumstances (for example, the NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde
or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to assume the debt associated
with the transactions, make specified payments to the equity participants, and take title to the
leased Unit 2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written down in value. If
such an event had occurred as of December 31, 2004, APS would have been required to assume
approximately $250 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately $192 million.

In the first quarter of 2004, we adopted FIN No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” for all non-SPE contractual arrangements. SunCor has certain land development
arrangements that are required to be consolidated under FIN
No. 46R. The assets and non-controlling



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

interests reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these arrangements were
approximately $34 million at December 31, 2004.

21. Guarantees

We have issued parental guarantees and letters of credit and obtained surety bonds on behalf
of our unregulated subsidiaries. Our parental guarantees related to Pinnacle West Energy consist
of equipment and performance guarantees related to our generation construction program, and
long-term service agreement guarantees for new power plants. Our credit support instruments enable
APS Energy Services to offer commodity energy and energy-related products. Non-performance or
payment under the original contract by our unregulated subsidiaries would require us to perform
under the guarantee or surety bond. No liability is currently recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets related to Pinnacle West’s guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries. Our guarantees have no
recourse or collateral provisions to allow us to recover amounts paid under the guarantee. The
amounts and approximate terms of our guarantees and surety bonds for each subsidiary at December
31, 2004 are as follows (dollars in millions):

At December 31, 2004, we had entered into approximately $39 million of letters of credit which
support various transmission and construction agreements. These letters of credit expire in 2005
and 2006. We intend to provide from either existing or new facilities for the extension, renewal
or substitution of the letters of credit to the extent required. At December 31, 2004, Pinnacle
West has approximately $3 million of letters of credit related to workers’ compensation expiring in
2006.

APS has entered into various agreements that require letters of credit for financial assurance
purposes. At December 31, 2004, approximately $200 million of letters of credit were outstanding
to support existing pollution control bonds of approximately $200 million. The letters of credit
are available to fund the payment of principal and interest of such debt obligations. In July
2004, $150 million of these letters of credit were renewed for a three-year term and expire in
2007. The remainder expire in 2005. APS has also entered into approximately $102 million of
letters of credit to support certain equity lessors in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions
(see Note 9 for further details on the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions). These letters of
credit expire in 2005. Additionally, APS has approximately $5 million of letters of credit related
to counterparty collateral requirements expiring in 2006. APS intends to provide from either
existing or new facilities for the extension, renewal or substitution of the letters of credit to
the extent required.

We provide indemnifications relating to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our
agreements. APS has provided indemnifications to the equity participants and other parties in the
Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions with respect to certain tax matters. Generally, a maximum
obligation is not explicitly stated in the indemnification and therefore, the overall maximum
amount of the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Based on
historical



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

experience and evaluation of the specific indemnities, we do not believe that any material loss
related to such indemnifications is likely.

22. Discontinued Operations

operations (after income taxes) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in

SunCor

Certain components of SunCor’s real estate sales activities, which are included in the real
estate segment, are required to be reported as discontinued operations on Pinnacle West’s
Consolidated Statements of Income in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Among other guidance, SFAS No. 144 prescribes accounting for
discontinued operations and defines certain activities as discontinued operations.

In the second quarter of 2002, SunCor sold a retail center, but maintained a continuing
involvement through a management contract. In the first quarter of 2003, this management contract
was canceled. As a result, the after-tax gain of $6 million ($10 million pre-tax) recorded in
operations in 2002 related to this property was reclassified as discontinued operations on our
Consolidated Statements of Income. The income from discontinued operations in the year ended
December 31, 2002 primarily reflects this sale.

In 2003, SunCor sold its water utility company, which resulted in an after-tax gain of $8
million ($14 million pretax). The amounts of the gain on the sale and operating income of the
water utility company in 2003 and 2002 are classified as discontinued operations on Pinnacle West’s
Consolidated Statements of Income.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, SunCor sold a retail center, which resulted in an after-tax
gain of $2 million ($3 million pretax). The gain on the sale and the operating income related to
this property in 2003 are classified as discontinued operations on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated
Statements of Income. There were no prior-year operations related to this retail center.

In 2004, SunCor sold commercial property, which resulted in an after-tax gain of $1 million
($2 million pretax). The gain on the sale and the operating income related to this property in
2004 are classified as discontinued operations on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of
Income. There were no prior-year operations related to this property.

The following table provides SunCor’s revenue and income before income taxes (including the
gains on disposals as noted above) related to properties classified as discontinued operations on

In July 2004, we entered into an agreement to sell our investment in NAC. The transaction

quarter of 2002. All related revenues and expenses for NAC have been reclassified to discontinued
operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated
Statements of Income.

Percentage-of-Completion – NAC

Certain NAC contract revenues are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method.
Revenues are recognized based upon total costs incurred to date compared to total costs expected to
be incurred for each contract. Revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in
the accounting period when known. Provisions are made for the full amounts of anticipated losses
in the periods in which they are first determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and
estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final
contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income, and are recognized in the period
in which revisions are determined. Profit incentives are included in revenues when their
realization is reasonably assured.

Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to
contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs.
General and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred.



Assets and Liabilities Related to Discontinued Operations

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

(ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY)

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13(a)-15(f). Management conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework,

our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
which is included herein and relates also to the Company’s
financial statements.

March 15, 2005



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Arizona Public Service Company

Phoenix, Arizona

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Arizona Public Service Company (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of income, changes in common stock
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. We also have
audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial
statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule, an opinion on management’s assessment, and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Furthermore, in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

SUPPLEMENTAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

S-1. Summary of Significant Accounting Polices

Stock-Based Compensation

Pinnacle West offers stock-based compensation plans for officers and key employees of APS. In
2002, APS began applying the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation, as
provided for in SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” The fair value method of
accounting is the preferred method. In accordance with the transition requirements of SFAS No.
123, APS applied the fair value method prospectively, beginning with 2002 stock grants. In prior
years, APS recognized stock compensation expense based on the intrinsic value method allowed in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”

The following chart compares APS’ net income and stock compensation expense to what those
items would have been if APS had recorded stock compensation expense based on the fair value method
for all stock grants through 2004 (dollars in thousands):

S-2. Income Taxes

APS is included in our consolidated tax return. However, when we allocate income taxes to
APS, we do so based on APS’ taxable income or loss alone.

As a result of a change in IRS guidance, we claimed a tax
deduction related to an APS tax accounting method change on the 2001 federal consolidated income
tax return. The accelerated deduction resulted in a $200 million reduction in the current income
tax liability and a corresponding increase in the plant-related deferred tax liability. In 2002,
we received an income tax refund of approximately $115 million related to our 2001 federal
consolidated income tax return. The 2001 federal consolidated income tax return is currently under
examination by the IRS. As part of this ongoing examination, the IRS is reviewing this accounting
method change and the resultant deduction. During 2004, the current income tax liability was
increased, with a corresponding decrease to plant-related deferred tax liability, to reflect the
expected outcome of this audit. We do not expect the ultimate outcome of this examination to have
a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The income tax liability accounts reflect the tax and interest associated with the most
probable resolution of all known and measurable tax exposures.

S-7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

APS believes that the carrying amounts of its cash equivalents are reasonable estimates of
their fair values at December 31, 2004 and 2003 due to their short maturities.

We hold investments in debt securities for purposes other than trading. We believe that the
carrying amounts of these investments represent reasonable estimates of their fair values at December 31,
2004 and 2003 due to the short-term reset of interest rates.

APS holds investments in fixed income and domestic equity securities for purposes other than
trading. The December 31, 2004 and 2003 fair values of such investments, which APS determines by
using quoted market prices, approximate their carrying amount. For further information, see
disclosure of cost and fair value of APS’ nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets in Note 12.

On December 31, 2004, the carrying value of APS’ long-term debt (excluding capitalized lease
obligations) was $2.71 billion, with an estimated fair value of $2.81 billion. The carrying value
of APS’ long-term debt (excluding capital lease obligations) was $2.61 billion on December 31,



ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

SUPPLEMENTAL NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2003, with an estimated fair value of $2.74 billion. The fair value estimates are based on
quoted market prices of the same or similar issues.

S-8. Derivative and Energy Trading Accounting

APS is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances. As part of its overall risk
management program, APS uses various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives to hedge
purchases and sales of electricity, fuels and emissions allowances and credits. As of December 31,
2004, APS hedged exposures to these risks for a maximum of three years.

Cash Flow Hedges

The changes in the fair value of APS’ hedged positions included in the APS Statements of
Income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are comprised of the following (dollars in
thousands):




Gains/(losses) on the ineffective

Gains/(losses) from the change in options
time value excluded from measurement
of effectiveness



(609

)

Gains/(losses) from the discontinuance of
cash flow hedges


—

(9,206

)

During the twelve months ending December 31, 2005, APS estimates that a net gain of $23
million before income taxes will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an
offset to the effect on earnings of market price changes for the related hedged transactions.

APS’ assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities are presented in two
categories:

•

Regulated Electricity – non-trading derivative instruments that hedge APS’ purchases
and sales of electricity and fuel for its Native Load requirements; and

•

Marketing and Trading – both non-trading and trading derivative instruments.

The following table summarizes APS’ assets and liabilities from risk management and trading
activities at December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in thousands):

ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term “disclosure controls and procedures” means controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the “Exchange Act”) (15 U.S.C. 78a

et seq

.) is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management, including its principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Pinnacle West’s management, with the participation of Pinnacle West’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of Pinnacle West’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2004. Based on that evaluation, Pinnacle West’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of that date, Pinnacle West’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

APS’ management, with the participation of APS’ Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of APS’ disclosure controls and procedures as of December

accordance with GAAP.

Equity Compensation Plans Approved By Security Holders

The Company has four equity compensation plans that were approved by its shareholders: the
Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Stock Option and Incentive Plan, under which no new options may
be granted; the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Directors Stock Option Plan, under which no new
options may be granted; the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan, under
which no stock awards may be granted; and the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2002 Long-Term
Incentive Plan. See Note 16 for additional information regarding these plans.

Equity Compensation Plans Not Approved By Security Holders

The Company has one equity compensation plan, the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2000
Director Equity Plan (the “2000 Plan”), for which the approval of shareholders was not required.

Number of Shares Subject to the 2000 Plan

. The total number of shares of the
Company’s common stock granted under the 2000 Plan may not exceed 200,000. In the case of a
significant corporate event, such as a reorganization, merger or consolidation, the 2000 Plan
provides for adjustment of the above limit, the number of shares to be awarded automatically to
eligible non-employee directors and the number of shares of the Company’s common stock non-employee
directors are required to own to receive an annual grant of common stock under the 2000 Plan.

Eligibility for Participation

. Only non-employee directors may participate in the
2000 Plan. A non-employee director is an individual who is a director of the Company but who is
not also an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Terms of Awards

. The 2000 Plan provides for: (1) annual grants of common stock to
eligible non-employee directors, (2) discretionary grants of common stock to eligible non-employee
directors and (3) grants of nonqualified stock options to eligible non-employee directors.



Annual Grants of Stock

Each individual who is a non-employee director as of July 1 of a calendar year, and who meets
requirements of ownership of the Company’s common stock set forth below, will receive 900 shares of
the Company’s common stock for such calendar year. In the first calendar year in which a
non-employee director is eligible to participate in the 2000 Plan, he or she must own at least 900
shares of the Company’s common stock as of December 31 of the same calendar year to receive a grant
of 900 shares of the Company’s common stock. If the non-employee director owns 900 shares of
common stock as of June 30, he or she will receive a grant of 900 shares of common stock as of July
1 of the same calendar year. If the non-employee director does not own 900 shares of the Company’s
common stock as of June 30, but acquires the necessary shares on or before December 31 of the same
year, he or she will receive a grant of 900 shares of common stock within a reasonable time after
the Company verifies that the requisite number of shares has been acquired. In each subsequent
year, the number of shares of the Company’s common stock the non-employee director must own to
receive a grant of 900 shares of common stock will increase by 900 shares, until reaching a maximum
of 4,500 shares. In each of the subsequent years, the non-employee director must own the requisite
number of shares of the Company’s common stock as of June 30 of the relevant calendar year.

Discretionary Grants of Stock

The Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors administers the 2000 Plan and may
grant shares of the Company’s common stock to non-employee directors in its discretion. No
discretionary grants of common stock have been made under the 2000 Plan.

Grants of Non-qualified Stock Options

The Committee can grant non-qualified stock options under the 2000 Plan. The terms and the
conditions of the option grant, including the exercise price per share, which may not be less than
fair market value on the date of grant, will be set by the Committee in a written award agreement.
The Committee will determine the time or times at which any such options may be exercised in whole
or in part. The Committee will also determine the performance or other conditions, if any, that
must be satisfied before all or part of an option may be exercised. Any such options granted to a
participant will expire on the tenth anniversary date of the date of grant, unless the option is
earlier terminated, forfeited or surrendered pursuant to a provision of the 2000 Plan or the
applicable award agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a participant ceases to be a Company
director for any reason, including death or disability, any such options held by that participant
will expire on the second anniversary of the date on which the participant ceased to be a Company
director, unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement. Unless the Committee
provides otherwise, no such options may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise
alienated, other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution, or under any other
circumstances allowed by the Committee. No options have been granted under the 2000 Plan.
