PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Pinnacle West

Pinnacle West is a holding company that conducts business through its subsidiaries. We derive
substantially all of our revenues and earnings from our wholly-owned subsidiary, APS. APS is a
vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to
most of the State of Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix
metropolitan area, the Tucson metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona.

Pinnacle West’s other first-tier subsidiaries are SunCor, APSES and El Dorado. Additional
information related to these businesses is provided later in this report.

Our reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which consists of
traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electric service to
Native Load customers) and related activities, and includes electricity generation, transmission
and distribution. In 2009 our real-estate subsidiary, SunCor, began disposing of its homebuilding
operations, master-planned communities, land parcels, commercial assets and golf courses in order
to reduce its outstanding debt (see Note 23). All of SunCor’s operations are reflected as
discontinued operations. As a result, the real estate segment is no longer a reportable segment.
See Note 17 for financial information of our business segments.

BUSINESS OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

APS currently provides electric service to approximately 1.1 million customers. We own or
lease more than 6,290 MW of regulated generation capacity and we hold a mix of both long-term and
short-term purchased power agreements for additional capacity, including a variety of agreements
for the purchase of renewable energy. During 2010, no single purchaser or user of energy accounted
for more than 1.2% of our electric revenues.



The following map shows APS’s retail service territory, including the locations of its
generating facilities and principal transmission lines.



Energy Sources and Resource Planning

To serve its customers, APS obtains power through its various generation stations and through
purchased power agreements. Resource planning is an important function necessary to meet Arizona’s
future energy needs. APS’s sources of energy by fuel type during 2010 were as follows:

Generation Facilities

APS has ownership interests in or leases the coal, nuclear, gas, oil and solar
generating facilities described below. For additional information regarding these facilities, see
Item 2.

Coal Fueled Generating Facilities

Four Corners

— Four Corners is a 5-unit coal-fired power plant located in the northwestern
corner of New Mexico. APS operates the plant and owns 100% of Four Corners Units 1, 2 and 3 and
15% of Units 4 and 5. APS has a total entitlement from Four Corners of 791 MW. The Four Corners
plant site is leased from the Navajo Nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal
government. APS purchases all of Four Corners’ coal requirements from a supplier with a long-term
lease of coal reserves with the Navajo Nation. The Four Corners coal contract runs through 2016.

On November 8, 2010, APS and Southern California Edison (“SCE”) entered into an asset purchase
agreement providing for the purchase by APS of SCE’s 48% interest in each of Units 4 and 5 of Four
Corners. If consummated, APS would acquire 739 MW from SCE unless any of the other owners of
interests in Units 4 and 5 exercise their rights of first refusal prior to March 8, 2011, in which
case APS would not be able to purchase SCE’s entire share of the Units. Completion of the purchase
by APS, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2012, is conditioned upon the receipt of
regulatory approvals from the ACC, the California Public Utilities Commission and the FERC, the
execution of a new coal supply contract for a lease renewal period described below, expiration of
the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other typical closing
conditions.



APS, on behalf of the Four Corners participants, has negotiated amendments to an existing
facility lease with the Navajo Nation which would extend the Four Corners leasehold interest to
2041. Execution by the Navajo Nation of the lease amendments is a condition to closing of the
purchase by APS of SCE’s interests in Four Corners. The execution of these amendments by the Navajo
Nation requires the approval of the Navajo Nation Council, which
occurred on February 15, 2011 and is awaiting final signature by the
Nation’s President. The effectiveness of the amendments also
requires the approval of the U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”), as does a related Federal
rights-of-way grant which the Four Corners participants will pursue. A Federal environmental
review will be conducted as part of the DOI review process.

APS has announced that, if APS’s purchase of SCE’s interests in Units 4 and 5 at Four Corners
is consummated, it will close Units 1, 2 and 3 at the plant. These events will change the plant’s
overall generating capacity from 2,100 MW to 1,540 MW and APS’s entitlement from the plant from 791
MW to 970 MW.

Cholla

— Cholla is a 4-unit coal-fired power plant located in northeastern Arizona. APS
operates the plant and owns 100% of Cholla Units 1, 2 and 3. PacifiCorp owns Cholla Unit 4, and
APS operates that Unit for PacifiCorp. APS has a total entitlement from Cholla of 647 MW. APS
purchases all of Cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines all of the coal under
long-term leases of coal reserves with the federal government and private landholders. The Cholla
coal contract runs through 2024. APS has the ability under the contract to reduce its annual coal
commitment and purchase a portion of Cholla’s coal requirements on the spot market to take
advantage of competitive pricing options and to purchase coal required for increased operating
capacity. APS believes that the current fuel contracts and competitive fuel supply options ensure
the continued operation of Cholla for its useful life. In addition, APS has a long-term coal
transportation contract.

Navajo Generating Station

— The Navajo Plant is a 3-unit coal-fired power plant located in
northern Arizona. Salt River Project operates the plant and APS owns a 14% interest in Navajo
Units 1, 2 and 3. APS has a total entitlement from the Navajo Plant of 315 MW. The Navajo Plant’s
coal requirements are purchased from a supplier with long-term leases from the Navajo Nation and
the Hopi Tribe. The Navajo Plant is under contract with its coal supplier through 2011, with
options to extend through 2019. The Navajo Plant site is leased from the Navajo Nation and is also
subject to an easement from the federal government.

These coal plants face uncertainties related to existing and potential legislation and
regulation that could significantly impact their economics and operations. See “Environmental
Matters” below and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Overview and Capital Expenditures” in Item 7 for environmental and climate change
developments and lease renewal negotiations with the Navajo Nation impacting these coal facilities.
See Note 11 for information regarding APS’s coal mine reclamation obligations.

Nuclear

Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station —

Palo Verde is a nuclear power plant located about 50
miles west of Phoenix, Arizona. APS operates the plant and owns 29.1% of Palo Verde Units 1 and 3
and about 17% of Unit 2. In addition, APS leases about 12.1% of Unit 2, resulting in a 29.1%
combined interest in that Unit. APS has a total entitlement from Palo Verde of 1,146 MW.



Palo Verde Leases —

In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust
entities in order to sell and lease back about 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain
common facilities. Prior to 2010, APS accounted for these arrangements as operating leases. Due
to amended VIE accounting guidance, in 2010 APS began consolidating the lessor trust entities, and
eliminated lease accounting for these transactions. The agreements have terms of 29.5 years and
contain options to renew the leases or to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of
the lease terms. APS must give notice to the respective lessor trusts between December 31, 2010
and December 31, 2012 if it wishes to exercise, or not exercise, either of these options. We are
analyzing these options. See Note 20 for additional information regarding the Palo Verde Unit 2
sale leaseback transactions.

Palo Verde Operating Licenses

—

Operation of each of the three Palo Verde Units requires an
operating license from the NRC. The NRC issued full power operating licenses for Unit 1 in June
1985, Unit 2 in April 1986 and Unit 3 in November 1987. The full power operating licenses, each
valid for a period of 40 years, authorize APS, as operating agent for Palo Verde, to operate the
three Palo Verde Units. On December 15, 2008, APS applied for renewed operating licenses for the
Palo Verde Units for a period of 20 years beyond the expirations of the current licenses. The
current NRC schedule for the applications estimates that a final NRC decision will be issued in
April 2011. APS is making preparations to secure resources necessary to operate the plant for the
period of extended operation, including the execution in April 2010 of a Municipal Effluent
Purchase and Sale Agreement that provides effluent water rights necessary for cooling purposes at
Palo Verde through 2050.

Palo Verde Fuel Cycle —

The fuel cycle for Palo Verde is comprised of the following stages:

•

mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates;

•

conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride;

•

enrichment of uranium hexafluoride;

•

fabrication of fuel assemblies;

•

utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors; and

•

storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.

The Palo Verde participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource
needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs. The Palo Verde participants have
contracted for all of Palo Verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2011 and 95% of
its requirements through 2017. A new contract is currently being negotiated that will cover Palo
Verde’s remaining requirements for uranium concentrates through 2017. The participants have also
contracted for all of Palo Verde’s conversion services through 2018, all of Palo Verde’s enrichment
services through 2020 and all of Palo Verde’s fuel assembly fabrication services through 2016.

Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal —

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (“NWPA”)
required the DOE to accept, transport, and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste
generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998. The DOE’s obligations are reflected in a
Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (“Standard
Contract”) with each nuclear power plant. The DOE failed to begin accepting Palo Verde’s spent
nuclear fuel by 1998, and APS (on behalf of itself and the other Palo Verde participants) filed a
lawsuit for DOE’s breach of the Palo Verde Standard Contract in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.
The Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of APS and in October 2010 awarded $30.2 million in
damages to the Palo Verde participants for costs incurred through December 2006.



The DOE had planned to meet its NWPA and Standard Contract disposal obligations by designing,
licensing, constructing, and operating a permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.
In June 2008, DOE submitted its application to the NRC to authorize construction of the Yucca
Mountain repository. In March 2010, the DOE filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice its Yucca
Mountain construction authorization application that was pending before the NRC. Several
interested parties have intervened in the NRC proceeding, and the proceeding has not been
conclusively decided by the NRC or the courts. Additionally, a number of interested parties have
filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the DOE’s
authority to withdraw the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. None of these
lawsuits have been conclusively decided by the courts.

Palo Verde has sufficient capacity at its on-site independent spent fuel storage installation
(“ISFSI”) to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating
license period, which ends in December 2027. Additionally, Palo Verde has sufficient capacity at
its on-site ISFSI to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of
extended operation, which ends in December 2047 (assuming the NRC approves APS’s request for
renewed operating licenses, as discussed above). If uncertainties regarding the United States
government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved, APS will
evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the ISFSI to accommodate
all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation.

In addition to the spent fuel stored at Palo Verde’s on-site ISFSI, Palo Verde also generates
certain types of low level radioactive waste that are stored on-site. Currently, the Class B and
Class C waste (the higher radioactivity of the low level wastes) is stored on-site since industry
access to a disposal site was eliminated several years ago. The NRC is considering regulations
that would allow the industry to eliminate much of this waste by blending it with lower level Class
A waste so that it can be disposed of at a facility such as the one Palo Verde utilizes in Utah.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

—

APS currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to
meet the NRC financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in Palo Verde Units
1, 2 and 3. The decommissioning costs of Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3 are currently included in
APS’s ACC jurisdictional rates. Decommissioning costs are recoverable through a non-bypassable
system benefits charge (one paid by all retail customers taking service from the APS system), which
allows APS to maintain its external sinking fund mechanism. See Note 12 for additional information
about APS’s nuclear decommissioning costs.

Palo Verde Liability and Insurance Matters

— See “Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station —
Nuclear Insurance” in Note 11 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the Palo Verde
participants, including APS, for Palo Verde.

Natural Gas and Oil Fueled Generating Facilities

APS has six natural gas power plants located throughout Arizona, consisting of Redhawk,
located near the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station; Ocotillo, located in Tempe; Sundance,
located in Coolidge; West Phoenix, located in southwest Phoenix; Saguaro, located north of Tucson;
and Yucca, located near Yuma. Several of the units at Saguaro and Yucca run on either gas or oil.
APS has one oil only power plant, Douglas, located in the town of Douglas, Arizona. APS owns and
operates each of these plants with the exception of one combustion turbine unit and one steam unit
at Yucca that are operated by APS and owned by the Imperial Irrigation District. APS has a total
entitlement from these plants of 3,389 MW. Gas for these plants is acquired through APS’s
hedging program. APS has long-term gas transportation agreements with three different companies,
some of which are effective through 2024. Fuel oil is acquired under short-term purchases
delivered primarily to West Phoenix, where it is distributed to APS’s other oil power plants by
truck.



Solar Facilities

APS owns and operates more than sixty small solar systems around the state. Together they
have the capacity to produce about 5 MW of renewable energy. This fleet of solar systems includes
a 3 MW facility located at the Prescott Airport, a 1 MW facility located at APS’s Saguaro power
plant and less than 1 MW of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the
Community Power Project in Flagstaff, Arizona. The Community Power Project, approved by the ACC on
April 1, 2010, is a pilot program through which, upon completion, APS will own, operate and receive
energy from approximately 1.5 MW of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a
certain test area in Flagstaff, Arizona.

Purchased Power Contracts

In addition to its own available generating capacity, APS purchases electricity under various
arrangements, including long-term contracts and purchases through short-term markets to supplement
its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements. A substantial portion of APS’s
purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
(See Note 18.) APS continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure
system reliability. APS does not expect to require new conventional generation sources sooner than
2017, due primarily to planned additions of renewable resources and energy efficiency initiatives.

Purchased Power Capacity —

APS’s purchased power capacity under long-term contracts,
including its renewable energy portfolio, is summarized in the tables below. All capacity values

(a)

The capacity under this agreement varies by month, with a maximum capacity of 104 MW.

(b)

Up to 60 MW of capacity is available; however, the amount of electricity available to APS
under this agreement is based in large part on customer demand and is adjusted annually.



(c)

This is a seasonal capacity exchange agreement under which APS receives electricity during
the summer peak season (from May 15 to September 15) and APS returns a like amount of
electricity during the winter season (from October 15 to February 15).

(d)

The capacity under this agreement increases in phases over the first three years to reach the
100 MW level by the summer of 2012.

(e)

Renewable energy purchased power agreements are described in detail below under “Current and
Future Resources — Renewable Energy Standard — Renewable Energy Portfolio.”

Current and Future Resources

Current Demand and Reserve Margin

Electric power demand is generally seasonal. In Arizona, demand for power peaks during the
hot summer months. APS’s 2010 peak one-hour demand on its electric system was recorded on July 15,
2010 at 6,936 MW, compared to the 2009 peak of 7,218 MW recorded on July 27, 2009. APS’s operable
generating capacity, together with firm purchases totaling 2,974 MW, including short-term seasonal
purchases and unit contingent purchases, resulted in an actual reserve margin, at the time of the
2010 peak demand, of 21.8%. The power actually available to APS from its resources fluctuates from
time to time due in part to planned and unplanned plant and transmission outages.

Future Resources and Resource Plan

Under the ACC’s modified resource planning rule, APS will file by April 1

st

of each
even year its resource plans for the next fifteen-year period. The ACC’s modified rule also
requires APS to file its first resource plan within 120 days after the rule becomes effective. The
modified rule became effective in January 2011 and APS will likely file a resource plan in the
first quarter of 2011. The modified rule also requires the ACC to issue an order with its
acknowledgment of APS’s resource plan within approximately ten months following its submittal. The
ACC’s acknowledgment of APS’s resource plan will consider factors such as the total cost of
electric energy services, demand management, analysis of supply-side options, system reliability
and risk management.



Renewable Energy Standard

In 2006, the ACC adopted the RES. Under the RES, electric utilities that are regulated by the
ACC must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible
renewable resources, including solar, wind, biomass, biogas and geothermal technologies. The
renewable energy requirement is 3% of retail electric sales in 2011 and increases annually until it
reaches 15% in 2025. In APS’s 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement, APS committed to have
1,700 GWh of new renewable resources in service by year-end 2015 in addition to its 2008 renewable
resource commitments. Taken together, APS’s commitment is estimated to be 3,400 GWh, or
approximately 10% of retail sales, by year-end 2015, which is double the existing RES target of 5%
for that year. (See Note 3.) A component of the RES is focused on stimulating development of
distributed energy systems (generally speaking, small-scale renewable technologies that are located
on customers’ properties). Accordingly, under the RES, an increasing percentage of that
requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources. This distributed energy
requirement is 25% of the overall RES requirement of 3% in 2011 and increases to 30% of the
applicable RES requirement in 2012 and subsequent years. The following table summarizes these
requirement standards and their timing:

Renewable Energy Portfolio.

APS has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable
resources totaling 875 MW, including wind, geothermal, solar, biomass and biogas. Of this
portfolio, 288 MW are currently in operation and 587 MW are under contract for development or are
under construction. Renewable resources in operation include 5 MW of facilities owned by APS, 223
MW of long-term purchased power agreements, and an estimated 60 MW of customer-sited, third-party
owned distributed energy resources.

APS continues to actively consider opportunities to enhance its renewable energy portfolio,
both to ensure its compliance with the RES and to meet the needs of its customer base. APS’s
strategy to achieve its RES requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new
facilities, ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities
to be owned by APS. One of the key programs under which APS will own solar resources is the “AZ
Sun Program.” As approved by the ACC, the AZ Sun Program will allow APS to own 100 MW of solar
photovoltaic power plants across Arizona by investing up to $500 million through 2014. Under this
program to date, APS has executed contracts for the development of 83 MW of new solar generation,
representing an investment commitment of approximately $377 million. See Note 3 for additional
details about the AZ Sun Program, including the related cost recovery.

The following table summarizes APS’s renewable energy sources in operation and under
development. Agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to
various conditions, including successful siting, permitting and interconnection of the projects to
the electric grid.

Demand Side Management

Arizona regulators are placing an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side
management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy, while incentivizing utilities to aid
in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy. In December 2009, the ACC initiated
Energy Efficiency rulemaking, with a proposed Energy Efficiency Standard of 22% cumulative annual
energy savings by 2020. This standard was adopted and became effective on January 1, 2011. This
ambitious standard will likely impact Arizona’s future energy resource needs. (See Note 3 for
energy efficiency and other demand side management obligations resulting from APS’s 2009 retail
rate case settlement.)

Economic Stimulus Projects

Through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”), the Federal government
made a number of programs available for utilities to develop renewable resources, improve
reliability and create jobs by using economic stimulus funding. Certain programs are also
available through the State of Arizona.

In 2009, the DOE announced an ARRA commitment to fund the majority of a carbon dioxide
emission reduction research and development project in the amount of $71 million, which was to be
located at our Cholla power plant. Due to the increased resource and funding requirements for a
project of that size, APS elected not to move forward with that award and is now in the process of
closing out the project. However, APS is moving forward with work under the $3 million award from
DOE for a high penetration photovoltaic generation study related to the Community Power Project in
Flagstaff, Arizona. The funding under this DOE award will continue to be contingent upon meeting
certain project milestones, including DOE-established budget parameters, over the next four years.

APS is also continuing its work as a sub-recipient under an ARRA award received through the
State of Arizona’s Department of Commerce. This approximately $4 million award is for the
implementation of various distributed energy and energy efficiency programs in Arizona. APS will
be implementing certain solar water heater and photovoltaic-related community projects under this
award.

Competitive Environment and Regulatory Oversight

Retail

The ACC regulates APS’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities. The ACC must
also approve any transfer or encumbrance of APS’s property used to provide retail electric service
and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between Pinnacle West, APS and
their respective affiliates.



APS is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investor-owned electric and gas
utilities in Arizona (such as Southwest Gas Corporation), as well as cooperatives, municipalities,
electrical districts and similar types of governmental or non-profit organizations. In addition,
some customers, particularly industrial and large commercial customers, may own and operate
generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements. This practice is
becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as roof top solar
panels to meet or supplement their energy needs.

In 1999, the ACC approved rules for the introduction of retail electric
competition in Arizona. As a result, as of January 1, 2001, all of APS’s retail customers were
eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers. However, there are currently no active retail
competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to APS’s customers. In 2000, the
Arizona Superior Court found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects
unlawful, the latter finding being primarily on procedural grounds, and invalidated all ACC orders
authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in Arizona. In 2004, the Arizona
Court of Appeals invalidated some, but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the
orders authorizing competitive electric service providers. In 2005, the Arizona Supreme Court
declined to review the Court of Appeals decision.

To date, the ACC has taken no further or substantive action on either the rules or the prior
orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to the final Court of Appeals
decision. In 2008, the ACC directed the ACC staff to investigate whether such retail competition
was in the public interest and what legal impediments remain to competition in light of the Court
of Appeals decision referenced above. The ACC staff’s report on the results of its investigation
was issued on August 12, 2010. The report stated that additional analysis, discussion and study of
all aspects of the issue are required in order to perform a proper evaluation. While the report
did not make any specific recommendations other than to conduct more workshops, the report did
state that the current retail electric competition rules are incomplete and in need of
modification.

On April 14, 2010, the ACC issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and
operate solar facilities for non-profit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of
contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service
corporations” under the Arizona Constitution, and are therefore not regulated by the ACC. A second
matter is pending with the ACC to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers
who serve a broader customer base under the same business model. Use of such products by customers
within our territory would result in some level of competition. APS cannot predict when, and the
extent to which, additional electric service providers will enter or re-enter APS’s service
territory.



Wholesale

The FERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services. (See Note 3 for
information regarding APS’s transmission rates.) During 2010, approximately 5.8% of APS’s electric
operating revenues resulted from such sales and services. APS’s wholesale activity primarily
consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy
requirements. APS also sells, in the wholesale market, its generation output that is not needed
for APS’s Native Load and, in doing so, competes with other utilities, power marketers and
independent power producers. Additionally, subject to specified parameters, APS markets, hedges
and trades in electricity and fuels.

Environmental Matters

Climate Change

Legislative Initiatives.

In the past several years, the United States Congress has considered
bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions. In 2009, the House of Representatives
passed a comprehensive energy and climate change bill, but the Senate did not consider it or a
similar bill in the 111

th

Congress. With much focus on the economy, it is unclear when
Congress will consider another global warming bill. The actual economic and operational impact of
any legislation on APS depends on a variety of factors, none of which can be fully known until such
legislation passes and the specifics of the resulting program are established. These factors
include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed emissions; whether any permitted
emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned; the cost to
reduce emissions or buy allowances in the marketplace; and the availability of offsets and
mitigating factors to moderate the costs of compliance. At the present time, we cannot predict
what form of legislation, if any, will ultimately pass.

In addition to federal legislative initiatives, state-specific initiatives may also impact our
business. While Arizona has not yet enacted any state-specific legislation regarding greenhouse
gas emissions, the California legislature enacted AB 32 and SB 1368 in 2006 to address greenhouse
gas emissions. In December 2010, the California Air Resources Board approved regulations that will
establish a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas emissions which is scheduled to be launched in
2012 as part of the state’s program implementing AB32. In addition, the New Mexico Environmental
Improvement Board recently enacted a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program and emissions cap, to
become effective in 2012 and 2013, respectively.

We are monitoring these and other state legislative developments to understand the extent to
which they may affect our business, including our sales into the impacted states or the ability of
our out-of-state power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coal-fired
power plants. In particular, SCE, a participant in Four Corners, has indicated that SB 1368 may
prohibit it from making emission control expenditures at the plant. (See “Energy Sources and
Resource Planning — Generation Facilities — Coal Fueled Generating Facilities — Four Corners”
above for details of the pending sale of SCE’s interest in Four Corners to APS.)



Regulatory Initiatives.

In December 2009, the EPA determined that greenhouse gas emissions
endanger public health and welfare. This determination was made in response to a 2007 United
States Supreme Court ruling that greenhouse gases fit within the Clean Air Act’s broad definition
of “air pollutant” and, as a result, the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions
of new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. As a result of the endangerment finding, the EPA
determined that the Clean Air Act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major
greenhouse
gas emitting sources, including power plants. On June 3, 2010, the EPA issued a rule under the
Clean Air Act, known as the “tailoring rule,” establishing new greenhouse gas emissions thresholds
that determine when sources, including power plants, must obtain air operating permits or New
Source Review permits. New Source Review is a pre-construction permitting program under the Clean
Air Act that requires analysis of pollution controls prior to building a new stationary source or
making major modifications to an existing stationary source. The tailoring rule became effective
on August 2, 2010 and it became applicable to power plants on January 2, 2011. Several groups have
filed lawsuits challenging the EPA’s endangerment finding and the tailoring rule.

APS does not expect the tailoring rule to have a significant impact on its current operations.
The rule will require APS to consider the impact of greenhouse gas emissions as part of its
traditional New Source Review analysis for new sources and major modifications to existing plants.
At the present time, we cannot predict what other rules or regulations may ultimately result from
the EPA’s endangerment finding, whether the parties challenging the endangerment finding or the
tailoring rule will be successful, and what impact other potential rules or regulations will have
on APS’s operations.

On December 30, 2010, pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act, the EPA finalized a
greenhouse gas Federal Implementation Plan (“FIP”) for Arizona relating to pre-construction permits
for construction of new sources or major modifications of existing sources. As a result of this
action, effective January 2, 2011, the EPA assumed responsibility for acting on permit applications
for only the greenhouse gas portion of such pre-construction permits. State permitting authorities
will continue to retain responsibility for the remaining parts of pre-construction permits that are
unrelated to emissions of greenhouse gasses. To the extent Arizona seeks and receives from the EPA
a delegation of permitting authority for greenhouse gas emissions, the state will assume
responsibility for issuing both the greenhouse gas and non-greenhouse gas portions of
pre-construction permits. The greenhouse gas FIP will remain in place until such time as the EPA
approves a State Implementation Plan that applies pre-construction permit requirements to
greenhouse gas-emitting stationary sources in Arizona. APS does not expect the greenhouse gas FIP
to have a significant impact on its current operations.

The EPA also recently announced its intent to promulgate New Source Performance Standards
(“NSPS”) for greenhouse gas emissions from certain industrial facilities, under the Clean Air Act.
The EPA intends to propose the new standards by July 2011 and to finalize them by May 2012. The
EPA has indicated that the rules will apply to coal-fired electric generating units (“EGUs”) and
will establish NSPS for new and modified EGUs and emission guidelines for existing EGUs. The rules
are expected to apply to the Four Corners, Cholla and the Navajo Plant. We cannot currently
predict the impact of these rules on APS’s operations.

If any emission reduction legislation or additional regulations are enacted, we will assess
our compliance alternatives, which may include replacement of existing equipment, installation of
additional pollution control equipment, purchase of allowances, retirement or suspension of
operations at certain coal-fired facilities, or other actions. Although associated capital
expenditures or operating costs resulting from greenhouse gas emission regulations or legislation
could be material, we believe that we would be able to recover the costs of these environmental
compliance initiatives through our rates.



Regional Initiative

.

In 2007, six western states (Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oregon,
Utah and Washington) and two Canadian provinces (British Columbia and Manitoba) entered into an
accord, the Western Climate Initiative (“WCI”), to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles
and certain industries, including utilities. Montana, Quebec and Ontario have also joined WCI.
WCI
participants set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 15% below 2005 levels by 2020.
After soliciting public comment, in September 2008 WCI issued the design of a cap-and-trade program
for greenhouse gas emissions. Due in part to the recent activity at the federal level discussed
above, the initiative’s momentum and the movement toward detailed proposed rules has slowed. On
February 2, 2010, Arizona’s Governor issued an executive order stating that Arizona will continue
to be a member of WCI to monitor its advancements in this area, but it will not implement the WCI
regional cap-and-trade program. As a result, while we continue to monitor the progress of WCI, at
the present time we do not believe it will have a material impact on our operations.

Company Response to Climate Change Initiatives

.

We have undertaken a number of initiatives to
address emission concerns, including renewable energy procurement and development, promotion of
programs and rates that promote energy conservation, renewable energy use and energy efficiency.
(See “Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Current and Future Resources” above for details of
these plans and initiatives.) APS currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources,
including wind, geothermal, solar and biomass and we are focused on increasing the percentage of
our energy that is produced by renewable resources.

In January 2008, APS joined the Climate Registry as a Founding Reporter. Founding Reporters
are companies that voluntarily joined the non-profit organization before May 2008 to measure and
report greenhouse gas emissions in a common, accurate and transparent manner consistent across
industry sectors and borders. Beginning in 2010, APS stopped participating in the Climate Registry
because APS began reporting substantially the same information under the mandatory greenhouse gas
reporting rule issued by the EPA on September 22, 2009. Pinnacle
West prepares an annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which
is available on our website

(

www.pinnaclewest.com

)

. The
report provides information related to the Company and its approach to sustainability and its
workplace and environmental performance. The information on Pinnacle West’s website, including the
Corporate Responsibility Report, is not incorporated by reference into this report.

Climate Change Lawsuits.

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of
Kivalina, Alaska filed a lawsuit in federal court in the Northern District of California against
nine oil companies, fourteen power companies (including Pinnacle West), and a coal company,
alleging that the defendants’ emissions of carbon dioxide contribute to global warming and
constitute a public and private nuisance. The plaintiffs also allege that the effects of global
warming will require the relocation of the village and they are seeking an unspecified amount of
monetary damages. In June 2008, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the action, which were
granted. The plaintiffs filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in November 2009,
and Pinnacle West filed its reply on June 30, 2010. The court has not yet scheduled oral
arguments on the plaintiffs’ appeal. We believe the action is without merit and intend to
continue to defend against the claims.

A similar nuisance lawsuit,

American Electric Power Co., Inc. v. Connecticut,

is currently
pending in the United States Supreme Court. Another such lawsuit was dismissed by the Fifth
Circuit on procedural grounds. Both cases, as well as the Kivalina case, raise political and legal
considerations, including whether the courts can or should be making climate change policy
decisions. The outcome of the

American Electric Power

case is
particularly significant because the issues being considered by the
Supreme Court closely overlap with the main issues presented  in the

Kivalina

appeal.   We are not a party to either of these two lawsuits, but are monitoring these
developments and their potential industry impacts.



EPA Environmental Regulation

Regional Haze Rules.

Over a decade ago, the EPA announced regional haze rules to reduce
visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas. The rules require states (or, for
sources located on tribal land, the EPA) to determine what pollution control technologies
constitute the “best available retrofit technology” (“BART”) for certain older major stationary
sources. The EPA subsequently issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule, which provides guidelines on
how to perform a BART analysis.

Cholla.

In 2007, ADEQ required APS to perform a BART analysis for Cholla pursuant to the
Clean Air Visibility Rule. APS completed the BART analysis for Cholla and submitted its BART
recommendations to ADEQ on February 4, 2008. The recommendations include the installation of
certain pollution control equipment that APS believes constitutes BART. ADEQ has reviewed APS’s
recommendations and is expected to submit to EPA Region 9 its proposed BART State Implementation
Plan (“SIP”) for Cholla and other sources within the state in the near future. On January 19,
2011, a group of environmental organizations notified EPA of its intent to sue the agency as a
result of EPA’s alleged failure to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan for states that have
not yet submitted all or part of the required BART SIPs, including Arizona.

Once APS receives a final determination as to what constitutes BART for Cholla, we will have
five years to complete the installation of the equipment and to achieve the emission limits
established by ADEQ. However, in order to coordinate with the plant’s other scheduled activities,
APS is currently implementing portions of its recommended plan for Cholla on a voluntary basis.
Costs related to the implementation of these portions of our recommended plan are included in our
environmental expenditure estimates (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Expenditures” in Item 7).

Four Corners and the Navajo Plant.

EPA Region 9 previously requested that APS, as the
operating agent for Four Corners, and SRP, as the operating agent for the Navajo Plant, perform a
BART analysis for Four Corners and the Navajo Plant, respectively. APS and SRP each submitted an
analysis to the EPA concluding that certain combustion control equipment constitutes BART for these
plants. Based on the analyses and comments received through EPA’s rulemaking process, the EPA will
determine what it believes constitutes BART for each plant.

On October 6, 2010, the EPA issued its proposed BART determination for Four Corners. The
proposed rule would require the installation of post-combustion controls on each of Units 1-5 at
Four Corners to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Current estimates indicate that APS’s total
costs for these controls could be up to approximately $400 million for Four Corners. If APS’s
purchase of SCE’s interest in Units 4 and 5 is consummated and Units 1-3 are closed, APS’s total
costs for these controls would be approximately $300 million. (See “Energy Sources and Resource
Planning — Generation Facilities — Coal Fueled Generating Facilities — Four Corners” for details
of this proposed transaction.) The EPA also indicated in the proposal that it may require the
installation of electrostatic precipitators or baghouses on Units 1, 2 and 3 to reduce particulate
matter emissions. APS estimates that its total costs for such particulate removal equipment is
approximately $220 million, which may also be required under the anticipated mercury rules. (See
“Environmental Matters — Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants” below for additional
information on these anticipated rules.) The EPA proposed a 10% stack opacity limitation for all
five units and a 20% opacity limitation on certain fugitive dust emissions, although the proposed
fugitive dust provision is unrelated to BART.



On November 24, 2010, APS submitted a letter to the EPA proposing an alternative to the EPA’s
October BART proposal. Specifically, APS proposed to close Four Corners Units 1, 2 and 3 by 2014
and to install post-combustion pollution controls for NOx on Units 4 and 5 by the end of 2018,
provided that the EPA agrees to a contemporaneous resolution of Four Corners’ obligations or
liability, if any, under the regional haze and reasonably attributable visibility impairment
programs, the New Source Review program, and NSPS programs of the Clean Air Act.

On February 10, 2011, the EPA signed a Supplemental Notice Requesting Comment, related to the
BART rulemaking for Four Corners. In the Supplemental Notice, the EPA proposed to find that a
different alternative emission control strategy, based upon APS’s November 2010 proposal, would
achieve more progress than the EPA’s October 2010 BART proposal. The Supplemental Notice proposes
that Units 1, 2 and 3 would close by 2014, post-combustion pollution controls for NOx would be
installed on Units 4 and 5 by July 31, 2018, and the NOx emission limitation for Units 4 and 5
would be 0.098 lbs/MMBtu, rather than the 0.11 lbs/MMBtu proposed by the EPA in October 2010. The
EPA extended the comment deadline for both the October 2010 proposal and the Supplemental Notice to
May 2, 2011. We are currently evaluating both proposals and will be providing comments to the EPA
on both.

The EPA has not yet issued a proposed rule for the Navajo Plant. SRP’s recommended plan for
the Navajo Plant includes the installation of combustion control equipment, with an estimated cost
to APS of approximately $6 million based on APS’s Navajo Plant ownership interest. If the EPA
determines that post-combustion controls are required, APS’s total costs could be up to
approximately $93 million for the Navajo Plant. The Four Corners and the Navajo Plant participants
will have five years after the EPA issues its final determinations to achieve compliance with their
respective BART requirements.

In addition, on February 16, 2010, a group of environmental organizations filed a petition
with the Departments of Interior and Agriculture requesting those agencies to certify to the EPA
that visibility impairment in sixteen national park and wilderness areas is reasonably attributable
to emissions from Four Corners, the Navajo Plant and other non-APS plants. If the agencies certify
impairment, the EPA is required to evaluate and, if necessary, determine BART for Four Corners and
the Navajo Plant under a different haze program known as “Reasonably Attributable Visibility
Impairment.” On January 19, 2011, a similar group of environmental organizations filed a lawsuit
against the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, alleging among other things that the agencies
failed to act on the February 2010 petition “without unreasonable delay” and requesting the court
to order the agencies to act on the petition within 30 days. We are currently evaluating the
potential impact of this lawsuit on APS.

The Four Corners and Navajo Plant participants’ obligations to comply with the EPA’s final
BART determinations, coupled with the financial impact of future climate change legislation, other
environmental regulations, the result of the lawsuit mentioned above and other business
considerations, could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of
individual participants to continue their participation in these plants.

In order to coordinate with each plant’s other scheduled activities, the plants are currently
implementing portions of their recommended plans described above on a voluntary basis. APS’s share
of the costs related to the implementation of these portions of the recommended plans are included
in our environmental expenditure estimates (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Expenditures” in Item 7).



Mercury and other Hazardous Air Pollutants.

In early 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
D.C. Circuit vacated the Clean Air Mercury Rule (“CAMR”), which was adopted by the EPA to regulate
mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. As a result, the law in effect prior to the
adoption of the CAMR became the applicable law, and the EPA is now required to adopt final maximum
achievable control technology emissions (“MACT”) standards. Under a consent decree that was
finalized on April 15, 2010, the EPA has agreed to issue final MACT standards for mercury and other
hazardous air pollutants by November 2011. Under the terms of the consent decree, APS will have
three years after the EPA issues its final rule to achieve compliance, which would likely require
APS to install additional pollution control equipment.

APS has installed, and continues to install, certain of the equipment necessary to meet the
anticipated standards. APS estimates that the cost for equipment necessary to meet these
anticipated standards is approximately $220 million for Four Corners Units 1-3 and $89 million for
Cholla Units 1-3. The estimated costs for Four Corners Units 1-3 are not included in our current
environmental expenditure estimates since our estimates assume the consummation of APS’s purchase
of SCE’s interest in Four Corners Units 4 and 5 and the subsequent shut down of Units 1-3.
Cholla’s estimated costs for the next three years are included in our environmental expenditure
estimates. (See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Capital Expenditures” in Item 7 for details of our capital expenditure estimates).

Coal Combustion Waste.

On June 21, 2010, the EPA released its proposed regulations governing
the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals (“CCRs”), such as fly ash and bottom ash.
APS currently disposes of CCRs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at Cholla and Four Corners, and
also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete production.
The EPA proposes regulating CCRs as either non-hazardous waste or hazardous waste and requested
comments on three different alternatives. The hazardous waste proposal would phase out the use of
ash ponds for disposal of CCRs. The other two proposals regulate CCRs as non-hazardous waste and
impose performance standards for ash disposal. One of these proposals would require retrofitting or
closure of currently unlined ash ponds, while the other proposal would not require the installation
of liners or pond closures. The EPA has not yet indicated a preference for any of the alternatives.

APS filed comments on the proposed rule during the public comment period, which ended on
November 19, 2010. We do not know when the EPA will issue a final rule, including required
compliance dates. We cannot currently predict the outcome of the EPA’s actions or whether such
actions will have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

In March 2008, the EPA adopted new, more
stringent eight-hour ozone standards, known as national ambient air quality standards or NAAQS. In
January 2010, the EPA proposed to adopt even more stringent eight-hour ozone NAAQS. As ozone
standards become more stringent, our fossil generation units may come under increasing pressure to
reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds and/or to generate emission
offsets for new projects or facility expansions. At this time, APS is unable to predict what
impact the adoption of these standards may have on its operations.



New Source Review

.

On April 6, 2009, APS received a request from the EPA under Section 114 of
the Clean Air Act seeking detailed information regarding projects at and operations of Four
Corners. This request is part of an enforcement initiative that the EPA has undertaken under the
Clean
Air Act. The EPA has taken the position that many utilities have made certain physical or
operational changes at their plants that should have triggered additional regulatory requirements
under the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act. Other electric utilities have
received and responded to similar Section 114 requests, and several of them have been the subject
of notices of violation and lawsuits by the EPA. APS responded to the EPA’s request in August 2009
and is currently unable to predict the timing or content of the EPA’s response, if any, or any
resulting actions.

On May 7, 2010, APS received a Notice of Intent to Sue from Earthjustice, on behalf of several
environmental organizations, related to alleged violations of the Clean Air Act at Four Corners
(the “Notice”). The Notice alleges New Source Review-related violations and NSPS violations. Under
the Clean Air Act, a citizens group is required to provide 60 days advance notice of its intent to
file a lawsuit. Within that 60-day time period, the EPA may step in and file a lawsuit regarding
the allegations. If the EPA does so, the citizens group is precluded from filing its own lawsuit,
but it may still intervene in the EPA’s lawsuit, if it so desires. The 60-day period lapsed in
early July 2010, and the EPA did not take any action. At this time, we cannot predict whether or
when Earthjustice might file a lawsuit.

Endangered Species Act.

On January 30, 2011, the Center for Biological Diversity, Dine Citizens
Against Running Our Environment, and San Juan Citizens Alliance field a lawsuit against the Office
of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (“OSM”) and the Department of the Interior, alleging
that OSM failed to engage in mandatory Endangered Species Act
(“ESA”) consultation with the Fish and
Wildlife Service prior to authorizing the renewal of an operating permit for the mine that serves
Four Corners. The lawsuit alleges that activities at the mine, including mining and the disposal of
coal combustion residue, will adversely affect several endangered species and their critical
habitats. The lawsuit requests the court to vacate and remand the mining permit and enjoin all
activities carried out under the permit until OSM has complied with the ESA. Although we are not a
party to the lawsuit, we are evaluating the lawsuit to determine its potential impact on plant
operations.

Superfund

.

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(“Superfund”) establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the
soil, water or air. Those who generated, transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a
contaminated site are among those who are PRPs. PRPs may be strictly, and often are jointly and
severally, liable for clean-up. On September 3, 2003, the EPA advised APS that the EPA considers
APS to be a PRP in the Motorola

nd

Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 (“OU3”) in
Phoenix, Arizona. APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site. APS and Pinnacle West
have agreed with the EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS facilities within
OU3. In addition, on September 23, 2009, APS agreed with the EPA and one other PRP to voluntarily
assist with the funding and management of the site-wide groundwater remedial investigation and
feasibility study work plan. APS estimates that its costs related to this investigation and study
will be approximately $1 million, which is reserved as a liability on its financial statements. We
anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future, but because the overall investigation
is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized, at the present time we
cannot accurately estimate our total expenditures.

By letter dated April 25, 2008, the EPA informed APS that it may be a PRP in the Gila River
Indian Reservation Superfund Site in Maricopa County, Arizona. APS, along with three other electric
utility companies, owns a parcel of property on which a transmission pole and a portion of a
transmission line are located. The property abuts the Gila River Indian Community boundary and, at
one time, may have been part of an airfield where crop dusting took place. Currently, the EPA is
only seeking payment from APS and four other PRPs for past cleanup-related costs involving
contamination from the crop dusting. Based upon the total amount of cleanup costs reported by the
EPA in its letter to APS, we do not expect that the resolution of this matter will have a material
adverse impact on APS’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites.

Certain properties which APS now owns or which were previously
owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of, or sites associated with,
manufactured gas plants. APS is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites. APS does not
expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations, cash flows or liquidity.



Navajo Nation Environmental Issues

Four Corners and the Navajo Plant are located on the Navajo Reservation and are held under
easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the Navajo Nation. See “Energy
Sources and Resource Planning — Generation Facilities — Coal Fueled Generating Facilities” above
for additional information regarding these plants.

In July 1995, the Navajo Nation enacted the Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control
Act, the Navajo Nation Safe Drinking Water Act and the Navajo Nation Pesticide Act (collectively,
the “Navajo Acts”). The Navajo Acts purport to give the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection
Agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality, drinking water and pesticide
activities, including those activities that occur at Four Corners and the Navajo Plant. On October
17, 1995, the Four Corners participants and the Navajo Plant participants each filed a lawsuit in
the District Court of the Navajo Nation, Window Rock District, challenging the applicability of the
Navajo Acts as to Four Corners and the Navajo Plant. The Court has stayed these proceedings
pursuant to a request by the parties, and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement.

In April 2000, the Navajo Nation Council approved operating permit regulations under the
Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act. APS believes the Navajo Nation exceeded
its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations. On July 12, 2000, the Four Corners
participants and the Navajo Plant participants each filed a petition with the Navajo Supreme Court
for review of these regulations. Those proceedings have been stayed, pending the settlement
negotiations mentioned above. APS cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter.

On May 18, 2005, APS, Salt River Project, as the operating agent for the Navajo Plant, and the
Navajo Nation executed a Voluntary Compliance Agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the
Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act. As a result of this agreement, APS sought,
and the courts granted, dismissal of the pending litigation in the Navajo Nation Supreme Court and
the Navajo Nation District Court, to the extent the claims relate to the Clean Air Act. The
agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other Navajo Acts. APS cannot
currently predict the outcome of this matter.

Water Supply

Assured supplies of water are important for APS’s generating plants. At the present time, APS
has adequate water to meet its needs. However, the Four Corners region, in which Four Corners is
located, has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants
if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area. APS is continuing to
work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect, if any, on future
operations of the plant. The effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time, and APS
cannot predict the ultimate outcome, if any, of the drought or whether the drought will adversely
affect the amount of power available, or the price thereof, from Four Corners.

Conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern United States have resulted
in numerous court actions, which, in addition to future supply conditions, have the potential to
impact APS operations.



San Juan River Adjudication.

Both groundwater and surface water in areas important to APS’s
operations have been the subject of inquiries, claims and legal proceedings, which will require a
number of years to resolve. APS is one of a number of parties in a proceeding, filed March
13, 1975, before the Eleventh Judicial District Court in New Mexico to adjudicate rights to a
stream system from which water for Four Corners is derived. An agreement reached with the Navajo
Nation in 1985, however, provides that if Four Corners loses a portion of its rights in the
adjudication, the Navajo Nation will provide, for an agreed upon cost, sufficient water from its
allocation to offset the loss.

Gila River Adjudication.

A summons served on APS in early 1986 required all water claimants
in the Lower Gila River Watershed in Arizona to assert any claims to water on or before January 20,
1987, in an action pending in Maricopa County, Arizona, Superior Court. Palo Verde is located
within the geographic area subject to the summons. APS’s rights and the rights of the other Palo
Verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at Palo Verde are potentially at issue in
this action. As operating agent of Palo Verde, APS filed claims that dispute the court’s
jurisdiction over the Palo Verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to
effluent relating to Palo Verde. Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights. Five of
APS’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons. APS’s
claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants.
Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights. In November 1999, the Arizona Supreme Court
issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal
government and Indian tribes. In addition, in September 2000, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a
decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims. Litigation on both
of these issues has continued in the trial court. In December 2005, APS and other parties filed a
petition with the Arizona Supreme Court requesting interlocutory review of a September 2005 trial
court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface
water rights. The Court denied the petition in May 2007, and the trial court is now proceeding
with implementation of its 2005 order. No trial date concerning APS’s water rights claims has been
set in this matter.

Little Colorado River Adjudication.

APS has also filed claims to water in the Little Colorado
River Watershed in Arizona in an action pending in the Apache County, Arizona, Superior Court,
which was originally filed on September 5, 1985. APS’s groundwater resource utilized at Cholla is
within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and, therefore, is potentially at issue in
the case. APS’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights.
Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights. A number of parties are in the process of
settlement negotiations with respect to certain claims in this matter. Other claims have been
identified as ready for litigation in motions filed with the court. No trial date concerning APS’s
water rights claims has been set in this matter.

Although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation, APS does not expect that the
described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of
operations, cash flows or liquidity.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the
description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report, set forth below are risks and
uncertainties that could affect our financial results. Unless otherwise indicated or the context
otherwise requires, the following risks and uncertainties apply to Pinnacle West and its
subsidiaries, including APS.

REGULATORY RISKS

Our financial condition depends upon APS’s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from
customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy.

APS is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal, state and local regulatory
agencies that significantly influence its business, liquidity, results of operations and its
ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner. The ACC regulates APS’s
retail electric rates and the FERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission
services. The profitability of APS is affected by the rates it may charge. Consequently, our
financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any
APS retail rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the ACC and the FERC.
Arizona, like certain other states, has a statute that allows the ACC to reopen prior decisions and
modify final orders under certain circumstances. The ACC must also approve APS’s issuance of
securities and any transfer of APS property used to provide retail electric service, and must
approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us, APS and our respective
affiliates. Decisions made by the ACC and the FERC could have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

APS’s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon
compliance with federal, state or local statutes and regulations, and obtaining and maintaining
certain regulatory permits, approvals and certificates.

APS must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes, regulations, rules, tariffs, and
orders of agencies that regulate APS’s business, including the FERC, the NRC, the EPA and state and
local governmental agencies. These agencies regulate many aspects of APS’s utility operations,
including safety and performance, emissions, siting and construction of facilities, customer
service and the rates that APS can charge retail and wholesale customers. Failure to comply can
subject APS to, among other things, fines and penalties. For example, under the Energy Policy Act
of 2005, the FERC can impose penalties (up to one million dollars per day per violation) for
failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards. In addition, APS is required to
have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from these agencies. APS believes the necessary
permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that APS’s
business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects. However,
changes in regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an
adverse impact on our results of operations. We are also unable to predict the impact on our
business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these
agencies

.

The operation of APS’s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and
potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related
requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of noncompliance,
the NRC has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased
inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut down of a unit, or both, depending upon
the NRC’s assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. The increased
costs resulting from penalties, a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to
achieve compliance with NRC requirements may adversely affect APS’s financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

APS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, and changes in, or liabilities
under, existing or new laws or regulations may increase APS’s cost of operations or impact its
business plans.

APS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its
present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid
waste, hazardous waste, and coal combustion products, which consist of bottom ash, fly ash and air
pollution control wastes. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating,
and other costs, particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions
obligations. These laws and regulations generally require APS to obtain and comply with a wide
variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals. If there is a delay or failure to
obtain any required environmental regulatory approval, or if APS fails to obtain, maintain or
comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to
additional expenses. In addition, failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and
regulations could result in civil liability or criminal penalties. Both public officials and
private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations. APS cannot
predict the outcome (financial or operational) of any related litigation that may arise.



Environmental Clean Up.

APS has been named as a PRP for a Superfund site in Phoenix, Arizona
and it could be named a PRP in the future for other environmental clean up at sites identified by a
regulatory body. APS cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future
expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up
costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose
joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties.

Regional Haze.

APS is currently awaiting a final rulemaking from the EPA that could impose
new requirements on Four Corners and the Navajo Plant. APS is also awaiting a final rulemaking
from ADEQ that could impose new requirements on Cholla. The EPA and ADEQ will require these plants
to install pollution control equipment that constitutes the best available retrofit technology to
lessen the impacts of emissions on visibility surrounding the plants. Depending upon the agencies’
final determinations of what constitutes BART for these plants, the financial impact of installing
the required pollution control equipment could jeopardize the economic viability of the plants or
the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants.

Coal Ash.

The EPA released proposed regulations governing the disposal of CCRs, which are
generated as a result of burning coal and consist of, among other things, fly ash and bottom ash.
The EPA proposed regulating CCRs as either non-hazardous or hazardous waste. APS currently
disposes of CCRs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at Four Corners and Cholla, and also sells a
portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete products. If the EPA
regulates CCRs as a hazardous solid waste or phases out APS’s ability to dispose of CCRs through
the use of ash ponds, APS could incur significant costs for CCR disposal and may be unable to
continue its sale of fly ash for beneficial reuse.

New Source Review.

The EPA has taken the position that many projects electric utilities have
performed are major modifications that trigger New Source Review requirements under the Clean Air
Act. The utilities generally have taken the position that these projects are routine maintenance
and did not result in emissions increases, and thus are not subject to New Source Review. In 2009,
APS received and responded to a request from the EPA regarding projects and operations of Four
Corners. A civilian organization notified the Four Corners participants that it intends to file a
citizen suit against the participants for alleged violations of New Source Review and the NSPS
program of the Clean Air Act. If the EPA seeks to impose New Source Review requirements at Four
Corners or any other APS plant, or if the citizen suit is filed and the citizens’ group prevails,
significant capital investments could be required to install new pollution control technologies.
The EPA could also seek civil penalties.

Mercury and other Hazardous Air Pollutants.

The EPA is required to adopt maximum achievable
control technology emissions standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants by November
2011. Compliance with the new standards will be required three years after the EPA issues its
final rule. Depending on the compliance requirements contained in the final rule, APS may need to
make significant capital investments to install additional pollution control equipment to meet
these new standards.

APS cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new
regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it.
Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating
restrictions, particularly if those costs incurred by APS are not fully recoverable from APS’s
customers, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations
or cash flows.



APS faces physical and operational risks related to climate change, and potential financial risks
resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse
gas emissions.

Concern over climate change, deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit
CO


, which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel, and other greenhouse
gas emissions. In addition, lawsuits have been filed against companies that emit greenhouse gases,
including a lawsuit filed by the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina, Alaska
against us and several other utilities seeking damages related to climate change, which was
dismissed but has been appealed.

Financial Risks — Potential Legislation and Regulation

. In the past several years, the
United States Congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions.
It is possible that some form of legislation may occur in the future at the federal level with
respect to greenhouse gas emissions.

If the United States Congress, or individual states or groups of states in which APS operates,
ultimately pass legislation regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases, any resulting limitations
on CO


and other greenhouse gas emissions could result in the creation of substantial
additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes, emissions allowances or
required equipment upgrades and could have a material adverse impact on all fossil fuel fired
generation facilities (particularly coal-fired facilities, which constitute approximately 28% of
APS’s generation capacity).

At the state level, the California legislature enacted legislation to address greenhouse gas
emissions and the California Air Resources Board approved regulations that will establish a
cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas. This legislation, regulation and other state-specific
initiatives may affect APS’s business, including sales into the impacted states or the ability of
its out-of-state power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coal-fired
power plants, including Four Corners following expiration of the current lease term in 2016.

In addition, the EPA has determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and
welfare. This determination was made in response to a 2007 United States Supreme Court ruling that
greenhouse gases fit within the Clean Air Act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and, as a
result, the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under
the Clean Air Act. As a result of the endangerment finding, the EPA determined that the Clean Air
Act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major greenhouse gas emitting
sources, including power plants. Several groups have filed lawsuits challenging the EPA’s
endangerment finding. APS cannot predict what rules or regulations may ultimately result from the
EPA’s endangerment finding, whether the parties challenging the endangerment finding will be
successful, or what impact other potential rules or regulations will have on APS’s operations.
Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations could force APS and other
similarly-situated electric power generators to retire or suspend operations at certain coal-fired
facilities.

Physical and Operational Risks.

Assuming that the primary physical and operational risks to
APS from climate change are increased potential for drought or water shortage, and a mild to
moderate increase in ambient temperatures, APS believes it is taking the appropriate steps to
respond to these risks. Weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are
common occurrences in the Southwest’s desert area, and these are risks that APS considers in the
normal course of business in
the engineering and construction of its electric system. Large increases in ambient
temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and represent a
greater challenge.



If APS cannot meet or maintain the level of renewable energy required under Arizona’s increasing
Renewable Energy Standards, APS may be subject to penalties or fines for non-compliance.

The RES requires APS to supply an increasing percentage of renewable energy each year, so that
the amount of retail electricity sales from eligible renewable resources is at least 3% of total
retail sales by 2011. This amount increases annually to 15% by 2025. In its 2009 retail rate case
settlement agreement, APS agreed to exceed these standards and committed to an interim renewable
energy target of 1,700 GWh of renewable resources to be in service by year end 2015 in addition to
its 2008 renewable resource commitments. Taken together, APS’s commitment is estimated to be 3,400
GWh, or approximately 10% of retail sales, by year end 2015. A portion of this total renewable
energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources
(generally, small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties). The distributed
energy requirement is 25% of the overall RES requirement of 3% in 2011 and increases to 30% of the
applicable RES requirement in 2012 and subsequent years. If APS fails to implement any of its
annual ACC-approved renewable implementation plans, it may be subject to penalties imposed by the
ACC, including APS’s inability to recover certain costs. Compliance with the distributed resource
requirement is contingent upon customer participation. The development of any renewable generation
facilities resulting from the RES is subject to many other risks, including risks relating to
financing, permitting, technology, fuel supply, and the construction of sufficient transmission
capacity to support these facilities.

Deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition, which
could have a significant adverse impact on APS’s business and its results of operations.

In 1999, the ACC approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in
Arizona. Retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on APS due to an
impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of
capital. Although some very limited retail competition existed in APS’s service area in 1999 and
2000, there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility
services to APS’s customers. As a result, APS cannot predict if, when, and the extent to which,
additional competitors may re-enter APS’s service territory.

In 2010, the ACC issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar
facilities for non-profit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that
calculates payments based on the energy produced are not “public service corporations” under the
Arizona Constitution, and are therefore not regulated by the ACC. A second matter is pending with
the ACC to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader
customer base under the same business model. The use of such products by customers within our
territory would result in some level of competition. APS cannot predict whether the ACC will deem
these vendors “public service corporations” subject to ACC regulation and when, and the extent to
which, additional service providers will enter APS’s service territory, increasing the level of
competition in the market.



OPERATIONAL RISKS

APS’s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for
electricity.

Weather Conditions.

Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and
affect the price of energy commodities. Electric power demand is generally a seasonal business.
In Arizona, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at
that time. As a result, APS’s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal
basis. In addition, APS has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income,
when weather conditions are milder. As a result, unusually mild weather could diminish APS’s
results of operations.

Higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack, which might result in lowered soil moisture and
an increased threat of forest fires. Forest fires could threaten APS’s communities and electric
transmission lines. Any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact APS’s
results of operations.

Effects of Energy Conservation Measures and Distributed Energy.

The ACC has enacted rules
regarding energy efficiency that mandate a 22% annual energy savings requirement by 2020. This
will likely increase participation by APS customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs
and other demand-side management efforts, which in turn will impact the demand for electricity.
The rules also include a requirement for the ACC to review and address financial disincentives,
recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost income/revenue that would result from lower
sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements. To that end, the ACC passed a policy
statement on per customer revenue decoupling in December of 2010. The policy statement will have
no effect on APS’s rates unless implemented in a rate case. The 2009 retail rate case settlement
agreement also establishes energy efficiency goals for APS that begin in 2010 that extend through
2012, subjecting APS to energy efficiency requirements slightly greater for those years than
required under the rules described above.

APS must also meet certain distributed energy requirements. A portion of APS’s total
renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy
resources (generally, small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties). The
distributed energy requirement is 25% of the overall RES requirement of 3% in 2011 and increases to
30% of the applicable RES requirement in 2012 and subsequent years. Customer participation in
distributed energy programs would result in lower demand, since customers would be meeting some or
all of their own energy needs.

Reduced demand due to these energy efficiency and distributed energy requirements, unless
offset through ratemaking mechanisms, could have a material adverse impact on APS’s financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The operation of power generation facilities involves risks that could result in unscheduled power
outages or reduced output, which could materially affect APS’s results of operations

.

The operation of power generation facilities involves certain risks, including the risk of
breakdown or failure of equipment, fuel interruption, and performance below expected levels of
output or efficiency. Unscheduled outages, including extensions of scheduled outages due to
mechanical failures or other complications, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of
APS’s business. If
APS’s facilities operate below expectations, especially during its peak seasons, it may lose
revenue or incur additional expenses, including increased purchased power expenses.



The lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on APS’s
business and results of operations.

Assured supplies of water are important for APS’s generating plants. Water in the
southwestern United States is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding
the right to access and use such limited supply of water. Both groundwater and surface water in
areas important to APS’s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries, claims and
legal proceedings. In addition, the Four Corners region, in which Four Corners is located, has
been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate
moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area. APS’s inability to access
sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of
operations.

The ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on Indian lands could
result in uncertainty related to continued leases, easements and rights-of-way, which could have a
significant impact on our business.

Certain APS power plants, including Four Corners, and portions of the transmission lines that
carry power from these plants are located on Indian lands pursuant to leases, easements or other
rights-of-way that are effective for specified periods. APS is currently unable to predict the
final outcome of discussions with the appropriate Indian tribes and approval by their respective
governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases, easements and rights-of-way.

There are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities, such as
environmental, health, fuel supply, spent fuel disposal, regulatory and financial risks and the
risk of terrorist attack.

APS has an ownership interest in and operates, on behalf of a group of participants, Palo
Verde, which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the United States. Palo Verde
is subject to environmental, health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate
supplies of nuclear fuel; the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel; the ability to maintain
adequate reserves for decommissioning; potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these
facilities; the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks; and
unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems. APS maintains nuclear decommissioning
trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these
risks; however, it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. In
addition, APS may be required under federal law to pay up to $118 million (but not more than $18
million per year) of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at Palo
Verde, but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. Although we have no reason to
anticipate a serious nuclear incident at Palo Verde, if an incident did occur, it could materially
and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A major incident at a
nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or
licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.

The operation of Palo Verde requires licenses that need to be periodically renewed and/or
extended. In December 2008, APS applied for renewed operating licenses for all three Palo Verde
units for 20 years beyond the expirations of the current licenses. APS does not anticipate any
problems renewing these licenses. However, as a result of potential terrorist threats and
increased public
scrutiny of utilities, the licensing process could result in increased licensing or compliance
costs that are difficult to predict.



The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial
losses that negatively impact our results of operations.

APS’s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices. APS is exposed to
the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity, natural gas
and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist. We have established procedures to manage
risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives,
including exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options, and swaps.
As part of our overall risk management program, we enter into derivative transactions to hedge
purchases and sales of electricity and fuels. The changes in market value of such contracts have a
high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity. To the extent that commodity markets
are illiquid, we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies, which could result in
greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that
negatively impact our results of operations.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), which was
signed into law in July 2010, contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability
of the over-the counter, or OTC, derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation. The
Dodd-Frank Act could restrict, among other things, trading positions in the energy futures markets,
require different collateral or settlement positions, or increase regulatory reporting over
derivative positions. Based on the provisions included in the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementation
of regulations yet to be developed, these changes could, among other things, impact our ability to
hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging
programs.

We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties. We
use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties.
Despite the fact that the majority of APS’s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by
the rating agencies, there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could
default, which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period.

Changes in technology could create challenges for APS’s existing business.

Research and development activities are ongoing to assess alternative technologies that
produce power or reduce power consumption, including clean coal and coal gasification, renewable
technologies including photovoltaic (solar) cells, customer-sited generation (solar) and efficiency
technologies, and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment, such as more efficient
gas turbines. Advances in these, or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production,
making APS’s existing generating facilities less economical. In addition, advances in technology
could reduce the demand for power supply, which could adversely affect APS’s business.

APS is pursuing and implementing smart grid technologies, including advanced transmission and
distribution system technologies, digital meters enabling two-way communications between the
utility and its customers, and electric usage monitoring devices for customers’ homes and
businesses. Many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative
technologies have not yet been widely used or tested, and their use on large-scale systems is not
as advanced and established as APS’s existing technologies and equipment. Uncertainties and
unknowns related to these and other
advancements in technology and equipment could adversely affect APS’s business if national
standards develop that do not embrace the current technologies or if the technologies and equipment
fail to perform as expected. In addition, widespread installation and acceptance of these devices
could enable the entry of new market participants, such as technology companies, into the interface
between APS and its customers.



We are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial
condition.

Like most companies in the electric utility industry, our workforce is aging and a number of
our employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although we have
undertaken efforts to recruit and train new employees, we may not be successful. We are subject to
other employee workforce factors, such as the availability of qualified personnel, the need to
negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees and potential work stoppages.
Exposure to these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business,
financial condition or results of operations.

We are subject to information security risks.

In the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security and customer
information. We are subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding
and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of our information
systems such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, including
confidential customer information or system operating information could have a material adverse
impact on our business and financial condition.

FINANCIAL RISKS

Financial market disruptions may increase our financing costs or limit our access to the credit and
capital markets, which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our
financial strategy.

We rely on access to short-term money markets, longer-term capital markets and the bank market
as a significant source of liquidity and for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow
from our operations. We believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial
markets. However, certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely
affect our ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include:

•

continuation of the current economic downturn;

•

terrorist attacks or threatened attacks;

•

mergers among financial institutions and the overall health of the banking industry;
or

•

the overall health of the utility industry.

In addition, the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be
satisfied for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting
our lenders, which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources.



Changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates, which would increase our
interest expense on our debt and reduce funds available to us for our current plans. Additionally,
an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by:

•

reducing our credit ratings;

•

increasing the cost of future debt financing and refinancing;

•

increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; and

•

requiring us to dedicate an increased portion of our cash flow from operations to
payments on our debt, which would reduce funds available to us for operations, future
business opportunities or other purposes.

A reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our current ratings are set forth in “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Credit Ratings” in
Item 7. We cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given
period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in
its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely
affect the market price of Pinnacle West’s and APS’s securities, limit our access to capital and
increase our borrowing costs, which would diminish our financial results. We would be required to
pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and our potential pool of investors and funding
sources could decrease. In addition, borrowing costs under certain of our existing credit
facilities depend on our credit ratings. A downgrade would also require us to provide substantial
additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various
counterparties. If our short-term ratings were to be lowered, it could completely eliminate any
possible future access to the commercial paper market. We note that the ratings from rating
agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be
evaluated independently of any other rating.

Market performance, changing interest rates and other economic factors could decrease the value of
our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds and increase our related
obligations, resulting in significant additional funding that could negatively impact our business.

Disruptions in the capital markets and/or decline in market value may adversely affect the
values of fixed income and equity investments held in our employee benefit plan trusts and nuclear
decommissioning trusts. We have significant obligations in these areas and hold substantial assets
in these trusts. A decline in the market value of the investments in these trusts may increase our
funding requirements. Additionally, the pension plan and other postretirement benefit liabilities
are impacted by the discount rate, which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and
other postretirement benefit obligations. Declining interest rates impact the discount rate, and
may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs, cash contributions,
regulatory assets, and charges to other comprehensive income. Changes in demographics, including
increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the
funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit
plans. A significant portion of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all
of the nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices. Our inability
to fully recover these costs in a timely manner or any increased funding obligations could
negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



We may be required to adopt IFRS. The ultimate adoption of such standards could negatively
impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.

IFRS is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the International
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) that is being considered by the SEC to replace accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for use in preparation of
financial statements. If the SEC requires mandatory adoption of IFRS, we may lose our ability to
use regulatory accounting treatment, and would follow IFRS rather than GAAP for the preparation of
our financial statements beginning in 2014. In the meantime, the FASB and the IASB are working on
several accounting standards jointly to converge certain accounting differences before 2014. The
implementation and adoption of these new standards and the inability to use regulatory accounting
could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our cash flow largely depends on the performance of APS.

We conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiary, APS. Substantially all of our
consolidated assets are held by APS. Accordingly, our cash flow is dependent upon the earnings and
cash flows of APS and its distributions to us. APS is a separate and distinct legal entity and has
no obligation to make distributions to us.

APS’s debt agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends, make distributions or
otherwise transfer funds to us. In addition, an ACC financing order requires APS to maintain a
common equity ratio of at least 40% and does not allow APS to pay common dividends if the payment
would reduce its common equity below that threshold. The common equity ratio, as defined in the
ACC order, is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long-term
debt, including current maturities of long-term debt.

Pinnacle West’s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because
its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of
its subsidiaries.

Because Pinnacle West is structured as a holding company, all existing and future debt and
other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt
securities. The assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available, in the first
instance, to service their own debt and other obligations. Our ability to have the benefit of
their assets and cash flows, particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress
affecting our subsidiaries, would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our
subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response
to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control:

•

variations in our quarterly operating results;

•

operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts
and investors;

•

changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial
estimates by securities analysts and investors;



•

developments generally affecting industries in which we operate, particularly the
energy distribution and energy generation industries;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint
marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;

•

announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;

•

favorable or adverse regulatory or legislative developments;

•

our dividend policy;

•

future sales by the Company of equity or equity-linked securities; and

•

general domestic and international economic conditions.

In addition, the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been
unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations
may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of Arizona law make it difficult
for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts.

These provisions, which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control
premium, include the following:

•

restrictions on our ability to engage in a wide range of “business combination”
transactions with an “interested shareholder” (generally, any person who owns 10% or
more of our outstanding voting power or any of our affiliates or associates) or any
affiliate or associate of an interested shareholder, unless specific conditions are
met;

•

anti-greenmail provisions of Arizona law and our bylaws that prohibit us from
purchasing shares of our voting stock from beneficial owners of more than 5% of our
outstanding shares unless specified conditions are satisfied;

•

the ability of the Board of Directors to increase the size of the Board and fill
vacancies on the Board, whether resulting from such increase, or from death,
resignation, disqualification or otherwise; and

•

the ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and, with respect to preferred
stock, the other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares
without shareholder approval.

While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us
to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable the Board to hinder or frustrate a
transaction that some, or a majority, of our shareholders might believe to be in their best
interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent
directors.

SunCor’s continuing wind-down of its real estate business may give rise to various claims.

Since 2009, SunCor has been engaged in a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations,
master-planned communities, land parcels, commercial assets and golf courses in order to reduce its
outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2010, SunCor had no existing bank debt and had total assets
remaining on its books of $16 million, consisting of $8 million of intercompany receivables, $3
million
of assets held for sale and $5 million of other assets. SunCor is focusing on concluding an
orderly wind-down of its business. This effort includes addressing contingent liabilities, such as
warranty and construction claims that may be brought by property owners and potential funding
obligations to local taxing districts that financed infrastructure at certain of its real estate
developments.

Pinnacle West has not guaranteed any of SunCor’s obligations. SunCor’s remaining business
operations, and its ability to generate cash from operations, are minimal. As a result, SunCor may
seek judicial protection to effectuate a resolution of any claims that cannot be successfully
addressed by other means. In such event, Pinnacle West could be exposed to the uncertainties and
complexities inherent for parent companies in such proceedings.

Transmission and Distribution Facilities

Current Facilities

. APS’s transmission facilities consist of approximately 5,992 pole miles
of overhead lines and approximately 49 miles of underground lines, 5,769 miles of which are located
in Arizona. APS’s distribution facilities consist of approximately 11,098 miles of overhead lines
and approximately 17,417 miles of underground primary cable, all of which are located in Arizona.
APS shares ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies. The following
table shows APS’s jointly-owned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010:

Expansion.

Each year APS prepares and files with the ACC a ten-year transmission plan. In
APS’s 2011 plan, APS projects it will invest approximately $450 million in new transmission over
the next ten years, which includes 258 miles of new lines. This investment will increase the
import capability into metropolitan Phoenix by approximately 6% and will increase the import
capability into the Yuma area by approximately 39%. One significant project presently nearing
completion is the Morgan — Pinnacle Peak project, which consists of 26 miles of 500kV and 230kV
lines.

APS continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support
renewable energy facilities. Two such projects, which are included in APS’s 2011 transmission
plan, are the Delany to Palo Verde line and the North Gila to Palo Verde line, both of which are
intended to support the transmission of renewable energy to Phoenix and California.



Plant and Transmission Line Leases and Easements on Indian Lands

The Navajo Plant and Four Corners are located on land held under leases from the Navajo Nation
and also under easements from the federal government. The easement and lease for the Navajo Plant
expire in 2019 and the easement and lease for Four Corners expire in 2016. Each of the leases
contains an option to extend for an additional 25-year period from the end of the existing lease
term, for a rental amount tied to the original rent payment adjusted based on an index. The
easements do not contain an express renewal option and it is unclear what conditions to renewal or
extension of the easements may be imposed. APS is currently working with the Navajo Nation to
extend the Four Corners leases and the transmission rights-of-way discussed below for an additional
twenty-five years. (See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource
Planning — Generation Facilities — Coal Fueled Generating Facilities” in Item 1 for details of
this extension and the related required approvals.) The ultimate cost of renewal of the Navajo
Plant and Four Corners leases and easements is uncertain. The coal contracted for use in these
plants is also located on Indian reservations.

Certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants
are located on Indian lands pursuant to easements or other rights-of-way that are effective for
specified periods. Some of these rights-of-way have expired and our renewal applications have not
yet been acted upon by the appropriate Indian tribes. Other rights expire at various times in the
future and renewal action by the applicable tribe will be required at that time. The majority of
our transmission lines residing on Indian lands are on the Navajo Nation. The Four Corners and
Navajo Plant leases provide Navajo Nation consent to certain of the rights-of-way for transmission
lines related to those plants at a specified rental rate for the original term of the rights-of-way
and for a like payment in any renewal period. In addition, a 1985 amendment to the leases provides
a formula for calculating payments for certain new and renewal rights-of-way. However, some of our
rights-of-way are not covered by the leases, or are granted by other Indian tribes. In recent
negotiations with other utilities or companies for renewal of similar rights-of-way, certain of the
affected Indian tribes have required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid
in the past for such rights-of-way or that are typical for similar permits across non-Indian lands;
however, we are unaware of the underlying agreements and/or specific circumstances surrounding
these renewals. The ultimate cost of renewal of the rights-of-way for our transmission lines is
uncertain. We are monitoring these rights-of-way and easement issues and have had extensive
discussions with the Navajo Nation regarding them. We are currently unable to predict the outcome
of this matter.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Pinnacle West’s Consolidated
Financial Statements and APS’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes that appear
in Item 8 of this report. For information on the broad factors that may cause our actual future
results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate, see “Forward-Looking Statements” at
the front of this report and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.

OVERVIEW

Pinnacle West owns all of the outstanding common stock of APS. APS is a vertically-integrated
electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of
Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson
metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona. APS accounts for substantially all of
our revenues and earnings, and is expected to continue to do so.

Areas of Business Focus

Operational Performance, Reliability and Recent Developments.

Nuclear.

In 2010, Palo Verde achieved its best generation year ever, producing over 31
million megawatt-hours, with an overall station capacity factor of 90.5%. The generation from each
Palo Verde operating unit directly reflects the station’s currently effective 18-month refueling
cycle. In 2010, Palo Verde successfully refueled both Unit 1 and Unit 3. As part of the 2010
refueling outages, Palo Verde installed new reactor vessel closure heads and simplified head
assembly modifications. These projects are designed to provide safety benefits, eliminate costly
inspections and reduce the duration of future outages.

Coal and Related Environmental Matters.

APS-operated coal plants, Four Corners and
Cholla, achieved net capacity factors of 82% and 79%, respectively, in 2010. APS is focused on the
impacts on its coal fleet that may result from potential legislation and increased regulation
concerning greenhouse gas emissions. Recent concern over climate change and other
emission-related issues could have a significant impact on our capital expenditures and operating
costs in the form of taxes, emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades for these plants.
APS is closely monitoring its long range capital management plans, understanding that any resulting
legislation and regulation could impact the economic viability of certain plants, as well as the
willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any such equipment upgrades. In
particular, on October 6, 2010, the EPA issued its proposed determination for “Best Available
Retrofit Technology” (BART) requirements for Four Corners that, as proposed, would require
installation of additional pollution control equipment on all five of the plant’s units. Based on
APS’s current ownership share of Four Corners, APS currently estimates that its total costs for the
proposed controls could be up to approximately $400 million for nitrogen oxide controls and about
$220 million for particulate removal equipment. It is currently evaluating the impacts of the
proposed determination and intends to submit comments during the EPA’s comment period. See
“Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Environmental Matters” in Item 1 and environmental
and climate change-related risks described in Item 1A for additional environmental and climate
change developments and risks facing APS.



In addition, SCE, a participant in Four Corners, has indicated that certain California
legislation may prohibit it from making emission control expenditures at the plant. On November 8,
2010, APS and SCE entered into an asset purchase agreement, providing for the purchase by APS of
SCE’s 48% interest in each of Units 4 and 5 of Four Corners. The purchase price is $294 million,
subject to certain adjustments. Completion of the purchase by APS, which is expected to occur in
the second half of 2012, is subject to the receipt of approvals by the ACC, the California Public
Utilities Commission and the FERC. APS and SCE filed applications with their respective
commissions seeking requisite authority or approvals to complete the transaction. Closing is also
conditioned on the execution of a new coal supply contract for the lease renewal period described
below, expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and
other typical closing conditions.

APS, on behalf of the Four Corners participants, has negotiated amendments to an existing
facility lease with the Navajo Nation which would extend the Four Corners leasehold interest to
2041. Execution by the Navajo Nation of the lease amendments is a condition to closing of the
purchase by APS of SCE’s interests in Four Corners. The execution of these amendments by the Navajo
Nation requires the approval of the Navajo Nation Council, which
occurred on February 15, 2011 and is awaiting final signature by the
Nation’s President. The effectiveness of the amendments also
requires the approval of the DOI, as does a related Federal rights-of-way grant which the Four
Corners participants will pursue. A Federal environmental review will be conducted as part of the
DOI review process.

Pursuant to a Co-Tenancy Agreement among the Four Corners participants, the other participants
have a right of first refusal to purchase shares of SCE’s interests proportional to their current
ownership percentages. The exercise of this purchase right by any of the other participants must be
exercised by March 8, 2011. If any of the purchase rights are exercised, the amount available for
purchase by APS would be reduced. At this time APS does not know whether any of the other
participants will exercise the right of first refusal.

APS has announced that, if APS’s purchase of SCE’s interests in Units 4 and 5 at Four Corners
is consummated, it will close Units 1, 2 and 3 at the plant. These events will change the plant’s
overall generating capacity from 2,100 MW to 1,540 MW and APS’s entitlement from the plant from 791
MW to 970 MW. When applying for approval to purchase Units 4 and 5, APS also requested from the ACC
recovery of any unrecovered costs associated with the closure of Units 1, 2 and 3.

Transmission and Delivery.

In the area of transmission and delivery to its customers, APS
ranked favorably during 2010, with top quartile performance for average customer outage time and
its best reliability year to date. During 2010, APS undertook several significant transmission
projects, including the Morgan to Pinnacle Peak transmission line scheduled for completion in 2011.
APS’s 2011 transmission plan projects that it will invest approximately $450 million in new
transmission over the next ten years, which includes 258 miles of new lines. The first three years
of these additions are included in the capital expenditures table presented in the “Liquidity”
section below along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements. APS is working
closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs resulting from the current
focus on renewable energy. APS is also working to establish and expand smart grid technology
throughout its service territory designed to provide long-term benefits both to APS and its
customers. APS is piloting and deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow
customers to better monitor their energy use and needs, minimize system outage durations and the
number of customers that experience outages, and facilitate cost savings to APS through improved
reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions, including remote meter reading
and remote connects and disconnects.



Renewable Energy

.

The ACC approved the RES in 2006, recognizing the importance of renewable
energy to our state. The renewable energy requirement is 3% of retail electric sales in 2011 and
increases annually until it reaches 15% in 2025. In the 2009 retail rate case settlement
agreement, APS agreed to exceed the RES standards, committing to 1,700 GWh of new renewable
resources to be in service by year-end 2015 in addition to its 2008 renewable resource commitments.
Taken together, APS’s commitment is estimated to be 3,400 GWh or approximately 10% of APS’s retail
energy sales by year-end 2015, which is double the existing RES target of 5% for that year. See
Note 3. A component of the RES is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems
(generally speaking, small-scale renewable technologies that are located on customers’ properties).

APS has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 875 MW,
including solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and biogas. Of this portfolio, 288 MW are currently in
operation and 587 MW are under contract for development or are under construction. Renewable
resources in operation include 5 MW of utility-scale facilities owned by APS, 223 MW of long-term
purchased power agreements, and an estimated 60 MW of customer-sited, third-party owned distributed
energy resources.

To achieve our RES requirements, as mentioned above, to date APS has entered into contracts
for 587 MW of renewable resources that are planned, in development or under construction. APS’s
strategy to procure these resources includes new facilities to be owned by APS, purchased power
contracts for new facilities and ongoing development of distributed energy resources. Through the
AZ Sun Program, approved by the ACC on March 3, 2010, APS plans to own 100 MW of solar photovoltaic
power plants across Arizona by investing up to $500 million through 2014. Under this program, APS
has executed contracts for the development of 83 MW of new solar generation, representing an
investment commitment of approximately $377 million. See Note 3 for additional details of the AZ
Sun Program, including the related cost recovery. APS has also entered into long-term purchased
power agreements for 382 MW from solar, wind and biogas facilities currently planned, in
development or under construction, and 122 MW from distributed energy resources. Agreements for
the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions, including
successful siting, permitting and interconnection of the project to the electric grid.

APS continues to actively consider opportunities to enhance its renewable energy portfolio,
both to ensure its compliance with the Renewable Energy Standard and to meet the needs of its
customer base

.

Demand Side Management.

Arizona regulators are placing an increased focus on energy
efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy,
while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy.
In December 2009, the ACC initiated Energy Efficiency rulemaking, with a proposed Energy
Efficiency Standard of 22% cumulative annual energy savings by 2020. The 22% figure represents the
cumulative reduction in future energy usage through 2020 attributable to energy efficiency
initiatives. On July 27, 2010, the proposed Energy Efficiency Standard was adopted by the ACC,
approved by the Arizona Attorney General and became effective on January 1, 2011. This ambitious
standard will likely impact Arizona’s future energy resource needs.



Rate Matters.

APS needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating
expenditures to maintain adequate financial health. APS’s retail rates are regulated by the ACC
and its wholesale electric rates (primarily for transmission) are regulated by the FERC. At the
end of 2009, the ACC approved a settlement agreement entered into by APS and twenty-one of the
twenty-three other parties to APS’s general retail rate case, with modifications that did not
materially affect the overall economic
terms of the agreement. The rate case settlement authorizes and requires equity infusions
into APS of at least $700 million prior to the end of 2014. The settlement demonstrated
cooperation among APS, the ACC staff, the Residential Utility Consumer Office (RUCO) and other
intervenors to the rate case, and establishes a future rate case filing plan that allows APS the
opportunity to help shape Arizona’s energy future outside of continual rate cases. See Note 3 for
a detailed discussion of the settlement agreement terms and information on APS’s FERC rates.

APS has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to APS of its
fuel and transmission costs, and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its
demand-side management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs. These mechanisms are
described more fully in Note 3.

On October 18, 2010, the Chairman of the ACC issued a draft decoupling policy statement for
consideration by the commission. On December 15, 2010 the ACC unanimously approved a slightly
modified decoupling policy statement supportive of using a revenue-per-customer methodology, which
is the mechanism APS and a number of other parties support. Decoupling refers to a ratemaking
design which reduces or removes the linkage between sales and utility revenues and/or profits,
reducing utility disincentives to the adoption of programs that benefit customers by saving energy.
Mechanically, decoupling compares actual versus authorized revenues or revenue per customer over a
period and either credits or collects any differences from customers in a subsequent period. The
policy permits regulated utilities to file a decoupling proposal in their next general rate case.
APS intends to include a decoupling model consistent with the policy statement for consideration in
its upcoming general rate case, currently expected to be filed in June 2011.

Financial Strength and Flexibility.

Pinnacle West and APS currently have ample borrowing
capacity under their respective credit facilities and have been able to access these facilities,
ensuring adequate liquidity for each company. In early February 2010, APS entered into a $500
million revolving credit facility, replacing its $377 million revolving credit facility that
would have otherwise terminated in December 2010. At that same time, Pinnacle West entered into a
$200 million revolving credit facility that replaced its $283 million facility that also would have
otherwise terminated in December 2010. Since March 2010, Pinnacle West and APS have accessed the
commercial paper market, which neither company had utilized since the third quarter of 2008 due to
negative market conditions.

In April 2010, Pinnacle West issued 6,900,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of
$38.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $253 million. Pinnacle West
contributed all of the net proceeds from this offering into APS in the form of equity infusions.
APS has used these capital contributions to repay short-term indebtedness, to finance capital
expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.

In early February 2011, APS entered into a $500 million revolving credit facility, replacing
its $489 million revolving credit facility that would have otherwise terminated in September 2011.

SunCor Real Estate Operations.

As a result of the continuing distressed conditions in the
real estate markets, during 2009 SunCor undertook a program to dispose of its homebuilding
operations, master-planned communities, land parcels, commercial assets and golf courses in order
to reduce its outstanding debt. At December 31, 2010, SunCor had total remaining assets of about
$16 million, which includes approximately $3 million of assets held for sale. See “Liquidity and
Capital Resources — Other Subsidiaries — SunCor” below for information regarding 2010 asset sales
and liquidity matters.



District Cooling Business Sale

. On June 22, 2010, APSES sold its district cooling business
consisting of operations in downtown Phoenix, Tucson, and on certain Arizona State University
campuses. The sale resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $25 million. APSES is now
focused on its core business of energy conservation and renewable energy contracting services.

Subsidiaries.

The operations of APSES and our other first tier subsidiary, El Dorado, are not
expected to have any material impact on our financial results, or to require any material amounts
of capital, over the next three years.

Key Financial Drivers

In addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above, many factors influence
our financial results and our future financial outlook, including those listed below. We closely
monitor these factors to plan for the Company’s current needs, and to adjust our expectations,
financial budgets and forecasts appropriately.

Electric Operating Revenues.

For the years 2008 through 2010, retail electric revenues
comprised approximately 93% of our total electric operating revenues. Our electric operating
revenues are affected by customer growth or decline, variations in weather from period to period,
customer mix, average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs, electricity
rates and tariffs, the recovery of PSA deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms.
Off-system sales of excess generation output, purchased power and natural gas are included in
regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are
credited to APS’s retail customers through the PSA. These revenue transactions are affected by the
availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions,
including competition, demand and prices.

Customer and Sales Growth.

Customer growth in APS’s service territory for the year ended
December 31, 2010 was 0.6% compared with the prior year. For the three years 2008 through 2010,
APS’s customer growth averaged 0.9% per year. We currently expect customer growth to average about
1.7% per year for 2011 through 2013 due to anticipated improving economic conditions both nationally and in Arizona.
Retail sales in kilowatt-hours, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, for 2010
declined 1.0% compared to the prior year, reflecting the poor economic conditions in 2010 and the
effects of our energy efficiency programs. For the three years 2008 through 2010, APS’s actual
retail electricity sales in kilowatt-hours, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations,
declined at an average annual rate of 0.9%. We currently estimate that total retail electricity
sales in kilowatt-hours will remain flat on average per year during 2011 through 2013, including
the effects of APS’s energy efficiency programs, but excluding the effects of weather variations.
A continuation of the economic downturn, or the failure of the Arizona economy to rebound in the
near future, could further impact these estimates. The customer and sales growth referred to in
this paragraph apply to Native Load customers.

Actual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from our projections as
a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, usage patterns, impacts
of energy efficiency programs and responses to retail price changes. Our experience indicates that
a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatt-hour sales projection attributable to such economic
factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income
of up to $10 million.

Weather.

In forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above, we assume normal
weather patterns based on historical data. Historical extreme weather variations have resulted in
annual variations in net income in excess of $20 million. However, our experience indicates that
the more
typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net
income of up to $10 million.



Fuel and Purchased Power Costs.

Fuel and purchased power costs included on our Consolidated
Statements of Income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes, existing contracts for
purchased power and generation fuel, our power plant performance, transmission availability or
constraints, prevailing market prices, new generating plants being placed in service in our market
areas, our hedging program for managing such costs and PSA deferrals and the related amortization.

Operations and Maintenance Expenses

.

Operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by
growth, power plant operations, maintenance of utility plant (including generation, transmission,
and distribution facilities), inflation, outages, higher-trending pension and other postretirement
benefit costs, renewable energy and demand side management related expenses (which are offset by
the same amount of regulated electricity segment operating revenues) and other factors. In its
2009 retail rate case settlement, APS committed to operational expense reductions from 2010 through
2014 and received approval to defer certain pension and other postretirement benefit cost increases
to be incurred in 2011 and 2012.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses.

Depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted
by net additions to utility plant and other property (such as new generation, transmission, and
distribution facilities), and changes in depreciation and amortization rates. See “Capital
Expenditures” below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities. We have
also applied to the NRC for renewed operating licenses for each of the Palo Verde units. If the
NRC grants the extension, we estimate that our annual pretax depreciation expense will decrease by
approximately $34 million at the later of the license extension date or January 1, 2012.

Property Taxes.

Taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes, which are
affected by the value of property in-service and under construction, assessment ratios, and tax
rates. The average property tax rate for APS, which currently owns the majority of our property,
was 8.0% of the assessed value in 2010, 7.5% of the assessed value in 2009 and 7.8% of the assessed
value in 2008. We expect property taxes to increase as we add new utility plants (including new
generation, transmission and distribution facilities described below under “Capital Additions”) and
as we improve our existing facilities.

Income Taxes

.

Income taxes are affected by the amount of pre-tax book income, income tax
rates, and certain non-taxable items, such as the AFUDC. In addition, income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with
taxing authorities.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the
interest rates on that debt (see Note 6.) The primary factors affecting borrowing levels are
expected to be our capital expenditures, long-term debt maturities, equity issuances and internally
generated cash flow. An allowance for borrowed funds offsets a portion of interest expense while
capital projects are under construction. We stop accruing AFUDC on a project when it is placed in
commercial operation.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Pinnacle West’s reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which
consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily
electricity service to Native Load customers) and related activities and includes electricity
generation, transmission and distribution.

Our reportable business segments reflect a change from previously reported information. As of
December 31, 2010, our real estate activities are no longer considered a segment requiring separate
reporting or disclosure. In 2009 our real estate subsidiary, SunCor, began disposing of its
homebuilding operations, master-planned communities, land parcels, commercial assets and golf
courses in order to reduce its outstanding debt (see Note 23). At December 31, 2010, SunCor had
total remaining assets of about $16 million, which includes approximately $3 million of assets held
for sale. Additionally, all of SunCor’s operations are reflected in discontinued operations.

Operating Results — 2010 compared with 2009

Our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for 2010 was $350 million,
compared with $68 million for the comparable prior-year period. The improved results were
primarily due to lower real estate impairment charges recorded in 2010 compared with the prior-year
period by SunCor.



In addition, regulated electricity segment net income increased approximately $82 million from
the prior-year period due to increased revenues related to APS’s retail rate increases and other
factors. Our consolidated results for 2010 also include a gain of $25 million after income taxes
related to the sale of APSES’ district cooling business. The following table presents net income
(loss) attributable to common shareholders by business segment compared with the prior-year period:

Operations and maintenance

Operations and maintenance expenses increased $48 million for the
year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of:

•

An increase of $25 million related to demand-side management and renewable energy
programs, which are primarily offset in operating revenues;

•

An increase of $18 million related to employee benefits costs; and

•

An increase of $5 million related to other miscellaneous factors.



Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses were $8 million higher
for the year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of increased plant in
service partially offset by lower depreciation rates.

Taxes other than income taxes

Taxes other than income taxes increased $12 million for the
year ended 2010 compared with the prior year primarily because of higher property tax rates in the
current year.

Interest charges, net of allowance for funds used during construction

Interest charges, net
of allowance for funds used during construction, decreased $8 million for the year ended 2010
compared with the prior year primarily because of higher rates in the current year for the
allowance for equity and borrowed funds used during construction, partially offset by higher
interest charges due to higher debt balances. Interest charges, net of allowance for funds used
during construction are comprised of the regulated electricity segment portions of the line items
interest expense and allowance for equity and borrowed funds used during construction from the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Income taxes

Income taxes were $19 million higher for the year ended 2010 compared with the
prior year primarily because of higher pretax income in the current-year period, partially offset
by $17 million of income tax benefits related to prior years that were resolved in the current
year. See Note 4.

All other

All other revenues increased $56 million partially offset by increased other expenses of $41
million resulting primarily from improved margins from APSES’ products and services business. In
addition, other income was higher due to investment losses at El Dorado in 2009.

Discontinued Operations

Real estate activities

During the first quarter of 2009, SunCor’s Board of Directors
authorized a series of strategic transactions to dispose of SunCor’s assets. This decision
resulted in impairment charges of approximately $161 million after income taxes in 2009. As of
December 31, 2010, all of SunCor’s operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations
(see Note 22). The after-tax impacts of the $6 million loss from real estate activities for the
year ended 2010 includes real estate impairment charges of approximately $10 million (see Note 23)
and other costs of $6 million, partially offset by a gain from debt restructuring of approximately
$10 million (see Note 6).

All other

All other earnings from discontinued operations were $24 million higher for the
year ended 2010 compared to the prior-year period primarily because of a gain of $25 million after
income taxes related to the sale of APSES’ district cooling business in 2010.

Operating Results — 2009 Compared with 2008

Our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for 2009 was $68 million,
compared with $242 million for the prior year period. The decrease in net income was primarily due
to 2009 real estate impairment charges recorded by SunCor, the Company’s real estate subsidiary.



In addition, regulated electricity segment net income decreased approximately $13 million from
the prior year primarily due to lower retail sales resulting from lower usage per customer; higher
interest charges, net of capitalized financing costs; higher depreciation and amortization
expenses; and the absence of income tax benefits related to prior years recorded in 2008. These
negative factors were partially offset by increased revenues due to an interim rate increase
effective January 1, 2009 and transmission rate increases.

Operations and maintenance

Operations and maintenance expenses increased $66 million for the
year ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily because of:

•

An increase of $62 million related to renewable energy and demand-side management
programs, which are offset in operating revenues;

•

An increase of $29 million in generation costs, including more planned maintenance,
partially offset by lower costs at Palo Verde due to cost efficiency measures; and

•

A decrease of $25 million associated with cost saving measures and other factors,
including the absence of employee severance costs in 2009.



Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $16 million
for the year ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily because of increases in utility
plant in service. The increases in utility plant in service are the result of various improvements
to APS’s existing fossil and nuclear generating plants and distribution and transmission
infrastructure additions and upgrades.

Interest charges, net of allowance for funds used during construction

Interest charges, net
of allowance for funds used during construction increased $27 million for the year ended 2009
compared with the prior year primarily because of higher debt balances, partially offset by the
effects of lower interest rates (see discussion related to APS’s debt issuances in “Pinnacle West
Consolidated — Liquidity and Capital Resources” below). Interest charges, net of allowance for
funds used during construction are comprised of the regulated electricity segment portions of the
line items interest expense and allowance for equity and borrowed funds used during construction
from the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Other income (expenses), net

Other income (expenses), net improved $19 million for the year
ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily because of improved investment gains. Other
income (expenses), net is comprised of the regulated electricity segment portions of the line items
other income and other expense from the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Income taxes

Income taxes were $50 million higher for the year ended 2009 compared with the
prior year primarily because of $30 million of income tax benefits related to prior years recorded
in 2008 and higher pretax income. See Note 4.

All other

All other earnings from continuing operations were $15 million lower for the year ended 2009
compared with the prior year primarily because of planned reductions of marketing and trading
activities.

Discontinued operations

Real estate activities

During the first quarter of 2009, we decided to sell substantially all
of SunCor’s assets to reduce its outstanding debt. The loss from real estate activities
attributable to common shareholders was $141 million higher for the year ended 2009 compared with
the prior year primarily because of an increase in real estate impairment charges of $213 million
before income taxes (see Note 23 for details of the impairment charges).

All other

All other earnings from discontinued operations were $5 million lower for the year
ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily because of the absence of the 2008 resolution of
certain tax issues associated with the sale of Silverhawk in 2005.

2010 Compared with 2009

The decrease of approximately $317 million in net cash provided by operating activities is
primarily due to voluntary pension contributions in 2010 of approximately $200 million, changes in
collateral and margin cash provided as a result of changes in commodity prices and other changes in
working capital.

The decrease of approximately $129 million in net cash used for investing activities is
primarily due to approximately $100 million of proceeds from the sale of the district cooling
business in June 2010 and the increase in proceeds from the sale of commercial real estate
investments of approximately $29 million.

The decrease of approximately $113 million in net cash used for financing activities is
primarily due to lower repayments of short-term borrowings in 2010 due to lower short-term debt
balances partially offset by lower net sources of equity and long-term debt financing, including
the proceeds of approximately $253 million from the issuance of equity in April 2010 and APS’s
issuance of $500 million of unsecured senior notes in 2009.

2009 Compared with 2008

The increase of approximately $219 million in net cash provided by operating activities is
primarily due to a reduction of collateral and margin cash required as a result of changes in
commodity prices and a 2009 income tax refund (see Note 4).

The decrease of approximately $110 million in net cash used for investing activities is
primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures net of contributions (see table and
discussion below), partially offset by lower real estate sales primarily due to a commercial
property sale in 2008.

The increase of approximately $338 million in net cash used for financing activities is
primarily due to repayments of short-term borrowings, partially offset by APS’s issuance of $500
million of unsecured senior notes.

2010 Compared with 2009

The decrease of approximately $300 million in net cash provided by operating activities is
primarily due to voluntary pension contributions in 2010 of approximately $200 million, increased
collateral and margin cash provided as a result of changes in commodity prices, and the payment of
income taxes in 2010. These were partially offset by other changes in working capital.

The increase of approximately $9 million in net cash used for investing activities is
primarily due to lower contributions in aid of construction and other cash flows.

The decrease of approximately $239 million in net cash used for financing activities is
primarily due to the repayment of short-term borrowings in 2009, partially offset by lower net
sources of equity and long-term debt financing including the proceeds of approximately $253 million
from the infusion of equity from Pinnacle West in 2010 and by APS’s issuance of $500 million of
unsecured senior notes in 2009.

2009 Compared with 2008

The increase of approximately $175 million in net cash provided by operating activities is
primarily due to a reduction of collateral and margin cash required as a result of changes in
commodity prices.

The decrease of approximately $141 million in net cash used for investing activities is
primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures net of contributions.

The increase of approximately $287 million in net cash used for financing activities is
primarily due to repayments of short-term borrowings, partially offset by APS’s issuance of $500

(a)

Primarily information systems and facilities projects.

Generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to APS’s existing fossil
and nuclear plants. Examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions,
upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment, such as turbines, boilers and
environmental equipment. Included under Renewables is the AZ Sun Program, which is a significant
component of the increase in capital expenditures from 2010 to 2011. For purposes of this table,
we have assumed the consummation of APS’s purchase of SCE’s interest in Four Corners Units 4 and 5
and the subsequent shut down of Units 1-3, as discussed in the “Overview” section above. As a
result, we included the $294 million purchase price under Generation and have not included
environmental expenditures for Units 1-3. We are also monitoring the status of certain
environmental matters, which, depending on their final outcome, could require modification to our
environmental expenditures. (See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Environmental
Matters — EPA Environmental Regulation — Regional Haze Rules, Mercury and Other Hazardous Air
Pollutants and Coal Combustion Waste” in Item 1.)

Distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions
and upgrades, capital replacements, new customer construction, related information systems and
facility costs. Examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines,
substations, line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to
customer information systems.

Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings,
which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock.



Pinnacle West (Parent Company)

Our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest
payments on our short-term and long-term debt. The level of our common stock dividends and future
dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, payout
ratio trends, free cash flow and financial market conditions.

On January 19, 2011, the Pinnacle West Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of
$0.525 per share of common stock, payable on March 1, 2011, to shareholders of record on February
1, 2011.

Our primary sources of cash are dividends from APS, external debt and equity financings. For
the years 2008 through 2010, total distributions from APS were $522 million and there were no
distributions from SunCor. For 2010, cash distributions from APS were $182 million.

An existing ACC order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40%. As
defined in the ACC order, the common equity ratio is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of
total shareholder equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt. At
December 31, 2010, APS’s common equity ratio, as defined, was 53%. Its total shareholder equity
was approximately $3.8 billion, and total capitalization was approximately $7.2 billion. APS would
be prohibited from paying dividends if the payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below
approximately $2.9 billion, assuming APS’s total capitalization remains the same. Based on the
discussion above, this restriction does not materially affect Pinnacle West’s ability to meet its
ongoing capital requirements.

Pinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities in order to enhance
liquidity and provide credit support for the commercial paper programs. During the first quarter
of 2010, Pinnacle West and APS refinanced existing credit facilities that would have otherwise
matured in December 2010.

On February 12, 2010, Pinnacle West refinanced its $283 million revolving credit facility that
would have matured in December 2010, and decreased the size of the facility to $200 million. The
new facility matures in February 2013. Pinnacle West has the option to increase the amount of the
facility up to a maximum of $300 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the
consent of the lenders. Pinnacle West will use the facility for general corporate purposes,
commercial paper program support and for the issuance of letters of credit. Interest rates are
based on Pinnacle West’s senior unsecured debt credit ratings. As a result of the downsized credit
facility, the Company also reduced the size of its commercial paper program to $200 million from
$250 million.

At December 31, 2010, the $200 million credit facility was available to support the issuance
of up to $183 million in commercial paper or for bank borrowings, including issuances of letters of
credit up to $183 million. At December 31, 2010, Pinnacle West had no outstanding borrowings under
this credit facility, $17 million of commercial paper borrowings and no outstanding letters of
credit.



In April 2010, Pinnacle West issued 6,900,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of
$38.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $253 million. Pinnacle West
contributed all of the net proceeds from this offering into APS in the form of equity infusions.
APS has used these
contributions to repay short-term indebtedness, to finance capital expenditures and for other
general corporate purposes. Pinnacle West intends to issue equity to provide most of the funds for
the equity infusions into APS required by the retail rate case settlement. Such equity issuances
may occur at any time in the period through 2014, at Pinnacle West’s discretion. See Note 3.

In June 2010, Pinnacle West received approximately $100 million related to the sale of APSES’
district cooling business. The net proceeds were used to repay short-term indebtedness.

Pinnacle West expects to receive approximately $132 million of cash tax benefits related to
SunCor’s strategic asset sales (see Note 23), a majority of which have been realized as of December
31, 2010. Approximately $7 million of these benefits were recorded in 2010 as reductions to income
tax expense related to the current impairment charges. The additional $125 million of tax benefits
were recorded as reductions to income tax expense related to SunCor impairment charges recorded on
or before December 31, 2009.

The $68 million income tax receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represent the
anticipated refunds related to an APS tax accounting method change approved by the IRS in the third
quarter of 2009 and the current year tax benefits related to the SunCor strategic asset sales that
closed in 2010.

The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 includes
provisions making qualified property placed into service after September 8, 2010 and before January
1, 2012 eligible for 100% bonus depreciation for federal income tax purposes. In addition,
qualified property placed into service in 2012 is eligible for 50% bonus depreciation for federal
income tax purposes. These provisions of the recent tax legislation are expected to generate
approximately $450-500 million of cash tax benefits for APS through accelerated depreciation. It
is anticipated that these cash benefits will be fully realized by APS by the end of 2013, with a
majority of the benefit realized in 2012 and 2013. The cash generated is an acceleration of tax
benefits that APS would have otherwise received over 20 years.

Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a
non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and
our subsidiaries. IRS regulations require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan.
We contribute at least the minimum amount required under IRS regulations, but no more than the
maximum tax-deductible amount. The minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of
plan assets and our pension obligation. The assets in the plan are comprised of fixed-income,
equity, real estate, and short-term investments. Future year contribution amounts are dependent on
plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions. During 2010, we made voluntary
contributions of $200 million to our pension plan. The required minimum contribution to our
pension plan is zero in 2011 and approximately $85 million in 2012. The contribution to our other
postretirement benefit plans in 2010 was approximately $17 million. The contributions to our other
postretirement benefit plans for 2011 and 2012 are expected to be approximately $20 million each
year. APS and other subsidiaries fund their share of the contributions. APS’s share is
approximately 98% of both plans.



APS

APS’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of
long-term debt. APS funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and, to the extent
necessary, external debt financing and equity infusions from Pinnacle West. See “Pinnacle West
(Parent Company)” above for a discussion of the common equity ratio that APS must maintain in order
to pay dividends to Pinnacle West.

On February 12, 2010, APS refinanced its $377 million credit facility that would have matured
in December 2010, and increased the size of the facility to $500 million. The new credit facility
terminates in February 2013. APS may increase the amount of the facility up to a maximum of $700
million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of the lenders. APS will
use the facility for general corporate purposes, commercial paper program support and for the
issuance of letters of credit. Interest rates are based on APS’s senior unsecured debt credit
ratings.

On February 14, 2011, APS refinanced its $489 million credit facility that would have matured
in September 2011, and increased the size of the facility to $500 million. The new credit facility
terminates in February 2015. APS may increase the amount of the facility up to a maximum of $700
million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of the lenders. APS will
use the facility for general corporate purposes, commercial paper program support and for the
issuance of letters of credit. Interest rates are based on APS’s senior unsecured debt credit
ratings.

At December 31, 2010, APS had two credit facilities totaling $989 million, consisting of the
$500 million and $489 million credit facilities described above. These facilities were available
either to support the issuance of up to $250 million in commercial paper, or for bank borrowings,
including issuances of letters of credit up to $989 million. At December 31, 2010, APS had no
borrowings outstanding under any of its credit facilities and no outstanding commercial paper. A
$20 million letter of credit was issued under APS’s $489 million credit facility in the second
quarter of 2010.

On July 13, 2010, APS changed the interest rate mode for the approximately $33 million of
Coconino County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Arizona
Public Service Company Navajo Project) 1994 Series A, due 2029. The rate period for the bonds
changed from a daily rate mode, supported by a letter of credit, to a three-year term rate mode
that will bear interest at a rate of 3.625% per annum for three years. The letter of credit was
terminated in connection with this change, and there is no bank or other third-party credit support
for the bonds in the term rate mode.

On August 10, 2010, APS changed the letter of credit supporting the approximately $17 million
of Coconino County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Arizona
Public Service Company Project) Series 1998, due 2033. The bonds were in a daily rate mode
supported by a prior letter of credit and remain in a daily rate mode, supported by a new
three-year letter of credit expiring in August 2013.



On October 12, 2010, APS changed the interest rate mode for the approximately $147 million of
City of Farmington, New Mexico Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds (Arizona Public Service
Company Four Corners Project) 1994 Series A and 1994 Series B, due 2024 and City of Farmington, New
Mexico Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Arizona Public Service Company Four Corners Project) 1994
Series C, due 2024. The rate period for the 1994 Series A bonds and the 1994 Series B bonds
changed from a daily rate mode, supported by letters of credit, to a term rate mode to
maturity, subject to optional redemption after year ten, that will bear interest at a rate of
4.70% per annum until maturity in 2024 unless the optional redemption is exercised by APS. The
rate period for the 1994 Series C bonds changed from a daily rate mode, supported by a letter of
credit, to a three-year term rate mode that will bear interest at a rate of 2.875% per annum until
October 2013. The letters of credit supporting each of these three series of bonds were terminated
in connection with these changes, and there is no bank or other third-party credit support for any
of these bonds.

On January 1, 2010, due to the adoption of amended accounting guidance relating to VIEs, APS
began consolidating the Palo Verde Lessor Trusts (see Note 20) and, as a result of consolidation of
these VIEs, APS has reported the Lessor Trusts’ long-term debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Interest rates on these debt instruments are 8% and are fixed for the remaining life of the debt.
As of December 31, 2010 approximately $29 million was classified as current maturities of long-term
debt and $97 million was classified as long-term debt relating to these VIEs. These debt
instruments mature on December 30, 2015 and have sinking fund features that are serviced by the
lease payments. See Note 20 for additional discussion of the VIEs.

Other Financing Matters —

See Note 3 for information regarding the PSA approved by the ACC.
Although APS defers actual retail fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis, APS’s recovery
of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual and, if necessary, periodic PSA
adjustments.

See Note 3 for information regarding the retail rate case settlement, which includes ACC
authorization and requirements of equity infusions into APS of at least $700 million by December
31, 2014.

See Note 18 for information related to the change in our margin accounts.

Other Subsidiaries

SunCor

—In 2010, SunCor sold land parcels, commercial assets and master planned home-building
communities for approximately $72 million, which approximated the carrying value of these assets,
resulting in a net gain of zero. In connection with these sales, SunCor negotiated a restructuring
of certain of its credit facilities. The debt restructuring resulted in an after-tax gain of
approximately $10 million. At December 31, 2010, SunCor had total remaining assets of about $16
million, which includes approximately $3 million of assets held for sale. At December 31, 2010,
SunCor had no debt outstanding.

El Dorado

— El Dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and
intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments.

APSES

—APSES expects minimal capital expenditures over the next three years.

Debt Provisions

Pinnacle West’s and APS’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing
arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios. Pinnacle West and APS comply with this
covenant and each anticipates it will continue to meet this and other significant covenant
requirements. For both Pinnacle West and APS, this covenant requires that the ratio of
consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65%. At December 31, 2010, the
ratio was approximately 49%
for Pinnacle West and 46% for APS. Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an
event of default which, generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt
subject to the covenants and could cross-default other debt. See further discussion of
“cross-default” provisions below.



Neither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would
result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating
downgrade. However, our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates
we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings.

All of Pinnacle West’s loan agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in
defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or
APS were to default under certain other material agreements. All of APS’s bank agreements contain
cross-default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment
under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.
Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facilities
borrowings.

See Notes 5 and 6 for further discussions of liquidity matters.

Credit Ratings

The ratings of securities of Pinnacle West and APS as of February 17, 2011 are shown below.
The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies, from which an explanation of the
significance of their ratings may be obtained. There is no assurance that these ratings will
continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the
rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Any downward revision
or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West’s or APS’s securities and/or
result in an increase in the cost of, or limit access to, capital. Such revisions may also result
in substantial additional cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative
instruments, insurance policies, natural gas transportation, fuel supply, and other energy-related
contracts. At this time, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to cover a downward revision to
our credit ratings.

registration.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

On January 1, 2010 we adopted amended accounting guidance relating to VIEs and, as a result,
we have consolidated certain entities which were previously not consolidated. The consolidation of
these entities has impacted our consolidated financial statements. See Notes 1, 2 and 20 for a
discussion of these impacts.

Guarantees and Surety Bonds

We have issued parental guarantees and obtained surety bonds on behalf of our subsidiaries
including credit support instruments enabling APSES to offer energy-related products and surety
bonds at APS, principally related to self-insured workers’ compensation. Non-performance or
non-payment under the underlying contract by our subsidiaries would result in a payment liability
on our part under the guarantee or surety bond. No liability is currently recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets related to such instruments. At December 31, 2010, we had no
outstanding claims for payment under any of these instruments. Our guarantees and surety bonds
have no recourse or collateral provisions to allow us to recover amounts paid under these
instruments or surety bonds from our subsidiaries. We generally agree to indemnification
provisions related to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements, with
limited exceptions depending on the particular agreement. See Note 21 for additional information
regarding guarantees and letters of credit.

These contractual obligations include commitments for capital expenditures and other
obligations. These amounts do not include the purchase of SCE’s interest in Four Corners
Units 4 and 5 due to additional approvals required. See discussion in “Overview.”

This table excludes $133 million in unrecognized tax benefits because the timing of the future
cash outflows is uncertain. This table also excludes $85 million in estimated minimum pension
contributions in 2012 (see Note 8).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management must often make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting
period. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ
from those estimates.
We consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the
uncertainties, judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations
involved.



Regulatory Accounting

Regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators, such as the ACC and the FERC, to
be reflected in our financial statements. Their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that
would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies.
Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of
future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future
costs that have already been collected from customers. Management continually assesses whether our
regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable
regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same
jurisdiction. This determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in the
state and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable,
the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings. We had $1.0 billion of
regulatory assets and $753 million of regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
December 31, 2010.

Included in the balance of regulatory assets at December 31, 2010 is a regulatory asset of
$669 million for pension and other postretirement benefits. This regulatory asset represents the
future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings. If
these costs are disallowed by the ACC, this regulatory asset would be charged to OCI and result in
lower future earnings.

See Notes 1 and 3 for more information.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting

Changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement
benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position.
The most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and
net periodic cost, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings
on invested funds over the long-term, and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates. We review these
assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.



The following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions
would have had on the December 31, 2010 reported pension liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and our 2010 reported pension expense,
after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed
to electric plant participants, on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income (dollars in

See Note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.



Derivative Accounting

Derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying
interpretations. Our evaluation of these rules, as they apply to our contracts, determines whether
we use accrual accounting (for contracts designated as normal) or fair value (mark-to-market)
accounting. Mark-to-market accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized
periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met. For cash flow hedges, the effective
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock equity (as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss)) and the ineffective portion is recognized in
current earnings.

See “Market Risks — Commodity Price Risk” below for quantitative analysis. See “Fair Value
Measurements” below for additional information on valuation. See Note 1 for discussion on
accounting policies and Note 18 for a further discussion on derivative accounting.

Fair Value Measurements

We apply recurring fair value measurements to derivative instruments, nuclear decommissioning
trusts, certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We use inputs, or
assumptions that market participants would use, to determine fair market value. The significance of
a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in the fair value hierarchy. We
utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs. The determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex
judgment. Our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value
measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within the fair value
hierarchy. Actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value. See Note 14 for further
fair value measurement discussion, Note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and Note 18 for a
further discussion on derivative accounting.

Our nuclear decommissioning trusts invest in fixed income securities and equity securities.
The fair values of these securities are based on observable inputs for identical or similar assets.
See Note 14 for further discussion of our nuclear decommissioning trusts.

Real Estate Investment Impairments

While we do not have any real estate investments or home inventory at December 31, 2010, we
did have real estate investments of $120 million and $3 million of home inventory on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009. For purposes of evaluating impairment, in
accordance with guidance on the impairment and disposal of long-lived assets, we classified our
real estate assets, such as land under development, land held for future development, and
commercial property, as “held and used.” When events or changes in circumstances indicated that
the carrying value of real estate assets considered held and used were not recoverable, we compared
the undiscounted cash flows that we estimated would be generated by each asset to its carrying
amount. If the carrying amount exceeded the undiscounted cash flows, we adjusted the asset to fair
value and recognized an impairment charge. The adjusted value became the new book value (carrying
amount) for held and used assets. We may have had real estate assets classified as held and used
with fair values that were lower than their carrying amounts, but were not deemed to be impaired
because the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amounts.



Real estate home inventory was considered to be held for sale for the purposes of evaluating
impairment. Home inventories were reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost
to sell. Fair value less cost to sell was evaluated each period to determine if it had changed.
Losses (and gains not to exceed any cumulative loss previously recognized) were reported as
adjustments to the carrying amount.

We determined fair value for our real estate assets primarily based on the future cash flows
that we estimated would be generated by each asset discounted for market risk. Our impairment
assessments and fair value determinations required significant judgment regarding key assumptions
such as future sales prices, future construction and land development costs, future sales timing,
and discount rates. The assumptions were specific to each project and may have varied among
projects. The discount rates we used to determine fair values at December 31, 2009 ranged from 11%
to 29%. Due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process, with regard to
impairments, it is possible that actual results could have differed from those estimates.

OTHER ACCOUNTING MATTERS

On January 1, 2010 we adopted amended accounting guidance relating to VIEs and, as a
result, we have consolidated certain entities which were previously not consolidated. The
consolidation of these entities has impacted our consolidated financial statements. See Notes 1, 2
and 20 for a discussion of these impacts.

The FASB is currently working on several significant projects with the desire to converge GAAP
with IFRS. These projects include accounting for leases, revenue recognition, and financial
instruments, among other items. Concurrently, the SEC is considering mandating IFRS for U.S.
companies. See Note 2 for a discussion of these potential changes.

MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS

Market Risks

Our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates, commodity
prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund.

Interest Rate and Equity Risk

We have exposure to changing interest rates. Changing interest rates will affect interest
paid on variable-rate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear
decommissioning trust fund (see Note 14). The nuclear decommissioning trust fund also has risks
associated with the changing market value of its investments. Nuclear decommissioning costs are
recovered in regulated electricity prices.



The tables below present contractual balances of our consolidated long-term and short-term
debt at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair value of those instruments on December 31,
2010 and 2009. The interest rates presented in the tables below represent the weighted-average

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity and natural gas. Our risk management committee, consisting of officers and
key management personnel, oversees company-wide energy risk management activities to ensure
compliance with our stated energy risk management policies. We manage risks associated with these
market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives,
including exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options and swaps. As
part of our risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of
electricity and fuels. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to
price changes in the hedged commodities.



The following table shows the net pretax changes in mark-to-market of our derivative positions

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

(PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION)

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), for Pinnacle West
Capital Corporation. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework,

our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has
been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report which is included herein and also relates to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

February 18, 2011



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Pinnacle West Capital Corporation

Phoenix, Arizona

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation
and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the
Index at Item 15. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules and an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

As disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted amended
accounting guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities on January 1, 2010.

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation and Nature of Operations

Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Pinnacle West and
our subsidiaries: APS, SunCor, APSES, El Dorado and Pinnacle West Marketing & Trading. APS’s
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of APS and the Palo Verde sale leaseback
VIEs. Intercompany accounts and transactions between the consolidated companies have been
eliminated.

APS is a vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale
electric service to substantially all of the state of Arizona, with the major exceptions of about
one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson metropolitan area and Mohave County in
northwestern Arizona. APS accounts for substantially all of our revenues and earnings, and is
expected to continue to do so. SunCor was a developer of residential, commercial and industrial
real estate projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho and Utah. All activities for SunCor are now
reported as discontinued operations (see Note 22). APSES provides energy-related projects to
commercial and industrial retail customers in competitive markets in the western United States. In
2008, APSES discontinued its commodity-related energy services (see Note 22). El Dorado is an
investment firm. Pinnacle West Marketing & Trading began operations in early 2007. These
operations were previously conducted by a division of Pinnacle West through the end of 2006. By
the end of 2008, substantially all the contracts were transferred to APS or expired.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we have evaluated the events that have
occurred after December 31, 2010 through the date the financial statements were issued.

Our consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments except as otherwise disclosed in the notes) that we believe are necessary
for the fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the
periods presented. These consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared
consistently with the exception of the reclassification of certain prior year amounts on our
Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with accounting
requirements for reporting discontinued operations (see Note 22), and amended accounting guidance
related to VIEs (see Note 2).

Certain line items are presented in more detail on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
than was presented in the prior years. Other line items are more condensed than the previous
presentation. The prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on total net cash flow provided by operating
activities.

Accounting Records and Use of Estimates

Our accounting records are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Derivative Accounting

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity and natural gas. We manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by
utilizing various instruments that qualify as derivatives, including exchange-traded futures and
options and over-the-counter forwards, options and swaps. As part of our overall risk management
program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels. The
changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged
transactions.

We account for our derivative contracts in accordance with derivatives and hedging guidance,
which requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the
balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. See Note 18 for additional information
about our derivative accounting policies.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Fair Value Measurements

We determine and disclose the fair value of certain assets and liabilities in accordance with
fair value guidance. Fair value is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability
(exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an
orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date. Inputs to fair
value include observable and unobservable data. We maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

We determine fair market value using actively-quoted prices for identical instruments when
available. When actively quoted prices are not available for the identical instruments we use
prices for similar instruments or other corroborative market information or prices provided by
other external sources. For options, long-term contracts and other contracts for which price
quotes are not available, we use unobservable inputs, such as models and other valuation methods,
to determine fair market value.

The use of models and other valuation methods to determine fair market value often requires
subjective and complex judgment. Actual results could differ from the results estimated through
application of these methods. Our structured activities are hedged with a portfolio of forward
purchases that protects the economic value of the sales transactions. Our practice is to hedge
within timeframes established by our executive risk committee.

See Note 14 for additional information about fair value measurements.

Regulatory Accounting

APS is regulated by the ACC and the FERC. The accompanying financial statements reflect the
rate-making policies of these commissions. As a result, we capitalize certain costs that would be
included as expense in the current period by unregulated companies. Regulatory assets represent
incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer
rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been
collected from customers.

Management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery
by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory environment and recent rate
orders applicable to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction. This determination
reflects the current political and regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the
future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a
charge in current period earnings.

See Note 3 for additional information.

Utility Plant and Depreciation

Utility plant is the term we use to describe the business property and equipment that supports
electric service, consisting primarily of generation, transmission and distribution facilities. We
report utility plant at its original cost, which includes:

•

material and labor;

•

contractor costs;

•

capitalized leases;

•

construction overhead costs (where applicable); and

•

capitalized interest or an allowance for funds used during construction.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We expense the costs of plant outages, major maintenance and routine maintenance as incurred.
We charge retired utility plant to accumulated depreciation. Liabilities associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets are recognized at fair value as incurred and capitalized
as part of the related tangible long-lived assets. Accretion of the liability due to the passage
of time is an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the
long-lived asset. See Note 12.

APS records a regulatory liability for the asset retirement obligations related to its
regulated assets. This regulatory liability represents the difference between the amount that has
been recovered in regulated rates and the amount calculated in accordance with guidance on
accounting for asset retirement obligations. APS believes it can recover in regulated rates the
costs capitalized in accordance with this accounting guidance.

We record depreciation on utility plant on a straight-line basis over the remaining useful
life of the related assets. The approximate remaining average useful lives of our utility property
at December 31, 2010 were as follows:

•

Fossil plant — 18 years;

•

Nuclear plant — 17 years;

•

Other generation — 25 years;

•

Transmission — 40 years;

•

Distribution — 35 years; and

•

Other — 7 years.

For the years 2008 through 2010, the depreciation rates ranged from a low of 1.30% to a high
of 10.20%. The weighted-average rate was 2.98% for 2010, 3.06% for 2009 and 3.08% for 2008. We
depreciate non-utility property and equipment over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets, ranging from 3 to 34 years.

Investments

El Dorado accounts for its investments using either the equity method (if significant
influence) or the cost method (if less than 20% ownership).

Our investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund are accounted for in accordance with
guidance on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. See Note 14 for more
information on these investments.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

AFUDC represents the approximate net composite interest cost of borrowed funds and an allowed
return on the equity funds used for construction of regulated utility plant. Both the debt and
equity components of AFUDC are non-cash amounts within the Consolidated Statement of Income. Plant
construction costs, including AFUDC, are recovered in authorized rates through depreciation when
completed projects are placed into commercial operation.

AFUDC was calculated by using a composite rate of 9.2% for 2010, 5.9% for 2009 and 7.0% for
2008. APS compounds AFUDC monthly and ceases to accrue AFUDC when construction work is completed
and the property is placed in service.

Electric Revenues

We derive electric revenues primarily from sales of electricity to our regulated Native Load
customers. Revenues related to the sale of electricity are generally recorded when service is
rendered or electricity is delivered to customers. The billing of electricity sales to individual
Native Load customers is based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis
throughout the month. Unbilled revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue/kWh to the
number of estimated kWhs delivered but not billed. Differences historically between the actual and
estimated unbilled revenues are immaterial. We exclude sales taxes and franchise fees on electric
revenues from both revenue and taxes other than income taxes.

Revenues from our Native Load customers and non-derivative instruments are reported on a gross
basis on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income. In the electricity business, some
contracts to purchase energy are netted against other contracts to sell energy. This is called a
“book-out” and usually occurs for contracts that have the same terms (quantities and delivery
points) and for which power does not flow. We net these book-outs, which reduces both revenues and
fuel and purchased power costs.

Effective January 1, 2010, electric revenues also include proceeds for line extension payments
for new or upgraded service in accordance with the 2009 retail rate case settlement agreement (see
Note 3). This revenue treatment continues through 2012, or until new rates are established in
APS’s next general retail rate case, if that is before year end 2012. Certain proceeds received
under previous versions of the line extension policy, or for activities not involving an extension
or upgrade of service (e.g., service relocations at the request of governmental entities or
undergrounding of overhead facilities) will continue to be treated as contributions in aid of
construction and will not impact electric revenues.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of existing accounts
receivable that will ultimately be uncollectible. The allowance is calculated by applying
estimated write-off factors to various classes of outstanding receivables, including accrued
utility revenues. The write-off factors used to estimate uncollectible accounts are based upon
consideration of both historical collections experience and management’s best estimate of future
collections success given the existing collections environment.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Real Estate Investments

Real estate investments primarily included SunCor’s land, home inventory, commercial property
and investments in joint ventures. Land included acquisition costs, infrastructure costs,
capitalized interest and property taxes directly associated with the acquisition and development of
each project. Home inventory consisted of construction costs, improved lot costs, capitalized
interest and property taxes on homes and condos under construction. Homes under construction were
classified as “real estate investments” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; upon completion of
construction they transferred to “home inventory” with the expectation that they would be sold in a
timely manner.

For the purposes of evaluating impairment, in accordance with the provisions on accounting for
the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, we classified our real estate assets, such as land
under development, land held for future development, and commercial property as “held and used.”
When events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying values of real estate assets
considered held and used would not be recoverable, we compared the undiscounted cash flows that we
estimated would be generated by each asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeded
the undiscounted cash flows, we adjusted the asset to fair value and recognized an impairment
charge. The adjusted value became the new book value (carrying amount) for held and used assets.
Our internal models used inputs that we believe were consistent with those that would be used by
market participants.

Real estate home inventory was considered to be held for sale for purposes of evaluating
impairment in accordance with the provisions of accounting guidance for impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets. Home inventories were reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value
less costs to sell. Fair value less costs to sell was evaluated each period to determine if it had
changed. Losses (and gains not to exceed any cumulative loss previously recognized) were reported
as adjustments to the carrying amount.

Investments in joint ventures for which SunCor did not have a controlling financial interest
were not consolidated, but were accounted for using the equity method of accounting. In addition,
see Note 22 and Note 23.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at
acquisition to be cash equivalents.

Nuclear Fuel

APS amortizes nuclear fuel by using the unit-of-production method. The unit-of-production
method is based on actual physical usage. APS divides the cost of the fuel by the estimated number
of thermal units it expects to produce with that fuel. APS then multiplies that rate by the number
of thermal units produced within the current period. This calculation determines the current
period nuclear fuel expense.

APS also charges nuclear fuel expense for the interim storage and permanent disposal of spent
nuclear fuel. The DOE is responsible for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and charges
APS $0.001 per kWh of nuclear generation. See Note 11 for information on spent nuclear fuel
disposal and Note 14 for information on nuclear decommissioning costs.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability approach prescribed by guidance
relating to accounting for income taxes. We file our federal income tax return on a consolidated
basis and we file our state income tax returns on a consolidated or unitary basis. In accordance
with our intercompany tax sharing agreement, federal and state income taxes are allocated to each
first-tier subsidiary as though each first-tier subsidiary filed a separate income tax return. Any
difference between that method and the consolidated (and unitary) income tax liability is
attributed to the parent company. The income tax liability accounts reflect the tax and interest
associated with management’s estimate of the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50%
likely of being realized upon settlement for all known and measurable tax exposures. See Note 4.

Intangible Assets

We have no goodwill recorded and have separately disclosed other intangible assets, primarily
APS’s software, on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The intangible assets are
amortized over their finite useful lives. Amortization expense was $45 million in 2010, $35
million in 2009 and $33 million in 2008. Estimated amortization expense on existing intangible
assets over the next five years is $40 million in 2011, $36 million in 2012, $29 million in 2013,
$23 million in 2014 and $15 million in 2015. At December 31, 2010, the weighted average remaining
amortization period for intangible assets was 7 years.

2. New Accounting Standards

Variable Interest Entities

On January 1, 2010 we adopted amended accounting guidance relating to the consolidation of
VIEs. This amended guidance significantly changed the consolidation model for VIEs. Under the
prior guidance the consolidation model considered risk absorption using a quantitative approach
when determining the primary beneficiary. The consolidation model under the new guidance requires
a qualitative assessment and focuses on the power to direct activities of the VIE when determining
the primary beneficiary. As a result of applying this qualitative assessment, we have determined
that APS is the primary beneficiary of certain VIEs relating to the Palo Verde Unit 2 sale
leaseback transactions, and is therefore required to consolidate these VIEs. Prior to adopting
this new guidance, APS was not considered the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and did not
consolidate these entities. We have adopted this guidance using retrospective application and have
adjusted prior periods presented to reflect consolidation of the VIEs in those periods (see Note
1). See Note 20 for additional discussion and disclosures.

Future Accounting Changes

The FASB is currently working on several projects with the desire to converge GAAP with IFRS.
These projects include accounting for leases, revenue recognition, and financial instruments, among
other items. The FASB’s standard-setting process is ongoing and until new standards have been
finalized and issued, we cannot determine the impact on our financial statements that may result
from any such future changes.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Concurrent with these convergence projects, the SEC is considering mandating IFRS for U.S.
companies. At this time, the impacts and timing of potential conversion to IFRS are uncertain and
cannot be determined until final conversion requirements are mandated. The potential preparation of
our financial statements in accordance with IFRS could have a significant impact on our reported
financial statement results.

3. Regulatory Matters

2008 General Retail Rate Case Impacts

On December 30, 2009, the ACC issued an order approving a settlement agreement entered into by
APS and twenty-one other parties to its general retail rate case, which was originally filed in
March 2008. The settlement agreement included a net retail rate increase of $207.5 million, which
represented a base rate increase of $344.7 million less a reclassification of $137.2 million of
fuel and purchased power revenues from the then-existing PSA to base rates. The new rates were
effective January 1, 2010. The settlement agreement also contained on-going requirements,
commitments and authorizations, including the following:

•

Revenue accounting treatment for line extension payments received for new or
upgraded service from January 1, 2010 through year end 2012 (or until new rates are
established in APS’s next general rate case, if that is before the end of 2012);

•

An authorized return on common equity of 11%;

•

A capital structure comprised of 46.2% debt and 53.8% common equity;

•

A commitment from APS to reduce average annual operational expenses by at least $30
million from 2010 through 2014;

•

Authorization and requirements of equity infusions into APS of at least $700 million
during the period beginning June 1, 2009 through December 31, 2014 ($253 million of
which was infused into APS from proceeds of a Pinnacle West equity issuance in the
second quarter of 2010); and

•

Various modifications to the existing energy efficiency, demand-side management and
renewable energy programs that require APS to, among other things, expand its
conservation and demand-side management programs and its use of renewable energy, as
well as allow for concurrent recovery of renewable energy expenses and provide for more
concurrent recovery of demand-side management costs and incentives.

The parties also agreed to a rate case filing plan in which APS is prohibited from filing its
next two general rate cases until on or after June 1, 2011 and June 1, 2013, respectively, unless
certain extraordinary events occur. Subject to the foregoing, APS may not request its next general
retail rate increase to be effective prior to July 1, 2012. On February 1, 2011, APS filed a
120-day advanced notice of its intent to file its next rate case on June 1, 2011. The parties
agreed to use good faith efforts to process these subsequent rate cases within twelve months of
sufficiency findings from the ACC staff, which generally occur within 30 days after the filing of a
rate case.

Cost Recovery Mechanisms

APS has received regulatory decisions that allow for more timely recovery of certain costs
through the following recovery mechanisms.

Renewable Energy Standard.

In 2006, the ACC approved the RES. Under the RES, electric
utilities that are regulated by the ACC must supply an increasing percentage of their retail
electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources, including solar, wind, biomass, biogas and
geothermal technologies. In order to achieve these requirements, the ACC allows APS to include a
RES surcharge as part of customer bills to recover the approved amounts for use on renewable energy
projects. Each year APS is required to file a five-year implementation plan with the ACC and seek
approval for funding the upcoming year’s RES budget.

During 2009, APS filed its annual RES implementation plan, covering the 2010-2014 timeframe
and requesting 2010 RES funding approval. The plan provided for the acquisition of renewable
generation in compliance with requirements through 2014, and requested RES funding of $87 million
for 2010, which was later approved by the ACC. APS also sought various other determinations in its
plan, including approval of the AZ Sun Program and the Community Power Project in Flagstaff,
Arizona described below.

On March 3, 2010, the ACC approved the AZ Sun Program, which contemplates the addition of 100
MW of APS-owned solar resources through 2014. Through this program, APS plans to invest up to $500
million in solar photovoltaic projects across Arizona, which APS will acquire through competitive
procurement processes. The costs associated with the first 50 MW under this program will be
recovered initially through the RES until such time as the costs are recovered in base rates or
other mechanisms. The costs of the second 50 MW will be recovered through a mechanism to be
determined in APS’s next retail rate case.

On April 1, 2010, the ACC approved the Community Power Project, a pilot program in which APS
will own, operate and receive energy from approximately 1.5 MW of solar panels on the rooftops of
up to 200 residential and business customers located within a certain test area in Flagstaff,
Arizona. The capital carrying costs of the program will be recovered through the RES until such
time as these costs are recovered in base rates.

On July 1, 2010, APS filed its annual RES implementation plan, covering the 2011-2015
timeframe and requesting 2011 RES funding of $96 million. The 2011 Plan addressed
enhancements to the residential distributed energy incentive program based on high customer
participation, among other things. On October 13, 2010, APS filed an adjusted RES implementation
plan to reflect the following items, among others: 1) increased clarity relating to customer
project in-service dates and related budget revisions; 2) AZ Sun Program updates; and 3) the
addition of 10 MW of biomass capacity. On December 10, 2010, the ACC approved the 2011 Plan
and associated funding request. In January 2011, the ACC voted to reconsider four aspects of the
approved 2011 Plan, including: (a) approval to proceed with a feed-in tariff filing; (b) approval
for APS to participate in the ownership of distributed energy facilities in the Schools and
Government program; (c) denial of a Rapid Reservation program that allows customers to receive
priority in the incentive reservation process in exchange for receipt of a reduced incentive
amount; and (d) allocation of the budget among various programs and studies. Hearings were held on
January 24, 2011 and January 28, 2011. The ACC amended its original decision that approved the
2011 Plan as follows: the ACC (a) reversed its approval of  a
feed-in tariff program; (b) restricted APS’s ownership of facilities to only economically
challenged, rural schools and only after a school has received a bid from a third-party solar
installer; (c) approved the Rapid Reservation program; and (d) maintained the original approved
budget with some timing modifications.

Demand-Side Management Adjustor Charge (“DSMAC”).

The 2009 retail rate case settlement
agreement requires APS to submit an annual Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan for review by and
approval of the ACC. On July 15, 2009, APS filed its initial Energy Efficiency Implementation
Plan, requesting approval by the ACC of programs and program elements for which APS had estimated a
budget in the amount of $50 million for 2010. APS received ACC approval of all of its proposed
programs and implemented the new DSMAC on March 1, 2010. A surcharge was added to customer bills
in order to recover these estimated amounts for use on certain demand-side management programs.
The surcharge allows for the recovery of energy efficiency expenses and any earned incentives.

The ACC approved recovery of all 2009 program costs plus incentives. The change from program
cost recovery on a historical basis to recovery on a concurrent basis, as authorized in the
settlement agreement, resulted in this one-time need to address two years (2009 and 2010) of cost
recovery. As requested by APS, 2009 program cost recovery is to be spread over a three-year
period.

On June 1, 2010, APS filed its 2011 Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan. In order to meet
the energy efficiency goal for 2011 established by the settlement agreement of annual energy
savings of 1.25%, expressed as a percent of total energy resources to meet retail load, APS
proposed a total budget for 2011 of $79 million. On February 17, 2011, a total budget for 2011 of
$80 million was approved and when added to the amortization of 2009 costs discussed above less
the $10 million already being recovered in general rates, the DSMAC would recover approximately
$75 million over a twelve month period beginning March 1, 2011. These amounts do not
include approximately $1 million for an electric vehicle charging station program submitted to the
ACC for approval on September 30, 2010.

PSA Mechanism and Balance.

The PSA, which the ACC initially approved in 2005 as a part
of APS’s 2003 rate case, and which was modified by the ACC in 2007, provides for the adjustment of
retail rates to reflect variations in retail fuel and purchased power costs. The PSA is subject to
specified parameters and procedures, including the following:

•

APS records deferrals for recovery or refund to the extent actual retail fuel and
purchased power costs vary from the Base Fuel Rate;

•

under a 90/10 sharing arrangement, APS defers 90% of the difference between retail
fuel and purchased power costs (excluding certain costs, such as renewable energy
resources and the capacity components of long-term purchased power agreements acquired
through competitive procurement) and the Base Fuel Rate; APS absorbs 10% of the retail
fuel and purchased power costs above the Base Fuel Rate and retains 10% of the benefit
from the retail fuel and purchased power costs that are below the Base Fuel Rate;



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

•

an adjustment to the PSA rate is made annually each February 1

st

(unless
otherwise approved by the ACC) and goes into effect automatically unless suspended by
the ACC;

•

the PSA uses a forward-looking estimate of fuel and purchased power costs to set the
annual PSA rate, which is reconciled to actual costs experienced for each PSA Year
(February 1 through January 31) (see the following bullet point);

•

the PSA rate includes (a) a “Forward Component,” under which APS recovers or refunds
differences between expected fuel and purchased power costs for the upcoming calendar
year and those embedded in the Base Fuel Rate; (b) a “Historical Component,” under
which differences between actual fuel and purchased power costs and those recovered
through the combination of the Base Fuel Rate and the Forward Component are recovered
during the next PSA Year; and (c) a “Transition Component,” under which APS may seek
mid-year PSA changes due to large variances between actual fuel and purchased power
costs and the combination of the Base Fuel Rate and the Forward Component; and

•

the PSA rate may not be increased or decreased more than $0.004 per kWh in a year
without permission of the ACC.

The following table shows the changes in the deferred fuel and purchased power regulatory
asset (liability) for 2010 and 2009 (dollars in millions):

The PSA rate for the PSA year beginning February 1, 2011 is ($0.0057) per kWh as compared to
($0.0045) per kWh for the prior year. The regulatory liability at December 31, 2010 reflects lower
average prices, primarily for natural gas and gas-based generation. Any uncollected
(overcollected) deferrals during the 2011 PSA year will be included in the historical component of
the PSA rate for the PSA year beginning February 1, 2012.

Transmission Rates and Transmission Cost Adjustor

.

In July 2008, the FERC approved an Open
Access Transmission Tariff for APS to move from fixed rates to a formula rate-setting methodology
in order to more accurately reflect and recover the costs that APS incurs in providing transmission
services. A large portion of the rate represents charges for transmission services to serve APS’s
retail customers (“Retail Transmission Charges”). In order to recover the Retail Transmission
Charges, APS must file an application with, and obtain approval from, the ACC to reflect changes in
Retail Transmission Charges through the TCA.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The formula rate is updated each year effective June 1 on the basis of APS’s actual cost of
service, as disclosed in APS’s FERC Form 1 report for the previous fiscal year. Items to be
updated include actual capital expenditures made as compared with previous projections,
transmission revenue credits and other items. The resolution of proposed adjustments can result in
significant volatility in the revenues to be collected. APS reviews the proposed formula rate
filing amounts with the ACC staff. Any items or adjustments which are not agreed to by APS and the
ACC staff can remain in dispute until settled or litigated at FERC. Settlement or litigated
resolution of disputed issues could require an extended period of time and have a significant
effect on the Retail Transmission Charge because any adjustment, though applied prospectively, may
be calculated to account for previously over-collected amounts.

Effective June 1, 2010, APS’s annual wholesale transmission rates for all users of its
transmission system were reduced by approximately $12 million in accordance with the FERC-approved
formula as a result of lower costs reflected in the formula. Approximately $10 million of this
revenue reduction relates to transmission services used for APS’s retail customers. On May 20,
2010, APS filed with the ACC an application for the related reduction of its TCA rate. The ACC
approved the TCA reduction on July 27, 2010.

4. Income Taxes

Certain assets and liabilities are reported differently for income tax purposes than they are
for financial statements purposes. The tax effect of these differences is recorded as deferred
taxes. We calculate deferred taxes using the current income tax rates.

APS has recorded regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities related to income taxes on its
Balance Sheets in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated operations. The regulatory
assets are for certain temporary differences, primarily the allowance for equity funds used during
construction and pension and other postretirement benefits. The regulatory liabilities relate to
deferred taxes resulting primarily from investment tax credits. APS amortizes these amounts as the
differences reverse.

Pinnacle West expects to recognize approximately $132 million of cash tax benefits related to
SunCor’s strategic asset sales (see Note 23), a majority of which have been realized as of December
31, 2010. Approximately $7 million of these benefits were recorded in 2010 as reductions to income
tax expense related to the current impairment charges. The additional $125 million of tax benefits
were recorded as reductions to income tax expense related to SunCor impairment charges recorded on
or before December 31, 2009.

The $68 million income tax receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represent the
anticipated refunds related to an APS tax accounting method change approved by the IRS in the third
quarter of 2009 and the current year tax benefits related to the SunCor strategic asset sales that
closed in 2010. A majority of this amount is classified as long-term, as cash refunds are not
expected to be received in the next twelve months.

During the first quarter of 2010, the Company reached a settlement with the IRS with regard to
the examination of tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2005 through 2007. As a result of
this settlement, net uncertain tax positions decreased $62 million, including approximately $3
million which decreased our effective tax rate. Additionally, the settlement resulted in the
recognition of net interest benefits of approximately $4 million through the effective tax rate.

Included in the balances of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
approximately $7 million, $16 million and $16 million, respectively, of tax positions that, if
recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate.

As of the balance sheet date, the tax year ended December 31, 2008 and all subsequent tax
years remain subject to examination by the IRS. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to
state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 1999. We do not anticipate that
there will be any significant increases or decreases in our unrecognized tax benefits within the
next twelve months.

We reflect interest and penalties, if any, on unrecognized tax benefits in the Consolidated
Statements of Income as income tax expense. The amount of interest recognized in the Consolidated
Statement of Income related to unrecognized tax benefits was a pre-tax benefit of $2 million for
2010, a pre-tax expense of $2 million for 2009 and a pre-tax benefit of $51 million for 2008.

The total amount of accrued liabilities for interest recognized in the consolidated Balance
Sheets related to unrecognized tax benefits was $6 million as of December 31, 2010, $8 million as
of December 31, 2009 and $6 million as of December 31, 2008. To the extent that matters are
settled favorably, this amount could reverse and decrease our effective tax rate. Additionally, as
of December 31, 2010, we have recognized $5 million of interest income to be received on the
overpayment of income taxes for certain adjustments that we have filed, or will file, with the IRS.

5. Lines of Credit and Short-Term Borrowings

Pinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities in order to enhance
liquidity and provide credit support for the commercial paper programs. During the first quarter of
2010, Pinnacle West and APS refinanced revolving credit facilities existing at the time that would
have otherwise matured in December 2010. Since March 2010, Pinnacle West and APS have accessed the
commercial paper markets, which neither company had utilized since the third quarter of 2008 due to
negative market conditions.

letters of credit, up to $583 million. At December 31, 2009, APS had no borrowings or letters of
credit under its revolving credit facilities or other short-term borrowings.

Debt Provisions

Although provisions in APS’s articles of incorporation and ACC financing orders establish
maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that APS may issue, APS does not expect any of these
provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements. On October 30, 2007, the ACC
issued a financing order in which it approved APS’s request, subject to specified parameters and
procedures, to increase (a) APS’s short-term debt authorization from 7% of APS’s capitalization to
(i) 7% of APS’s capitalization plus (ii) $500 million (which is required to be used for purchases
of natural gas and power) and (b) APS’s long-term debt authorization from approximately $3.2
billion to $4.2 billion in light of the projected growth of APS and its customer base and the
resulting projected financing needs. This financing order expires December 31, 2012; however, all
debt previously authorized and outstanding on December 31, 2012 will remain authorized and valid
obligations of APS.

Credit Facilities and Debt Issuances

Pinnacle West

In June 2010, Pinnacle West received approximately $100 million related to the sale of APSES’
district cooling business. The net proceeds were used to repay short-term indebtedness.

APS

On July 13, 2010, APS changed the interest rate mode for the approximately $33 million of
Coconino County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Arizona
Public Service Company Navajo Project) 1994 Series A, due 2029. The rate period for the bonds
changed from a daily rate mode, supported by a letter of credit, to a three-year term rate mode
that will bear interest at a rate of 3.625% per annum for three years. The letter of credit was
terminated in connection with this change, and there is no bank or other third-party credit support
for the bonds in the term rate mode.

On August 10, 2010, APS changed the letter of credit supporting the approximately $17 million
of Coconino County, Arizona Pollution Control Corporation Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Arizona
Public Service Company Project) Series 1998, due 2033. The bonds were in a daily rate mode
supported by a prior letter of credit and remain in a daily rate mode, supported by a new
three-year letter of credit expiring in August 2013.

On October 12, 2010, APS changed the interest rate mode for the approximately $147 million of
City of Farmington, New Mexico Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds (Arizona Public Service
Company Four Corners Project) 1994 Series A and 1994 Series B, due 2024 and City of Farmington, New
Mexico Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Arizona Public Service Company Four Corners Project) 1994
Series C, due 2024. The rate period for the 1994 Series A bonds and the 1994 Series B bonds changed
from a daily rate mode, supported by letters of credit, to a term rate mode to maturity, subject to
optional redemption after year ten, that will bear interest at a rate of 4.70% per annum until
maturity in 2024 unless the optional redemption is exercised by APS. The rate period for the 1994
Series C bonds changed from a daily rate mode, supported by a letter of credit, to a three-year
term rate mode that will bear interest at a rate of 2.875% per annum until October 2013. The
letters of credit supporting each of these three series of bonds were terminated in connection with
these changes, and there is no bank or other third-party credit support for any of these bonds.

On January 1, 2010, due to the adoption of amended accounting guidance relating to VIEs, APS
began consolidating the Palo Verde Sale Leaseback Trusts. As a result of consolidation of these
VIEs, APS has reported the Lessor Trusts’ long-term debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Interest rates on these debt instruments are 8% and are fixed for the remaining life of the debt.
As of December 31, 2010, approximately $29 million was classified as current maturities of long-term debt and
approximately $97 million was classified as long-term debt relating to these VIEs. These debt
instruments mature on December 30, 2015 and have sinking fund features that are serviced by the
lease payments. See Note 20 for additional discussion of the VIEs.

SunCor

In 2010, SunCor sold land parcels, commercial assets and master planned home-building
communities for approximately $72 million, which approximated the carrying value of these assets,
resulting in a net gain of zero. In connection with these sales, SunCor negotiated a restructuring
of certain of its credit facilities. The debt restructuring resulted in an after-tax gain of
approximately $10 million. At December 31, 2010, SunCor had no debt outstanding.

Debt Provisions

Pinnacle West’s and APS’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing
arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios. Pinnacle West and APS comply with this
covenant and each anticipates it will continue to meet this and other significant covenant
requirements. For both Pinnacle West and APS, this covenant requires that the ratio of
consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65%. At December 31, 2010, the
ratio was approximately 49% for Pinnacle West and 46% for APS. Failure to comply with such covenant
levels would result in an event of default which, generally speaking, would require the immediate
repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross-default other debt. See further
discussion of “cross-default” provisions below.

Neither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would
result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating
downgrade. However, our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates
we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings.

All of Pinnacle West’s loan agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in
defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or
APS were to default under certain other material agreements. All of APS’s bank agreements contain
cross-default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment
under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.
Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility
borrowings.

An existing ACC order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40%. As
defined in the ACC order, the common equity ratio is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of
total shareholder equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt. At
December 31, 2010, APS’s common equity ratio, as defined, was 53%. Its total shareholder equity was
approximately $3.8 billion, and total capitalization was approximately $7.2 billion. APS would be
prohibited from paying dividends if the payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below
approximately $2.9 billion, assuming APS’s total capitalization remains the same. This restriction
does not materially affect Pinnacle West’s ability to meet its ongoing capital requirements.

In April 2010, Pinnacle West issued 6,900,000 shares of common stock at an
offering price of $38.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $253
million. Pinnacle West contributed all of the net proceeds from this offering into APS
in the
form of equity infusions. APS has used these contributions to repay short-term
indebtedness, to finance capital expenditures and for other general corporate
purposes.

8. Retirement Plans and Other Benefits

Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a
non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and
its subsidiaries. All new employees participate in the account balance plan. Defined benefit
plans specify the amount of benefits a plan participant is to receive using information about the
participant. The pension plan covers nearly all employees. The supplemental excess benefit
retirement plan covers officers of the Company and highly compensated employees designated for
participation by the Board of Directors. Our employees do not contribute to the plans. Generally,
we calculate the benefits based on age, years of service and pay.

We also sponsor other postretirement benefits for the employees of Pinnacle West and our
subsidiaries. We provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees. Employees must
retire to become eligible for these retirement benefits, which are based on years of service and
age. For the medical insurance plans, retirees make contributions to cover a portion of the plan
costs. For the life insurance plan, retirees do not make contributions. We retain the right to
change or eliminate these benefits.

Pinnacle West uses a December 31  measurement date each year for its pension and other
postretirement benefit plans. The market-related value of our plan assets is their fair value at
the measurement date. See Note 14 for discussion of how fair values are determined. Due to
subjective and complex judgments, which may be required in determining fair values, actual results
could differ from the results estimated through the application of these methods.

A significant portion of the changes in the actuarial gains and losses of our pension and
postretirement plans is attributable to APS and therefore is recoverable in rates. Accordingly,
these changes are recorded as a regulatory asset. In its 2009 retail rate case settlement, APS
received approval to defer a portion of pension and other postretirement benefit cost increases
incurred in 2011 and 2012.

On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law comprehensive health care reform legislation
under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Act”). One feature of the Act is the
elimination of the tax deduction for prescription drug costs that are reimbursed as part of the
Medicare Part D subsidy. Although this tax increase does not take effect until 2013, we are
required to recognize the full accounting impact in our financial statements in the period in which
the Act is signed. In accordance with accounting for regulated companies, the loss of this
deduction is substantially offset by a regulatory asset that will be recovered through future
electric revenues. In the first quarter of 2010, Pinnacle West charged regulatory assets and
liabilities for a total of $42 million, with a corresponding increase in accumulated deferred
income tax liabilities, to reflect the impact of this change in tax law.

In selecting the pretax expected long-term rate of return on plan assets we consider past

reasonable given our asset allocation in relation to historical and expected performance.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Plan Assets

The Board of Directors has delegated oversight of the plans’ assets to an Investment
Management Committee, which has adopted an investment policy. The investment policy’s overall
strategy is to achieve an adequate level of trust assets relative to the benefit obligation. To
achieve this objective, the plans’ investment policies provide for a mix of investments in
long-term fixed income assets and return-generating assets. Long-term fixed income assets are
designed to offset changes in benefit obligations due to changes in discount rates and inflation.
Return-generating assets are intended to provide a reasonable long-term rate of investment return
with a prudent level of volatility. The determination of total allocation between
return-generating and long-term fixed income assets is
reviewed on at least an annual basis. Other investment strategies include the prohibition of
investments in Pinnacle West securities and the external management of the plans’ assets.

Long-term fixed income assets consist primarily of fixed income debt securities issued by the
U.S. Treasury, other government agencies, and corporations. Long-term fixed income assets may also
include interest rate swaps, U.S. Treasury futures and other instruments. The investment policy
does not provide for a specific mix of long-term fixed income assets, but does require the average
credit rating of such assets to be considered upper medium grade or above. The 2010 year-end
long-term fixed income asset strategy focused on investments in corporate bonds of primarily
investment-grade U.S. issuers and long-term treasuries, with total long-term fixed income assets
representing 41% of total pension plan assets and 39% of other benefit plans assets.

Return-generating assets in the pension plan and other benefit plans target a mix of
approximately 64% U.S. equities, 27% international equities, and 9% alternative investments. The
2010 year-end U.S. equity holdings were invested primarily in large-cap companies in diverse
industries. International equities include investments in emerging and developing markets.
Return-generating assets also include investments in securities through commingled funds in common
and collective trusts. Alternative investments primarily include investments in real estate. The
2010 year-end return-generating assets represented 59% of total pension plan assets and 61% of
other benefit plans assets.

The return for December 31, 2010 represents the return on assets held as of March
31, 2010, the beginning of the period in which all the assets were transferred out of Level 3.
The return for December 31, 2009 represents the return on assets held as of December
31, 2009, as no transfers occurred into or out of Level 3 during the year.

(b)

Transfers into and out of Level 3 are measured at the beginning of the period in which
the transfer occurs. Transfers out of Level 3 during 2010 relate to our Real Estate
Common and Collective Trust being transferred to a Level 2 investment. During 2009 the
Real Estate Common and Collective Trust had special redemption restrictions in place,
which limited our ability to transact at the fund’s net asset value. During 2010 these
special redemption restrictions were lifted, and we were able to transact in the fund at the
net asset value according to the fund’s normal redemption policy.

Contributions

The required minimum contribution to our pension plan is zero in 2011 and approximately $85
million in 2012. In 2010, we made voluntary contributions of $200 million to our pension plan.
The contribution to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2010 was approximately $17 million.
The contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans for 2011 and 2012 are expected to be
approximately $20 million each year. APS and other subsidiaries fund their share of the
contributions. APS’s share is approximately 98% of both plans.

Employee Savings Plan Benefits

Pinnacle West sponsors a defined contribution savings plan for eligible employees of Pinnacle
West and its subsidiaries. In 2010, costs related to APS’s employees represented 98% of the total
cost of this plan. In a defined contribution savings plan, the benefits a participant receives
result from regular contributions participants make to their own individual account, the Company’s
matching contributions and earnings or losses on their investments. Under this plan, the Company
matches a percentage of the participants’ contributions in cash which is then invested in the same
investment mix as participants elect to invest their own future contributions. Pinnacle West
recorded expenses for this plan of approximately $9 million for 2010, $9 million for 2009 and $8
million for 2008.

9. Leases

We lease certain vehicles, land, buildings, equipment and miscellaneous other items through
operating rental agreements with varying terms, provisions and expiration dates.

Total lease expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $23 million in
2010, $28 million in 2009 and $28 million in 2008. APS’s lease expense was $19 million in 2010,
$19 million in 2009 and $21 million in 2008.

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust entities in order to
sell and lease back interests in Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (“Palo Verde”) Unit 2 and
related common facilities. Prior to January 1, 2010 the arrangements were accounted for as
operating leases.
On January 1, 2010, due to the adoption of amended accounting guidance related to VIE’s these
agreements were deemed variable interests and consolidated. We adopted this accounting change
using retrospective application and have adjusted prior periods presented. Consolidation of the
lessor trust entities eliminates the lease accounting we previously reported and results in changes
in our consolidated assets, debt, equity, and net income. The above disclosures exclude the
impacts of these transactions, as lease accounting for these agreements is eliminated upon
consolidation. See Note 20 for a discussion of VIEs.

10. Jointly-Owned Facilities

APS shares ownership of some of its generating and transmission facilities with other
companies. Our share of operations and maintenance expense and utility plant costs related to
these facilities is accounted for using proportional consolidation. The following table shows

11. Commitments and Contingencies

Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station

Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal

APS currently estimates it will incur $132 million (in 2010 dollars) over the
current life of Palo Verde for its share of the costs related to the on-site interim storage of
spent nuclear fuel. At December 31, 2010, APS had a regulatory liability of $45 million that
represents amounts recovered in retail rates in excess of amounts spent for on-site interim spent
fuel storage.

Nuclear Insurance

The Palo Verde participants are insured against public liability for a nuclear incident up to
$12.6 billion per occurrence. As required by the Price Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act,
Palo Verde maintains the maximum available nuclear liability insurance in the amount of $375
million, which is provided by commercial insurance carriers. The remaining balance of $12.2
billion is provided through a mandatory industry wide retrospective assessment program. If losses
at any nuclear power plant covered by the program exceed the accumulated funds, APS could be
assessed retrospective premium adjustments. The maximum assessment per reactor under the program
for each nuclear incident is approximately $118 million, subject to an annual limit of $18 million
per incident, to be periodically adjusted for inflation. Based on APS’s interest in the three Palo
Verde units, APS’s maximum potential assessment per incident for all three units is approximately
$103 million, with an annual payment limitation of approximately $15 million.

The Palo Verde participants maintain “all risk” (including nuclear hazards) insurance for
property damage to, and decontamination of, property at Palo Verde in the aggregate amount of $2.75
billion, a substantial portion of which must first be applied to stabilization and decontamination.
APS has also secured insurance against portions of any increased cost of generation or purchased
power and business interruption resulting from a sudden and unforeseen accidental outage of any of
the three units. The property damage, decontamination, and replacement power coverages are
provided by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (“NEIL”). APS is subject to retrospective
assessments under all NEIL policies if NEIL’s losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds.
The maximum amount APS could incur under the current NEIL policies totals approximately $16 million
for each retrospective assessment declared by NEIL’s Board of Directors due to losses. In
addition, NEIL policies contain rating triggers that would result in APS providing approximately
$44 million of collateral assurance within 20 business days of a rating downgrade to non-investment
grade. The insurance coverage discussed in this and the previous paragraph is subject to certain
policy conditions and exclusions.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments and Purchase Obligations

APS is party to purchase obligations and various fuel and purchased power contracts with terms
expiring between 2011 and 2042 that include required purchase provisions. APS estimates the
contract requirements to be approximately $594 million in 2011; $529 million in 2012; $419 million
in 2013; $544 million in 2014; $526 million in 2015; and $7.2 billion thereafter. However, these
amounts may vary significantly pursuant to certain provisions in such contracts that permit us to
decrease required purchases under certain circumstances.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Of the various fuel and purchased power contracts mentioned above, some of those contracts
have take-or-pay provisions. The contracts APS has for its coal supply include take-or-pay
provisions. The current take-or-pay coal contracts have terms that expire in 2024.

The following table summarizes our actual and estimated take-or-pay commitments (dollars in

(a)

Total take-or-pay commitments are approximately $605 million. The total net
present value of these commitments is approximately $435 million.

Renewable Energy Credits

APS has entered into contracts to purchase renewable energy credits to comply with
the Renewable Energy Standard. APS estimates the contract requirements to be approximately $57
million in 2011; $20 million in 2012; $20 million in 2013; $20 million in 2014; $20 million in
2015; and $196 million thereafter.

Coal Mine Reclamation Obligations

APS must reimburse certain coal providers for amounts incurred for coal mine reclamation.
APS’s coal mine reclamation obligation was approximately $117 million at December 31, 2010 and $92
million at December 31, 2009.

FERC Market Issues

On July 25, 2001, the FERC ordered an evidentiary proceeding to discuss and evaluate possible
refunds for wholesale sales in the Pacific Northwest. The FERC affirmed the administrative law
judge’s conclusion that the prices in the Pacific Northwest were not unreasonable or unjust and
refunds should not be ordered in this proceeding. This decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On August 24, 2007, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion that
remanded the proceeding to the FERC for further consideration. Although the FERC has not yet
determined whether any refunds will ultimately be required, we do not expect that the resolution of
these issues will have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Superfund

Superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating
the soil, water or air. Those who generated, transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a
contaminated site are among those who are PRPs. PRPs may be strictly, and often are jointly and
severally, liable for clean-up. On September 3, 2003, the EPA advised APS that the EPA considers
APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52

nd

Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 (OU3) in
Phoenix, Arizona. APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site. APS and Pinnacle West
have agreed with the EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS facilities within
OU3. In addition,
on September 23, 2009, APS agreed with the EPA and one other PRP to voluntarily assist with the
funding and management of the site-wide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study
work plan. We estimate that our costs related to this investigation and study will be
approximately $1 million, which is reserved as a liability on our financial statements. We
anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future, but because the overall investigation
is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized, at the present time we
cannot accurately estimate our total expenditures.

Landlord Bankruptcy

On April 16, 2009, the landlord for our corporate headquarters building announced that it is
seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. We currently have several
assets on our books related to our landlord, the most significant of which is an asset related to
levelized rent payments for the building of approximately $71 million. This amount will continue
to increase to approximately $93 million as a result of the lease terms until 2015, when this
amount will begin to decrease over the remaining life of the lease. In November 2010, our landlord
exited bankruptcy and our leases were assumed and reinstated. This matter is now closed.

12. Asset Retirement Obligations

APS has asset retirement obligations for its Palo Verde nuclear facilities and certain other
generation, transmission and distribution assets. The Palo Verde asset retirement obligation
primarily relates to final plant decommissioning. This obligation is based on the NRC’s
requirements for disposal of radiated property or plant and agreements APS reached with the ACC for
final decommissioning of the plant. The non-nuclear generation asset retirement obligations
primarily relate to requirements for removing portions of those plants at the end of the plant life
or lease term.

Some of APS’s transmission and distribution assets have asset retirement obligations because
they are subject to right of way and easement agreements that require final removal. These
agreements have a history of uninterrupted renewal that APS expects to continue. As a result, APS
cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the asset retirement obligation related to such
distribution and transmission assets.

Additionally, APS has aquifer protection permits for some of its generation sites that require
the closure of certain facilities at those sites. The asset retirement obligations associated with
our non-regulated assets are immaterial.

14. Fair Value Measurements

We disclose the fair value of certain assets and liabilities according to a fair value
hierarchy. This hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the inputs used to determine fair
values, which are then classified and disclosed in one of three categories. The three levels of
the fair value hierarchy are:

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Active
markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient
frequency and volume to provide information on an ongoing basis. This category includes
derivative instruments that are exchange-traded such as futures, cash equivalents invested
in exchange-traded money market funds, exchange-traded equities, and nuclear decommissioning
trust investments in Treasury securities.

Level 2 — Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable.
This category includes nonexchange-traded contracts such as forwards, options, and swaps.
This category also includes investments, in common and commingled funds that are redeemable
and valued based on the funds’ net asset values.

Level 3 — Model-derived valuations with significant unobservable inputs that are supported
by little or no market activity. Instruments in this category include long-dated derivative
transactions where models are required due to the length of the transaction, options,
transactions in locations where observable market data does not exist, and common and
collective trusts with significant restrictions on our ability to transact in the fund. The
valuation models we employ utilize spot prices, forward prices, historical market data and
other factors to forecast future prices. The primary valuation technique we use to
calculate the fair value of contracts where price quotes are not available is based on the
extrapolation of forward pricing curves using observable market data for more liquid
delivery points in the same region and actual transactions at the more illiquid delivery
points.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input
that is significant to the fair value measurement. We maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If market data is not readily available, inputs may
reflect our own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use. Our assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect
the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value
hierarchy levels. Thus, a valuation may be classified in Level 3 even though the valuation may
include significant inputs that are readily observable. We assess whether a market is active by
obtaining observable broker quotes, reviewing actual market transactions, and assessing the volume
of transactions. We consider broker quotes observable inputs when the quote is binding on the
broker, we can validate the quote with market transactions, or we can determine that the inputs the
broker used to arrive at the quoted price are observable.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements

We apply recurring fair value measurements to derivative instruments, nuclear decommissioning
trusts, certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans
(see Note 8).

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents represent short-term investments in exchange-traded money market funds that
are valued using quoted prices in active markets.

Risk Management Activities

Exchange-traded contracts are valued using quoted prices in active markets. For non-exchange
traded contracts, we calculate fair market value based on the average of the bid and offer price,
discounted to reflect net present value. We maintain certain valuation adjustments for a number of
risks associated with the valuation of future commitments. These include valuation adjustments for
liquidity and credit risks based on the financial condition of counterparties. The liquidity
valuation adjustment represents the cost that would be incurred if all unmatched positions were
closed-out or hedged.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The credit valuation adjustment represents estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to
counterparties, taking into account netting arrangements, expected default experience for the
credit rating of the counterparties and the overall diversification of the portfolio.
Counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of major energy companies, municipalities,
local distribution companies and financial institutions. We maintain credit policies that
management believes minimize overall credit risk. Determination of the credit quality of
counterparties is based upon a number of factors,
including credit ratings, financial condition, project economics and collateral requirements.
When applicable, we employ standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and
negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.

Some of our derivative instrument transactions are valued based on unobservable inputs due to
the long-term nature of contracts or the unique location of the transactions. Our long-dated
energy transactions consist of observable valuations for the near term portion and unobservable
valuations for the long-term portions of the transaction. When the unobservable portion is
significant to the overall valuation of the transaction, the entire transaction is classified as
Level 3. Our classification of instruments as Level 3 is primarily reflective of the long-term
nature of our energy transactions, and is not reflective of material inactive markets.

Nuclear Decommissioning Trust

The nuclear decommissioning trust invests in fixed income securities directly and equity
securities indirectly through commingled funds. The commingled equity funds are valued based on
the fund’s net asset value (“NAV”) and are classified within Level 2. We may transact in the fund
on a semi-monthly basis. Our trustee provides valuation of our nuclear decommissioning trust
assets by using pricing services to determine fair market value. We assess these valuations and
verify that pricing can be supported by actual recent market transactions. The trust fund
investments have been established to satisfy APS’s nuclear decommissioning obligations.

contract.

Transfers reflect the fair market value at the beginning of the period and are triggered by a
change in the lowest significant input as of the end of the period. We had no significant Level 1
transfers to or from any other hierarchy level. Transfers in or out of Level 3 are typically
related to our long-dated energy transactions that extend beyond available quoted periods.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

We may be required to record other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
These nonrecurring fair value measurements typically involve write-downs of individual assets due
to impairment.

Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

The carrying value of our net accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings
approximate fair value. Our long-term debt fair value estimates are based on quoted market prices
of the same or similar issues. Certain of our debt instruments contain third-party credit
enhancements and, in accordance with GAAP, we do not consider the effect of these credit
enhancements when determining fair value.

Nuclear Decommissioning Trust

To fund the costs APS expects to incur to decommission Palo Verde, APS established external
decommissioning trusts in accordance with NRC regulations. Third-party investment managers are
authorized to buy and sell securities per their stated investment guidelines. The trust funds are
invested in fixed income securities and domestic equity securities. APS classifies investments in
decommissioning trust funds as available for sale. As a result, we record the decommissioning
trust funds at their fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Because of the ability of APS
to recover decommissioning costs in rates and in accordance with the regulatory treatment for
decommissioning trust funds, we have recorded the offsetting amount of gains or losses on
investment securities in other regulatory liabilities or assets

calculating diluted earnings per share were 107,137,785 shares in 2010, 101,263,795 shares in
2009 and 100,964,920 shares in 2008.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Options to purchase 192,542 shares of common stock during 2010 were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise prices were greater than
the average market price of the common shares. Options to purchase shares of common stock that
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share were 572,301 during 2009 and
687,375 during 2008.

16. Stock-Based Compensation

We have a 2007 long-term incentive plan (“2007 Plan”) that allows the Company to grant
restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, stock grants, incentive and stock
options, stock appreciation rights, performance share units, performance cash awards, dividend
equivalents and stock to eligible individuals.

Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Stock Grants

Stock grants were issued to non-officer members of the Board of Directors in 2009 and 2008
under the 2007 Plan and were paid in fully transferable shares of stock. In 2010, non-officer
members of the Board of Directors were given the option to elect to receive a stock grant, or to
defer receipt and receive restricted stock units in lieu of the stock grant. The 2010 stock grants
and deferred restricted stock units were issued under the 2007 Plan. The election to receive a
stock grant or to defer, and the related elections were made on or before December 31, 2009.
Participants had to elect to receive their deferred grant as of the last business day of the month
following the month in which they separate service from the Board of Directors, or as of a date
specified by them in 2011 or later. The deferral has the election to receive payment in either 50%
cash and 50% fully transferable shares of stock, or 100% in fully transferable shares of stock, in
exchange for each restricted stock unit. Each restricted stock unit payable in cash represents the
right to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of one share of Pinnacle West’s
common stock. The deferral will also include dividend equivalent payments in either 50% cash and
50% fully-transferable shares of stock or in 100% fully-transferable shares of stock per the
participant’s election equal to the amount of dividends that they would have received if the
participant had owned the stock to which the restricted stock units relate from the date of grant
to the date of payment plus interest.

Restricted stock unit awards were granted to officers and key employees in 2010, 2009 and 2008
under the 2007 Plan. For 2009 and 2008 officers and key employees elected to receive payment in
either cash or in fully transferable shares of stock, in exchange for each restricted stock unit on
pre-established valuation dates. For the 2010 award the election for the awards is either 50% cash
and 50% fully transferable shares of stock, or 100% in fully transferable shares of stock, in
exchange for each restricted stock unit. Each restricted stock unit payable in cash represents the
right to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of one share of Pinnacle West’s
common stock.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Restricted stock unit awards vest and settle in annual installments over a four-year period.
In addition, officers and key employees will receive a cash payment equal to the amount of
dividends that they would have received if they had owned the stock to which the restricted stock
units relate from the date of grant to the date of payment plus interest. For the 2010 award the
officers and key employees will receive either a 50% cash payment and 50% fully transferrable
shares of stock, or 100% in fully transferable shares of stock equal to the amount of dividends that they would
have received if they had owned the stock to which the restricted stock units relate from the date
of grant to the date of payment plus interest. The dividend equivalents payout election has to be
the same as the election for the payout of restricted stock units. For any employee that was
eligible to retire before the settlement date, the employee’s restricted stock unit awards vest by
retirement date and the compensation expense is recognized by retirement eligibility. As the
restricted stock unit award is accounted for as a liability award, compensation costs, initially
measured based on the Company’s stock price on the grant date, are remeasured at each balance sheet
date, using Pinnacle West’s closing stock price.

Restricted stock unit awards were granted to a selected set of key employees of Pinnacle West
on October 21, 2008, February 18, 2009, March 18, 2009, April 13, 2009, July 29, 2009, January 19,
2010, February 22, 2010, April 1, 2010 and November 2, 2010 under the 2007 Plan. The award of the
restricted stock units follows the same vesting schedule as the 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010
restricted stock unit awards.

Performance Share Awards

Performance share awards were granted to officers and key employees in 2010, 2009 and 2008
under the 2007 Plan. Performance share awards for 2008 contain performance criteria that affect
the number of shares ultimately received. Generally, each recipient of performance shares is
entitled to receive shares of common stock after the end of a three-year performance period. The
number of shares each recipient ultimately receives, if any, is based upon the percentile ranking
of Pinnacle West’s earnings per share growth rate at the end of the three-year period as compared
with the earnings per share growth rate of all relevant companies in a specified utilities index.

Performance share awards for 2009 also contain performance criteria that affect the number of
shares that ultimately vest; 50% of the award is based on the same percentile ranking as the 2008
award and the other 50% of the award is based on six non-financial separate performance metrics.

Performance share awards for 2010 also contain performance criteria that affects the number of
shares that ultimately vest; 50% of the award is based upon the percentile ranking of Pinnacle
West’s total shareholder return at the end of the three-year performance period as compared with
the total shareholder return of all relevant companies in a specified utilities index and the other
50% of the award is based on six non-financial separate performance metrics.

For any employee that was eligible to retire before the settlement date, the employee’s
performance share awards vest by retirement date and the compensation expense is recognized by
retirement eligibility. Performance share awards are accounted for as liability awards, as
employees are not required to withhold at the minimum statutory required rate. Compensation costs,
initially measured based on the Company’s stock price on the grant date, are remeasured at each
balance sheet date, using Pinnacle West’s closing stock price. Management also evaluates the
probability of meeting the performance criteria at each balance sheet date. If the goals are not
achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is
reversed.

Performance shares were granted to officers and key employees of Pinnacle West on October 21,
2008, February 18, 2009, March 18, 2009, April 13, 2009, July 29, 2009, January 19, 2010, February

Retention Units

The retention unit awards have fully vested and settled on January 4, 2010; for any employee
that was eligible to retire before that date, the employee’s retention units vested by retirement
date and the compensation expense was recognized by retirement eligibility. Retention unit awards
were granted to key employees in 2006 and 2007. Each retention unit award represented the right to
receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of one share of Pinnacle West’s common stock,
determined on pre-established valuation dates. Each retention unit award vested and settled in
equal annual installments over a four-year period. In addition, the employee received a cash
payment equal to the amount of dividends that the employee would have received if the employee had
owned the stock from the date of grant to the date of payment plus interest. As this award was
accounted for as a liability award, compensation costs, initially measured based on the Company’s
stock price on the grant date, were remeasured at each balance sheet date, using Pinnacle West’s
closing stock price.

The amount of cash to settle the payment on the first business day of 2010 was $1.3 million,
2009 was $1.1 million, and 2008 was $1.3 million.

Incentive Shares

On January 21, 2009, the Human Resources Committee approved under the 2007 Plan payment of
2008 incentive awards to officers in the form of a Pinnacle West common stock grant. A total of
138,756 shares were issued for this stock grant with a grant date fair value of $32.58 per share.
The stock grant was included in stock compensation expense in 2008.

Stock Options

We have issued stock options in the past, but have not granted stock options since 2004. The
term of outstanding options cannot be longer than 10 years and options cannot be repriced during
their terms.

Cash received from options exercised under our share-based payment arrangements was $4.6
million for 2010, $3 million for 2009, and zero for 2008. The tax benefit realized for the tax
deductions from option exercises of the share-based payment arrangements were immaterial for 2010
and 2009, and zero for 2008.

The intrinsic value of options exercised was immaterial for 2010 and 2009, and zero for 2008.

As of December 31, 2010, there was $13.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans. That cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. The total fair value of
shares vested during 2010 was $11 million, 2009 was $10 million, and 2008 was $5 million.

We have reserved 8 million shares of common stock for issuance under the 2007 Plan. Under the
2007 Plan, any shares of stock that are potentially deliverable under the 2002 long term incentive
plan will be added to the number of shares available for grant under the 2007 Plan if the award is
cancelled, forfeited, or terminated such that those shares are returned to the Company.

The compensation cost that has been charged against Pinnacle West’s income for share-based
compensation plans was $15 million in 2010, $5 million in 2009, and $8 million in 2008. The
compensation cost that Pinnacle West has capitalized is immaterial for 2010, 2009 and 2008.
Pinnacle West’s total income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for
share-based compensation arrangements was $6 million in 2010, $2 million in 2009, and $3 million in
2008. APS’s share of compensation cost that has been charged against income was $15 million in
2010, $4 million in 2009, and $7 million in 2008.

Pinnacle West’s current policy is to issue new shares to satisfy share requirements for stock
compensation plans and it does not expect to repurchase any shares except to satisfy tax
withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock during 2011.

17. Business Segments

Pinnacle West’s reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which
consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily
electricity service to Native Load customers) and related activities and includes electricity
generation, transmission and distribution.

Our reportable business segments reflect a change from previously reported information. As of
December 31, 2010, our real estate activities are no longer considered a segment requiring separate
reporting or disclosure. In 2009 our real estate subsidiary, SunCor, began disposing of its
homebuilding operations, master-planned communities, land parcels, commercial assets and golf
courses in order to reduce its outstanding debt (see Note 23). The remaining assets held for sale
at December 31, 2010 were approximately $3 million. Additionally, all of SunCor’s operations are
reflected in discontinued operations.

Financial data for 2010, 2009 and 2008 is provided as follows (dollars in millions):

All other activities relate to SunCor, APSES and El Dorado. Income from
discontinued operations for 2010 is primarily related to the APSES sale of its district
cooling business. Loss from discontinued operations for 2009 and 2008 is primarily
related to real estate impairment charges at SunCor (see Note 23). In addition, income
from discontinued operations for 2008 includes the resolution of certain tax issues
associated with the sale of Silverhawk in 2005. None of these segments is a reportable
business segment.

18. Derivative Accounting

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity, natural gas, coal, emissions allowances and in interest rates. We manage
risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various derivative instruments,
including futures, forwards, options and swaps. As part of our overall risk management program, we
may use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity, fuels, and emissions
allowances and credits. Derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are used to
limit our exposure to cash flow variability on forecasted transactions. The changes in market
value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged transactions. We may
also invest in derivative instruments for trading purposes; however, for the year ended December
31, 2010, there was no material trading activity.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value; see Note 14 for a discussion of
fair value measurements. Derivative instruments for the physical delivery of purchase and sale
quantities transacted in the normal course of business qualify for the normal purchase and sales
scope exception and are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting. Due to the scope
exception, these derivative instruments are excluded from our derivative instrument discussion and
disclosures below.

We also enter into derivative instruments for economic hedging purposes. While we believe the
economic hedges mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, some of these instruments
may not meet the specific hedge accounting requirements and are not designated as accounting
hedges. Economic hedges not designated as accounting hedges are recorded at fair value on our
balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of income as incurred. These
instruments are included in the “non-designated hedges” discussion and disclosure below.

Hedge effectiveness is the degree to which the derivative instrument contract and the hedged
item are correlated and is measured based on the relative changes in fair value of the derivative
instrument contract and the hedged item over time. We assess hedge effectiveness both at inception
and on a continuing basis. These assessments exclude the time value of certain options. For
accounting hedges that are deemed an effective hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on
the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(“AOCI”) and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction
affects earnings. We recognize in current earnings, subject to the PSA, the gains and losses
representing hedge ineffectiveness, and the gains and losses on any hedge components which are
excluded from our effectiveness assessment. As of December 31, 2010, we hedged the majority of
certain exposures to the price variability of commodities for a maximum of 39 months.

In the electricity business, some contracts to purchase energy are netted against other
contracts to sell energy. This is called “book-out” and usually occurs in contracts that have the
same terms (quantities and delivery points) and for which power does not flow. We net these
book-outs, which reduces both revenues and fuel and purchased power costs in our Consolidated
Statements of Income, but this does not impact our financial condition, net income or cash flows.

For its regulated operations, APS defers for future rate treatment approximately 90% of
unrealized gains and losses on certain derivatives pursuant to the PSA mechanism that would
otherwise be recognized in income. Realized gains and losses on derivatives are deferred in
accordance with the PSA to the extent the amounts are above or below the Base Fuel Rate (see Note
3). Gains and losses from derivatives in the following tables represent the amounts reflected in
income before the effect of PSA deferrals.

As of December 31, 2010, we had the following outstanding gross notional amount of
derivatives, which represent both purchases and sales (does not reflect net position):

During the next twelve months, we estimate that a net loss of $106 million before income taxes
will be reclassified from AOCI as an offset to the effect of market price changes for the related
hedged transactions. In accordance with the PSA, certain of these amounts will be recorded as
either a regulatory asset or liability and have no effect on earnings.

Credit Risk and Credit Related Contingent Features

We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties. We
have risk management contracts with many counterparties, including two counterparties for which our
exposure represents approximately 44% of Pinnacle West’s $113 million of risk management assets as
of December 31, 2010. This exposure relates to long-term traditional wholesale contracts with
counterparties that have very high credit quality. Our risk management process assesses and
monitors the financial exposure of all counterparties. Despite the fact that the great majority of
trading counterparties’ debt is rated as investment grade by the credit rating agencies, there is
still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default, resulting in a material
impact on consolidated earnings for a given period. Counterparties in the portfolio consist
principally of financial institutions, major energy companies, municipalities and local
distribution companies. We maintain credit policies that we believe minimize overall credit risk
to within acceptable limits. Determination of the credit quality of our counterparties is based
upon a number of factors, including credit ratings and our evaluation of their financial condition.
To manage credit risk, we employ collateral requirements and standardized agreements that allow
for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.
Valuation adjustments are established representing our estimated credit losses on our overall
exposure to counterparties.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Certain of our derivative instrument contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features
including, among other things, investment grade credit rating provisions, credit-related cross
default provisions, and adequate assurance provisions. Adequate assurance provisions allow a
counterparty with reasonable grounds for uncertainty to demand additional collateral based on
subjective events and/or conditions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on December 31, 2010 was
$349 million, for which we had posted collateral of $192 million in the normal course of business.

For those derivative instruments in a net liability position, with investment grade credit
contingencies, the counterparties could demand additional collateral if our debt credit rating were
to fall below investment grade (below BBB- for Standard & Poor’s or Fitch or Baa3 for Moody’s),
which would be a violation of the credit rating provisions. If the investment grade contingent
features underlying these agreements had been triggered on December 31, 2010, after off-setting
asset positions under master netting arrangements we would have been required to post approximately
an additional $125 million of collateral to our counterparties; this amount includes those
contracts which qualify for scope exceptions, which are excluded from the derivative details in the
above footnote. We also have energy related non-derivative instrument contracts with investment
grade credit-related contingent features which could also require us to post additional collateral
of approximately $205 million if our debt credit ratings were to fall below investment grade.

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Palo Verde Sale Leaseback Trusts

In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate VIE lessor trusts in order to sell
and lease back interests in Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (“Palo Verde”) Unit 2 and related
common facilities. The VIE lessor trusts are single-asset leasing entities. APS will pay
approximately $49 million per year for the years 2010 to 2015 related to these leases. The leases
do not contain fixed price purchase options or residual value guarantees. However, the lease
agreements include fixed rate renewal periods which may have a significant impact on the VIEs’ economic
performance. We have concluded that these fixed rate renewal periods may give APS the ability to
utilize the asset for a significant portion of the asset’s economic life, and therefore provide APS
with the power to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic
performance. In addition to the fixed rate renewal periods, our primary beneficiary analysis also
considered that APS is the operating agent for Palo Verde, is obligated to decommission the leased
assets and has fair value purchase options.

Under the previous quantitative VIE consolidation model, APS was not considered the primary
beneficiary of the lessor trusts, as APS did not absorb the majority of the entities’ expected
losses or did not receive a majority of the residual returns. Prior to January 1, 2010 the
arrangements were accounted for as operating leases.

Consolidation of these VIEs eliminates the lease accounting we previously reported and results
in changes in our consolidated assets, debt, equity, and net income. Assets of the VIEs are
restricted and may only be used to settle the VIEs’ debt obligations and for payment to the
noncontrolling interest holders. Other than the VIEs’ assets now reported on our consolidated
financial statements, the creditors of the VIEs have no other recourse to the assets of APS or
Pinnacle West, except in certain circumstances such as a default by
APS under the lease. As a result of consolidation we have eliminated rent expense, and have recognized
depreciation and interest expense, resulting in an increase in net income for 2010 of $20 million
entirely attributable to the noncontrolling interests. Income attributable to Pinnacle West
shareholders remains the same. Consolidation of these VIEs also results in changes to our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, but does not impact net cash flows.

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 include the
following amounts relating to the VIEs (in millions):

December 31,

December 31,



Property plant and equipment, net of accumulated
depreciation

$


$


Long-term debt including current maturities



Equity- Noncontrolling interests



For regulatory ratemaking purposes the leases continue to be treated as operating leases and,
as a result, we have recorded a regulatory asset of $33 million as of December 31, 2010 and $31
million at December 31, 2009.

APS is exposed to losses relating to these lessor trust VIEs upon the occurrence of certain
events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur. Under certain circumstances
(for example, the NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde or the
occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to make specified payments to the
VIEs’ noncontrolling equity participants, assume the VIEs’ debt, and take title to the leased Unit
2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written down in value. If such an event
had occurred as of December 31, 2010, APS would have been required to pay the noncontrolling equity
participants approximately $146 million and assume $126 million of debt. Since APS now
consolidates the VIEs, the debt APS would be required to assume is already reflected in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We also have certain long-term purchased power agreements to purchase substantially all of an
entity’s output from a specified facility for a specified period. We have evaluated these
arrangements under the VIE accounting guidance and have determined that these agreements do not
represent variable interests. If these agreements had been deemed variable interests, we would not
be considered the primary beneficiary, as we do not have the power to direct the entities’
activities in a manner that would significantly impact their economic performance and, therefore,
would not consolidate the entities. The adoption of the amended VIE accounting guidance has not
changed how we account for these arrangements.

21. Guarantees and Surety Bonds

We have issued parental guarantees and obtained surety bonds on behalf of our subsidiaries,
including credit support instruments enabling APSES to offer energy-related products and surety
bonds at APS, principally related to self-insured workers’ compensation. Non-performance or
non-payment under the underlying contract by our subsidiaries would result in a payment liability
on our part under the guarantee or surety bond. No liability is currently recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets related to such instruments. At December 31, 2010, we had no
outstanding claims for payment under any of these instruments. Our guarantees and surety bonds
have no recourse or collateral provisions to allow us to recover amounts paid under these
instruments. The amounts and approximate terms of our guarantees and surety bonds for each
subsidiary at December 31, 2010 are as follows (dollars in millions):

Guarantees

APS has entered into various agreements that require letters of credit for financial assurance
purposes. At December 31, 2010, approximately $44 million of letters of credit were outstanding to
support existing pollution control bonds of similar amounts. The letters of credit are available
to fund the payment of principal and interest of such debt obligations. These letters of credit
expire in 2011 and 2013. APS has also entered into approximately $61 million of letters of credit
to support certain equity lessors in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions (see Note 7 for
further details on the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions). These letters of credit were
amended and extended in April 2010, and will expire in 2013.

We enter into agreements that include indemnification provisions relating to liabilities
arising from or related to certain of our agreements; most significantly, APS has agreed to
indemnify the equity participants and other parties in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions
with respect to certain tax matters. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in
the indemnification provisions and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under
such indemnification provisions cannot be reasonably estimated. Based on historical experience and
evaluation of the specific indemnities, we do not believe that any material loss related to such
indemnification provisions is likely.

22. Discontinued Operations

SunCor

(real estate segment)

—

In 2009, our real estate subsidiary, SunCor, began disposing of
its homebuilding operations, master-planned communities, land parcels, commercial assets and golf
courses in order to reduce its outstanding debt. All activity for the 2010 income statement and
prior comparative period income statement amounts were reclassified to discontinued operations. In
2008, 2009 and 2010, SunCor recorded real estate impairment charges (see Note 23). SunCor’s asset
sales resulted in no gain for 2010 and 2009 due to the impairment charges discussed above, and a
$24 million after tax gain in 2008. At December 31, 2010, SunCor had approximately $3 million of
assets on its balance sheet classified as assets held for sale which are included in other current
assets.

Silverhawk

— Includes activities related to the resolution of certain tax issues in 2008
associated with the sale of Silverhawk in 2005.

APSES

(other)

—

In 2010, our subsidiary, APSES, sold its district cooling business consisting
of operations in downtown Phoenix, Tucson, and on certain Arizona State University campuses. As a
result of the sale, we recorded an after-tax gain from discontinued operations of approximately $25
million in June 2010. Prior period income statement amounts related to this sale and the associated
revenues and costs are reflected in discontinued operations in 2010, 2009, and 2008. APSES also
includes activities related to the APSES discontinued commodity-related energy services in 2008,
and the associated revenues and costs that were reclassified to discontinued operations in 2008.

The following table provides revenue, income (loss) before income taxes and income (loss)

23. Real Estate Impairment Charge

In 2009, SunCor undertook and completed a review of its assets and strategies within its
various markets as a result of the distressed conditions in real estate and credit markets. Based
on the results of the review, on March 27, 2009, SunCor’s Board of Directors authorized a series of
strategic transactions to dispose of SunCor’s homebuilding operations, master-planned communities,
land parcels, commercial assets and golf courses in order to reduce SunCor’s outstanding debt. As
a result, SunCor took impairment charges in 2008, 2009 and 2010. All SunCor’s operations are
reflected in discontinued operations (see Note 22). The detail of the impairment charge is as

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

(ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY)

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), for Arizona Public
Service Company. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation
under the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework,

our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010. The effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
which is included herein and also relates to the Company’s financial statements.

February 18, 2011



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of

Arizona Public Service Company

Phoenix, Arizona

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Arizona
Public Service Company and subsidiary (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income,
changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. We
also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to
the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

As disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of Pinnacle West Capital
Corporation, the Company adopted amended accounting guidance related to the consolidation of
variable interest entities on January 1, 2010.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

S-1. Income Taxes

APS is included in Pinnacle West’s consolidated tax return. However, when Pinnacle West
allocates income taxes to APS, it is done based upon APS’s taxable income computed on a stand-alone
basis, in accordance with the tax sharing agreement.

Certain assets and liabilities are reported differently for income tax purposes than they are
for financial statements purposes. The tax effect of these differences is recorded as deferred
taxes. We calculate deferred taxes using the current income tax rates.

APS has recorded regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities related to income taxes on its
Balance Sheets in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated operations. The regulatory
assets are for certain temporary differences, primarily the allowance for equity funds used during
construction and pension and other postretirement benefits. The regulatory liabilities relate to
deferred taxes resulting primarily from investment tax credits. APS amortizes these amounts as the
differences reverse.

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits,
excluding interest and penalties, at the beginning and end of the year that are included in accrued
taxes and unrecognized tax benefits (dollars in thousands):

During the first quarter of 2010, the Company reached a settlement with the IRS with regard to
the examination of tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2005 through 2007. As a result of
this settlement, net uncertain tax positions decreased $62 million, including approximately $3
million which decreased our effective tax rate. Additionally, the settlement resulted in the
recognition of net interest benefits of approximately $4 million through the effective tax rate.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
approximately $6 million, $15 million and $15 million, respectively, of tax positions that, if
recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate.



ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

As of the balance sheet date, the tax year ended December 31, 2008 and all subsequent tax
years remain subject to examination by the IRS. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to
state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 1999. We do not anticipate that
there will be any significant increases or decreases in our unrecognized tax benefits within
the next twelve months.

We reflect interest and penalties, if any, on unrecognized tax benefits in the statement of
income as income tax expense. The amount of interest recognized in the Statement of Income related
to unrecognized tax benefits was a pre-tax benefit of $2 million for 2010, a pre-tax expense of $2
million for 2009 and a pre-tax benefit of $51 million for 2008.

The total amount of accrued liabilities for interest recognized in the Balance Sheets related
to unrecognized tax benefits was $6 million as of December 31, 2010, $8 million as of December 31,
2009 and $5 million as of December 31, 2008. To the extent that matters are settled favorably,
this amount could reverse and decrease our effective tax rate. Additionally, as of December 31,
2010, we have recognized $5 million of interest income to be received on the overpayment of income
taxes for certain adjustments that we have filed, or will file, with the IRS.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS

ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term “disclosure controls and procedures” means controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) (15 U.S.C.
78a

et seq

.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a
company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Pinnacle West’s management, with the participation of Pinnacle West’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of Pinnacle West’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2010. Based on that evaluation, Pinnacle West’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of that date, Pinnacle West’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

APS’s management, with the participation of APS’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of APS’s disclosure controls and procedures as of
December 31, 2010. Based on that evaluation, APS’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that, as of that date, APS’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective.

(b) Management’s Annual Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Reference is made to “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
(Pinnacle West Capital Corporation)” on page 80 of this report and “Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting (Arizona Public Service Company)” on page 153 of this report.

(c) Attestation Reports of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

Reference is made to “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” on page 81 of
this report and “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” on page 154 of this
report on the internal control over financial reporting of Pinnacle West and APS, respectively.

(d) Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The term “internal control over financial reporting” (defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(f)) refers to
the process of a company that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP.



No change in Pinnacle West’s or APS’s internal control over financial reporting occurred
during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2010 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, Pinnacle West’s or APS’s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

None.

PART III

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF PINNACLE WEST

Reference is hereby made to “Information About Our Board and Corporate Governance,” “Proposal
1 — Election of Directors” and to “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance” in the
Pinnacle West Proxy Statement relating to the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 18,
2011 (the “2011 Proxy Statement”) and to the “Executive Officers of Pinnacle West” section in Part
I of this report.

Pinnacle West has adopted a Code of Ethics for Financial Executives that applies to financial
executives including Pinnacle West’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief
Accounting Officer, Controller, Treasurer, and persons holding substantially equivalent positions
at Pinnacle West’s subsidiaries. The Code of Ethics for Financial Executives is posted on Pinnacle
West’s website at

www.pinnaclewest.com

. Pinnacle West intends to satisfy the requirements under
Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding disclosure of amendments to, or waivers from, provisions of the
Code of Ethics for Financial Executives by posting such information on Pinnacle West’s website.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Reference is hereby made to “Directors’ Compensation,” “Report of the Human Resources
Committee,” “Executive Compensation,” “Overall Compensation Program” and “Human Resources Committee
Interlocks and Insider Participation” in the 2011 Proxy Statement.

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF

CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Reference is hereby made to “Shares of Pinnacle West Stock Owned by Management and Large

This amount includes shares subject to outstanding options as well as shares subject
to outstanding performance share awards and restricted stock unit awards at the maximum amount of
shares issuable under such awards. However, payout of the performance share awards is contingent
on the Company reaching certain levels of performance during a three-year performance period. If
the performance criteria for these awards are not fully satisfied, the award recipient will receive
less than the maximum number of shares available under these grants and may receive nothing from
these grants.


The weighted average exercise price in this column does not take performance share
awards or restricted stock unit awards into account, as those awards have no exercise price.


Awards can take the form of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance shares, performance share units, performance cash, stock grants, dividend equivalents,
and restricted stock units.

Equity Compensation Plans Approved By Security Holders

Amounts in column (a) in the table above include shares subject to awards outstanding under
three equity compensation plans that were approved by our shareholders: (a) the Pinnacle West
Capital Corporation 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan, under which no new stock awards may be granted;
(b) the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2002 Plan”), under
which no new stock awards may be granted; and (c) the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2007
Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”), which was approved by our shareholders at our 2007
annual meeting of shareholders. Although we cannot issue additional awards under the 2002 Plan,
shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2002 Plan that expire or are cancelled or terminated
will be available for issuance under the 2007 Plan. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding these plans.



Equity Compensation Plans Not Approved By Security Holders

The Company does not have any equity compensation plans under which shares can still be issued
that have not been approved by shareholders.

DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
