PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Pinnacle West

Pinnacle West is a holding company that conducts business through its subsidiaries. We derive
the majority of our revenues and earnings from our wholly-owned subsidiary, APS. APS is a
vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to
most of the State of Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix
metropolitan area, the Tucson metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona.

Pinnacle West’s other first-tier subsidiaries are SunCor, APSES and El Dorado. Additional
information related to these businesses is provided later in this report.

Our reportable business segments are the regulated electricity segment, which consists of
traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electric service to
Native Load customers) and related activities, and includes electricity generation, transmission
and distribution, and the real estate segment, which consists of real estate development and
investment activities in the western United States.

Due to the continuing distressed conditions in the real estate markets, in 2009 our
real-estate subsidiary, SunCor, undertook a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations,
master-planned communities, land parcels, commercial assets and golf courses in order to eliminate
its outstanding debt. As a part of this plan to sell substantially all of SunCor’s assets, the
real estate segment may no longer be a reporting segment in the future. See Note 17 for financial
information of our business segments.

BUSINESS OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

APS currently provides electric service to approximately 1.1 million customers. We own or
lease more than 6,280 MW of regulated generation capacity and we hold a mix of both long-term and
short-term power purchase agreements for additional capacity, including a variety of agreements for
the purchase of renewable energy. During 2009, no single purchaser or user of energy accounted for
more than 1.1% of our electric revenues.



The following map shows APS’ retail service territory, including the locations of its
generating facilities and principal transmission lines.

Energy Sources and Resource Planning

To serve its customers, APS obtains power through its various generation stations and through
power purchase agreements. Resource planning is an important function necessary to meet Arizona’s
future energy needs. APS’ sources of energy by fuel type during 2009 were: coal — 36.3%;
nuclear — 25.9%; purchased power — 20.6%; and gas, oil and other — 17.2%.

Generation Facilities

APS has ownership interests in or leases the coal, nuclear, gas, oil and solar generating
facilities described below. For additional information regarding these facilities, see Item 2.

Coal Fueled Generating Facilities

Four Corners

— Four Corners is a 5-unit coal-fired power plant located in the northwestern
corner of New Mexico. APS operates the plant and owns 100% of Four Corners Units 1, 2 and 3 and
15% of Units 4 and 5. APS has a total entitlement from Four Corners of 785 MW. The Four Corners
plant site is leased from the Navajo Nation and is also subject to an easement from the
federal government. See “Plant and Transmission Line Leases and Easements on Indian Lands” in Item
2 for additional information. APS purchases all of Four Corners’ coal requirements from a supplier
with a long-term lease of coal reserves with the Navajo Nation. The Four Corners coal contract
runs through 2016.



Cholla

— Cholla is a 4-unit coal-fired power plant located in northeastern Arizona. APS
operates the plant and owns 100% of Cholla Units 1, 2 and 3. PacifiCorp owns Cholla Unit 4 and APS
operates that unit for PacifiCorp. APS has a total entitlement from Cholla of 647 MW. APS
purchases all of Cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines all of the coal under
long-term leases of coal reserves with the federal government and private landholders. The Cholla
coal contract runs through 2024. APS has the ability under the contract to reduce its annual coal
commitment and purchase a portion of Cholla’s coal requirements on the spot market to take
advantage of competitive pricing options and to purchase coal required for increased operating
capacity. APS believes that the current fuel contracts and competitive fuel supply options ensure
the continued operation of Cholla for its useful life. In addition, APS has a long-term coal
transportation contract.

Navajo Generating Station

— The Navajo Plant is a 3-unit coal-fired power plant located in
northern Arizona. Salt River Project operates the plant and APS owns a 14% interest in Navajo
Units 1, 2 and 3. APS has a total entitlement from the Navajo Plant of 315 MW. The Navajo Plant’s
coal requirements are purchased from a supplier with long-term leases from the Navajo Nation and
the Hopi Tribe. The Navajo Plant is under contract with its coal supplier through 2011, with
options to extend through 2019. The Navajo Plant site is leased from the Navajo Nation and is also
subject to an easement from the federal government. See “Plant and Transmission Line Leases and
Easements on Indian Lands” in Item 2 for additional information.

These coal plants face uncertainties related to existing and potential legislation and
regulation that could significantly impact their economics and operations. See “Environmental
Matters” below and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Capital Expenditures” in Item 7 for environmental and climate change developments
impacting these coal facilities. See Note 11 for information regarding APS’ coal mine reclamation
obligations.

Nuclear

Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station —

Palo Verde is a nuclear power plant located about 50
miles west of Phoenix, Arizona. APS operates the plant and owns 29.1% of Palo Verde Units 1 and 3
and about 17% of Unit 2. In addition, APS leases about 12.1% of Unit 2, resulting in a 29.1%
combined interest in that Unit. APS has a total entitlement from Palo Verde of 1,146 MW.

Palo Verde Leases —

In 1986, APS sold about 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain
common facilities in three separate sale leaseback transactions. APS accounts for these leases as
operating leases. The leases, which have terms of 29.5 years, contain options to renew the leases
or to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms. APS must give
notice to the respective lessors between December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2012 if it wishes to
exercise, or not exercise, either of these options. We are analyzing these options. See Notes 9
and 20 for additional information regarding the Palo Verde Unit 2 sale leaseback transactions.



Palo Verde Operating Licenses

—

Operation of each of the three Palo Verde units requires an
operating license from the NRC. The NRC issued full power operating licenses for Unit 1 in June
1985, Unit 2 in April 1986 and Unit 3 in November 1987. The full power operating licenses,
each valid for a period of 40 years, authorize APS, as operating agent for Palo Verde, to operate
the three Palo Verde units at full power. On December 15, 2008, APS applied for renewed operating
licenses for the Palo Verde units for a period of 20 years beyond the expirations of the current
licenses. The current NRC schedule for the applications estimates a final decision in the fall of
2011. APS is making preparations to secure resources necessary to operate the plant for the period
of extended operation.

Palo Verde Fuel Cycle —

The fuel cycle for Palo Verde is comprised of the following stages:

•

mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates;

•

conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride;

•

enrichment of uranium hexafluoride;

•

fabrication of fuel assemblies;

•

utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors; and

•

storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.

The Palo Verde participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource
needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs. The Palo Verde participants have
contracted for all of Palo Verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2011. New
contracts are currently being negotiated that would meet the plant’s conversion services needs
through 2011, taking into account available inventory. The participants have also contracted for
all of Palo Verde’s enrichment services through 2013 and all of Palo Verde’s fuel assembly
fabrication services until at least 2015.

Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal —

Palo Verde has sufficient capacity at its on-site
independent spent fuel storage installation (“ISFSI”) to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be
irradiated during the initial operating license period, through 2027. Additionally, Palo Verde has
sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated
during the period of extended operation. If uncertainties regarding the United States government’s
obligation to accept and store used fuel are not favorably resolved, APS will evaluate alternative
storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the ISFSI to accommodate all of the fuel that
will be irradiated during the period of extended operation. See “Palo Verde Nuclear Generating
Station” in Note 11 for a discussion of spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal.

NRC Inspection —

On February 22, 2007, the NRC issued a “white” finding (low to moderate safety
significance) due to electrical output issues with the Unit 3 emergency diesel generator that
occurred in 2006. Under the NRC’s Action Matrix, this finding, coupled with a previous NRC
“yellow” finding relating to a 2004 matter involving Palo Verde’s safety injection systems,
resulted in Palo Verde Unit 3 being placed in the “multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone” column
of the NRC’s Action Matrix (“Column 4”), subjecting it to an enhanced NRC inspection regime.
Although only Palo Verde Unit 3 was in NRC’s Column 4, in order to adequately assess the need for
improvements, APS’ management conducted site-wide assessments of equipment and operations.

On March 24, 2009, the NRC informed APS that it was removing Palo Verde Unit 3 from Column 4,
removing Units 1 and 2 from the “one degraded cornerstone” column (“Column 3”) of the NRC’s Action
Matrix, and returning all three units of the plant to “Column
1” routine inspection and oversight by the NRC.
This notification followed the NRC’s completion of its inspections of the corrective actions taken
by Palo Verde to address the performance deficiencies that caused the NRC to place Unit 3 into
Column 4 and Units 1 and 2 into Column 3.



Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

— APS currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to
meet the NRC financial assurance requirements for its interests in Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3.
The decommissioning costs of Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3 are currently included in APS’ ACC
jurisdictional rates. Decommissioning costs are recoverable through a non-bypassable system
benefits charge, which allows APS to maintain its external sinking fund mechanism. See Note 12 for
additional information about APS’ nuclear decommissioning costs.

Palo Verde Liability and Insurance Matters

— See “Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station —
Nuclear Insurance” in Note 11 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the Palo Verde
participants, including APS, for Palo Verde.

Natural Gas and Oil Fueled Generating Facilities

APS has six natural gas power plants located throughout Arizona, consisting of Redhawk,
located near the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station; Ocotillo, located in Tempe; Sundance,
located in Coolidge; West Phoenix, located in southwest Phoenix; Saguaro, located north of Tucson;
and Yucca, located near Yuma. Several of the units at Saguaro and Yucca run on either gas or oil.
APS has one oil power plant, Douglas, located in the town of Douglas, Arizona. APS owns and
operates each of these plants with the exception of one combustion turbine unit and one steam unit
at Yucca that are operated by APS and owned by the Imperial Irrigation District. APS has a total
entitlement from these plants of 3,389 MW. Gas for these plants is acquired through APS’ hedging
program. APS has long-term gas transportation agreements with three different companies, which
provide APS with fuel delivery through 2024. Fuel oil is acquired under short-term purchases
delivered primarily to West Phoenix, where it is distributed to APS’ other oil power plants by
truck.

Solar Facilities

APS owns and operates more than thirty on-grid and off-grid small solar systems around the
state. Together they have the capacity to produce about 6 MW of renewable energy. This fleet of
solar systems is anchored by a 3 MW facility located at the Prescott Airport and a 1 MW facility
located at APS’ Saguaro power plant.

Purchased Power Contracts

In addition to its own available generating capacity, APS purchases electricity under various
arrangements, including long-term contracts and purchases through short-term markets to supplement
its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements. A substantial portion of APS’
purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
(See Note 18.) APS continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure
system reliability. APS does not expect to require new conventional generation sources sooner than
2017, due to planned additions of renewable resources and energy efficiency initiatives.

Purchased Power Capacity —

APS’ purchased power capacity under long-term contracts, including
its renewable energy portfolio, is summarized in the tables below. All capacity values are based

Current and Future Resources

Current Demand and Reserve Margin

Electric power demand is generally seasonal. In Arizona, demand for power peaks during the
hot summer months. APS’ 2009 peak one-hour demand on its electric system was recorded on July 27,
2009 at 7,218 MW, compared to the 2008 peak of 7,026 MW recorded on August 1, 2008. APS’ operable
generating capacity, together with firm purchases totaling 2,657 MW, including short-term seasonal
purchases and unit contingent purchases, resulted in an actual reserve margin, at the time of the
2009 peak demand, of 15.6%. The power actually available to APS from its resources fluctuates from
time to time due in part to planned and unplanned plant and transmission outages and technical
problems.

Future Resources and Resource Plan

On January 29, 2009, APS submitted a Resource Plan Report to the ACC proposing a diverse
portfolio of generation resources to address the projected 60% increase in customer peak demand by
2025, which equates to approximately 6,500 MW of new capacity resources and accounts for both new
resources needed to meet growing customer loads as well as resources that will be needed to
replace expiring long-term purchases.

On December 15, 2009, the ACC approved a modified resource planning rule that requires APS to
file by April 1

st

of each even year its resource plans for the next fifteen-year period.
The ACC’s modified rule also requires APS to file its first resource plan within 120 days after
the rule becomes effective. APS believes the modified rule will likely become effective by
mid-2010, requiring APS to file a revised resource plan by the Fall of 2010, which will supercede
the January 2009 filing. The modified rule also requires the ACC to issue an order with its
acknowledgment of APS’ resource plan within approximately nine months following its submittal.



Renewable Energy Standard

In connection with its ongoing resource planning efforts, APS continues to focus on increasing
the percentage of its energy that is produced by renewable resources. In 2006, the ACC adopted the
Arizona Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff (the “Renewable Energy Standard” or “RES”). Under the
Renewable Energy Standard, electric utilities that are regulated by the ACC must supply an
increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources,
including solar, wind, biomass, biogas and geothermal technologies. The renewable energy
requirement is 2.5% of retail electric sales in 2010 and increases annually until it reaches 15% in
2025. In APS’ recent retail rate case settlement agreement, APS committed to, among other things,
an interim renewable energy target of 10% by year-end 2015, which is double the existing RES target
of 5% for that year. (See Note 3.) A component of the original RES is focused on stimulating
development of distributed energy systems (generally speaking, small-scale renewable technologies
that are located on customers’ properties). Accordingly, under the original RES, an increasing
percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources. This
distributed energy requirement is 20% of the overall RES requirement of 2.5% in 2010 and increases
to 30% of the applicable RES requirement in 2012 and subsequent years. The following table
summarizes these requirement standards and their timing:

via owned or contracted renewable generation facilities and an additional installed capacity of 21
MW equivalent of customer-sited distribution energy systems in operation. These current renewable
generation projects are either APS-owned solar facilities, as described under “Generation
Facilities — Solar Facilities” above, are acquired through long-term purchased power agreements, as
described under “Purchased Power Contracts” above, or are partially funded by renewable incentives
we offer to our customers. APS continues to actively consider opportunities to enhance its
renewable energy portfolio, both to ensure its compliance with the Renewable Energy Standard and to
meet the needs of its customer base.

Demand Side Management and Energy Efficiency

Arizona regulators are placing an increased focus on energy efficiency and demand side
management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy, while incentivizing utilities to aid
in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy. In December 2009, the ACC initiated
Energy Efficiency rulemaking, with a proposed Energy Efficiency Standard of 22% annual energy
savings by 2020. An ambitious standard, such as that proposed, will likely increase participation
by APS customers in these conservation and energy efficiency programs, which in turn will likely
impact Arizona’s future energy resource needs. Energy Efficiency Rules are expected to be formally
adopted in 2010. (See Note 3 for demand side management and energy efficiency obligations
resulting from APS’ recent retail rate case settlement.)

Economic Stimulus Projects

Through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”), the Federal government is
making a number of programs available for utilities to develop renewable resources, improve
reliability and create jobs from the availability of economic stimulus funding. Certain programs
are also available through the State of Arizona.

In 2009, the DOE announced an ARRA commitment to fund the majority of a carbon dioxide
emission reduction research and development project in the amount of $70.5 million, which will be
located at our Cholla power plant. It also announced a commitment to fund, subject to final
negotiations, a $3.3 million high penetration photovoltaic generation study related to a proposed
APS community power project in Flagstaff, Arizona. These funding amounts are contingent upon
meeting certain project milestones, including DOE-established budget parameters, over the next four
years.



APS has also been selected by the State of Arizona’s Department of Commerce as a sub-recipient
under the State’s ARRA award for the implementation of various distributed energy and
energy efficiency programs in Arizona. The State is in final negotiations to provide APS with
approximately $3.7 million from the State’s ARRA grant so that APS can implement certain solar
water heater, photovoltaic and/or wind energy related community projects.

APS intends to continue to evaluate additional funding opportunities under the ARRA programs
that may be of benefit to APS’ business, operations or community activities.

Competitive Environment and Regulatory Oversight

Retail

The ACC regulates APS’ retail electric rates and its issuance of securities. The ACC must
also approve any transfer or encumbrance of APS’ property used to provide retail electric service
and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between Pinnacle West, APS and
their respective affiliates.

APS is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investor-owned electric and gas
utilities in Arizona (such as Southwest Gas Corporation), as well as cooperatives, municipalities,
electrical districts and similar types of governmental or non-profit organizations. In addition,
some customers, particularly industrial and large commercial customers, may own and operate
generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements. This practice is
becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as roof top solar
panels to meet or supplement their energy needs.

In 1999, the ACC approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in
Arizona. As a result, as of January 1, 2001, all of APS’ retail customers were eligible to choose
alternate energy suppliers. However, there are currently no active retail competitors offering
unbundled energy or other utility services to APS’ customers. In 2000, an Arizona Superior Court
found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects unlawful, the latter
finding being primarily on procedural grounds, and invalidated all ACC orders authorizing
competitive electric services providers to operate in Arizona. In 2004, the Arizona Court of
Appeals invalidated some, but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the orders
authorizing competitive electric service providers. In 2005, the Arizona Supreme Court declined to
review the Court of Appeals decision.

To date, the ACC has taken no further or substantive action on either the rules or the prior
orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to the final Court of Appeals
decision. However, as a result of a new request for authorization to provide competitive retail
electric service by Sempra Energy Solutions, LLC, the ACC directed the ACC staff to investigate
whether such retail competition was in the public interest and what legal impediments remain to
competition in light of the Court of Appeals decision referenced above. The ACC staff’s report on
the results of its investigation is due to be filed with the ACC on April 1, 2010. At present,
only limited electric retail competition exists in Arizona and only with certain entities not
regulated by the ACC.

Currently, there are two matters pending with the ACC that involve a business model where
customers pay solar vendors for the installation and operation of solar facilities based on the
amount of energy produced. The ACC must make a determination whether these entities would be
considered “public service corporations” under the Arizona Constitution, causing them to be
regulated by the ACC. Use of such products by customers within our territory would result in some
level of competition; however, at this time we do not feel this would materially impact our
financial results. APS cannot predict when, and the extent to which, additional electric service providers will
enter or re-enter APS’ service territory.



Wholesale

The FERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services. (See Note 3 for
information regarding APS’ transmission rates.) During 2009, approximately 4.8% of APS’ electric
operating revenues resulted from such sales and services. APS’ wholesale activity primarily
consists of managing fuel and purchased power risks in connection with the costs of serving retail
customer energy requirements. APS also sells, in the wholesale market, its generation output that
is not needed for APS’ Native Load and, in doing so, competes with other utilities, power marketers
and independent power producers. Additionally, subject to specified parameters, APS markets,
hedges and trades in electricity and fuels.

Environmental Matters

Climate Change

Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives.

In the past several years, the United States Congress
has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions. On June 26, 2009, the
House of Representatives approved the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, H.R. 2454.
In addition to establishing clean energy programs, H.R. 2454 would establish a greenhouse gas
emission cap-and-trade system starting in 2012 applicable to about 85% of all emission sources in
the nation. A similar bill (Kerry-Boxer Bill, S. 1733) is pending before the Senate. Both of
these bills would allocate a certain number of allowances to local distribution companies (such as
APS) through 2030.

To the extent APS’ emissions exceed the allowances allocated to it under these proposed bills,
APS would have an “allowance gap.” APS would have to purchase enough allowances from the market to
fill these gaps. The table below illustrates the estimated cost impacts to APS in 2012 to acquire
allowances to fill its allowance gap, and the associated retail rate impacts to customers under
H.R. 2454 and S. 1733. For purposes of this illustration, the table provides three assumed
allowance prices of $20, $50 and $75 per metric ton.

The actual economic and operational impact of this or any similar legislation on the Company
depends on a variety of factors, none of which can be fully known until such legislation passes and
the specifics of the resulting program are established. These factors include the terms of the
legislation with regard to allowed emissions; whether the permitted emissions allowances will be
allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned; the cost to reduce emissions or buy
allowances in the marketplace; and the availability of offsets and mitigating factors to moderate
the costs of compliance. At the present time, we cannot predict what form of legislation, if any,
will ultimately pass.



The EPA recently determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare.
This determination was made in response to a 2007 United States Supreme Court ruling that
greenhouse gases fit within the Clean Air Act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and, as a
result, the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under
the Clean Air Act. The recent endangerment finding could result in the EPA issuing new regulatory
requirements under the Clean Air Act for new and modified major greenhouse gas emitting sources,
including power plants. On September 30, 2009, the EPA announced a proposed rule under the Clean
Air Act requiring certain new and modified stationary sources, including power plants, to use the
best available control technology to minimize greenhouse gas
emissions. Several groups have filed lawsuits challenging the
EPA’s endangerment finding. At the present time we
cannot predict whether the proposed stationary source rule will be adopted in its current or a
revised form, what other rules or regulations may ultimately result
from the EPA’s finding, whether the parties challenging the
endangerment finding will be successful, and
what impact the proposed rule and potential other rules or regulations will have on APS’
operations.

In anticipation of potential future regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act as
described above, on September 22, 2009, the EPA issued a mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule.
The rule applies to direct greenhouse gas emissions from facilities such as APS’ power plants. We
expect that our incremental costs to comply with this rule will be immaterial since APS already
routinely reports CO


and other greenhouse gas emissions from its plants.

In addition to federal legislative initiatives, state specific initiatives may also impact our
business. While Arizona has not yet enacted any state specific legislation regarding greenhouse
gas emissions, the California legislature enacted AB 32 and SB 1368 in 2006 to address greenhouse
gas emissions and New Mexico is currently considering proposed legislation to address these issues.
We are monitoring these and other state legislative developments to understand the
extent to which they may affect our business, including our sales into the impacted states or the
ability of our out-of-state power plant participants to continue their
participation in certain coal-fired power plants.

If any emission reduction legislation or regulations are enacted, we will assess our
compliance alternatives, which may include replacement of existing equipment, installation of
additional pollution control equipment, purchase of allowances, retirement or suspension of
operations at certain coal-fired facilities, or other actions. Although associated capital
expenditures or operating costs resulting from greenhouse gas emission regulations or legislation
could be material, we believe that we would be able to recover the costs of these environmental
compliance initiatives through our rates.

Regional Initiative

.

In 2007, six western states (Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oregon,
Utah and Washington) and two Canadian provinces (British Columbia and Manitoba) entered into an
accord, the Western Climate Initiative (“WCI”), to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles
and certain industries, including utilities. Montana, Quebec and Ontario have also joined WCI.
WCI participants set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 15% below 2005 levels by 2020.
After soliciting public comment, in September 2008 WCI issued the design of a cap-and-trade program
for greenhouse gas emissions. Due in part
to the recent activity at the federal level discussed above, the initiative’s momentum and the
movement toward detailed proposed rules has slowed. On February 2,
2010, Arizona’s Governor issued an executive order stating that
Arizona will continue to be a member of WCI to monitor its
advancements in this area, but it will not implement the WCI regional cap-and-trade program. As a
result, while we continue to monitor the progress of WCI, at the
present time we do not believe it will have a material impact on our operations.



Company Response to Climate Change Initiatives

.

We have undertaken a number of initiatives to
address emission concerns, including renewable energy procurement and development, promotion of
programs and rates that promote energy conservation, renewable energy use and energy efficiency,
and implementation of an active technology innovation effort to evaluate potential emerging new
technologies. APS currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources including wind,
geothermal, solar and biomass and we are focused on increasing the percentage of our energy that is
produced by renewable resources.

On May 18, 2009, we submitted a comprehensive Climate Change Management Plan to the ACC to
comply with an ACC order that directed APS to undertake a climate management plan, carbon emission
reduction study and commitment and action plan with public input and ACC review. The Climate
Change Management Plan details scientific, legislative and policy issues, potential physical and
financial risks to APS, greenhouse gas emission inventory, APS technology innovation and greenhouse
gas reduction efforts, and our companies’ strategic approach to climate change management.

In January 2008, APS joined the Climate Registry as a Founding Reporter. Founding Reporters
are companies that voluntarily joined the non-profit organization before May 2008 to measure and
report greenhouse gas emissions in a common, accurate and transparent manner consistent across
industry sectors and borders. APS will not participate in the Climate Registry after 2009 because
we will be reporting substantially the same information under the new EPA reporting rule. Pinnacle
West has also reported, and will continue to report, greenhouse gas emissions in its annual
Corporate Responsibility Report, which is available on our website

(

www.pinnaclewest.com

)

.
In addition to emissions data, the report provides information related to the Company, its approach
to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance, as well as a copy of our Climate
Change Management Plan discussed above. The information on Pinnacle West’s website, including the
Corporate Responsibility Report, is not incorporated by reference into this report.

Climate Change Lawsuits.

In February 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of
Kivalina, Alaska filed a lawsuit in federal court in the Northern District of California against
nine oil companies, fourteen power companies (including Pinnacle West), and a coal company,
alleging that the defendants’ emissions of carbon dioxide contribute to global warming and
constitute a public and private nuisance. The plaintiffs also allege that the effects of global
warming will require the relocation of the village and they are seeking an unspecified amount of
monetary damages. In June 2008, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the action, which were
granted. The plaintiffs filed an appeal with the court in November 2009. We believe the action is
without merit and intend to continue to defend against the claims.

Similar nuisance lawsuits are currently pending in the 2nd and 5th Circuits. In the fall of
2009, the U.S. Courts of Appeals for each of these Circuits reversed lower court decisions and
ruled that the plaintiffs in both cases could bring common law nuisance lawsuits against
coal-burning utilities allegedly contributing to global warming. Both cases, as well as the
Kivalina case, raise political and legal considerations, including whether the courts can or should
be making climate change policy
decisions. We are not a party to either of these two lawsuits, but will monitor these developments
and their potential industry impacts.



EPA Environmental Regulation

Regional Haze Rules.

Over a decade ago, the EPA announced regional haze rules to reduce
visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas. The rules require states (or, for
sources located on tribal land, the EPA) to determine what pollution control technologies
constitute the “best available retrofit technology” (“BART”) for certain older major stationary
sources. The EPA subsequently issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule, which provides guidelines on
how to perform a BART analysis.

ADEQ is currently undertaking a rulemaking process to address the Clean Air Visibility Rule
requirements. ADEQ’s rules were due to EPA Region 9 in December 2007, but are expected to be
submitted in 2010. As part of the rulemaking process, ADEQ required APS to perform a BART analysis
for Cholla. APS completed a BART analysis for Cholla and submitted its BART recommendations to
ADEQ on February 4, 2008. The recommendations include the installation of certain pollution
control equipment that APS believes constitutes BART. Once APS receives ADEQ’s final determination
as to what constitutes BART for Cholla, we will have five years to complete the installation of the
equipment and to achieve the emission limits established by ADEQ. However, in order to coordinate
with the plant’s other scheduled activities, APS is currently implementing portions of its
recommended plan for Cholla on a voluntary basis. Costs related to the implementation of these
portions of our recommended plan are included in our environmental expenditure estimates (see
“Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Capital Expenditures” in Item 7).

EPA Region 9 requested that APS, as the operating agent for Four Corners, and SRP, as the
operating agent for the Navajo Plant, perform a BART analysis for Four Corners and the Navajo
Plant, respectively. APS and SRP each submitted an analysis to the EPA concluding that certain
combustion control equipment constitutes BART for these plants. Based on the analyses and comments
received through EPA’s rulemaking process, the EPA will determine what it believes constitutes BART
for each plant.

The EPA recently issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) seeking public
comments on what constitutes BART for each plant. The public comment period expired in October,
2009, but the EPA has extended the comment period until March 20, 2010 for the Navajo and Hopi
Tribes. We expect that the EPA will issue proposed and final BART determinations for Four Corners
and the Navajo Plant in 2010. The participant owners of Four Corners and the Navajo Plant will
have five years after the EPA issues its final determination to achieve compliance with their
respective BART requirements. In addition, on February 16, 2010, a
group of environmental organizations filed a petition with the
Departments of Interior and Agriculture requesting those agencies to
certify to the EPA that visibility impairment in sixteen national
park and wilderness areas is reasonably attributable to emissions
from Four Corners. If the agencies certify impairment, the EPA is
required to evaluate and, if necessary, determine BART for Four
Corners.

APS’ recommended plan for Four Corners includes the installation of combustion control
equipment, with an estimated cost to APS, based on preliminary engineering estimates and APS’ Four
Corners ownership interest, of approximately $50 million. If the EPA determines that
post-combustion controls are required, APS’ total costs could be up to approximately $422 million
for Four Corners. SRP’s recommended plan for the Navajo Plant includes the installation of
combustion control equipment, with an estimated cost to APS of approximately $6 million based on
APS’ Navajo ownership interest. If the EPA determines that post-combustion controls are required,
APS’ total costs could be up to approximately $93 million for Navajo. The Four Corners and Navajo
Plant participants’ obligations to comply with the EPA’s final BART determinations, coupled with
the financial impact of
future climate change legislation, other environmental regulations and other business
considerations, could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of
individual participants to continue their participation in these plants.



In order to coordinate with each plant’s other scheduled activities, the plants are currently
implementing portions of their recommended plans described above on a voluntary basis. APS’ share
of the costs related to the implementation of these portions of the recommended plans are included
in our environmental expenditure estimates (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Expenditures” in Item 7).

Mercury and other Hazardous Air Pollutants.

In early 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
D.C. Circuit vacated the Clean Air Mercury Rule (“CAMR”), which was adopted by the EPA to regulate
mercury emissions from coal fired power plants. As a result, the law in effect prior to the
adoption of the CAMR became the applicable law, and the EPA is now required to adopt final maximum
achievable control technology emissions (“MACT”) standards. Under a proposed consent decree, the
EPA has agreed to issue final MACT standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants by
November 2011. If the consent decree is finalized in its current form, APS will have three years
after the EPA issues its final rule to achieve compliance, which would likely require APS to
install additional pollution control equipment.

APS has installed, and continues to install, certain of the equipment necessary to meet the
anticipated standards. The estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next three years for
such equipment are included in our environmental expenditure estimates (see “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Expenditures” in
Item 7).

Federal Implementation Plan (“FIP”).

In September 1999, the EPA proposed FIPs to set air
quality standards at certain power plants, including Four Corners and the Navajo Plant, which it
later revised in 2006. The FIP for Four Corners was finalized in 2009, and we do not believe
compliance with its required limits will have a material adverse impact on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. The proposed FIP for the Navajo Plant is still pending. APS
cannot currently predict the effect of this proposed FIP on its financial position, results of
operations or cash flows, or whether the proposed FIP will be adopted in its current form.

Coal Combustion Waste.

The EPA is expected to issue proposed regulations governing the
handling and disposal of coal combustion byproducts (“CCBs”), such as fly ash and bottom ash. APS
currently disposes of CCBs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at Cholla and Four Corners, and also
sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete production. The
EPA is evaluating options that include regulation of CCBs under non-hazardous waste standards,
hazardous waste standards, or a combination of both, and a potential phase out of the disposal of
CCBs through the use of ash ponds. A proposed rule is expected during the first quarter of 2010.
We do not know when the EPA will issue a final rule, including required compliance dates. While
APS continues to advocate for the regulation of CCBs as non-hazardous waste, we cannot currently
predict the outcome of the EPA’s actions and whether such actions will have a material adverse
impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Section 114 Request

.

On April 6, 2009, APS received a request from the EPA under Section 114
of the Clean Air Act seeking detailed information regarding projects at and operations of Four
Corners. This request is part of an enforcement initiative that the EPA has undertaken under the
Clean Air Act. The EPA has taken the position that many utilities have made certain physical or
operational
changes at their plants that should have triggered additional regulatory requirements under
the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act (“NSR”). Other electric utilities have
received and responded to similar Section 114 requests, and several of them have been the subject
of notices of violation and lawsuits by the EPA. APS has responded to the EPA’s request and is
currently unable to predict the timing or content of EPA’s response, if any, or any resulting
actions.



Superfund

.

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(“Superfund”) establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the
soil, water or air. Those who generated, transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a
contaminated site are among those who are PRPs. PRPs may be strictly, and often are jointly and
severally, liable for clean-up. On September 3, 2003, the EPA advised APS that the EPA considers
APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52

nd

Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 (OU3) in
Phoenix, Arizona. APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site. APS and Pinnacle West
have agreed with the EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS facilities within
OU3. In addition, on September 23, 2009, APS agreed with the EPA and one other PRP to voluntarily
assist with the funding and management of the site-wide groundwater remedial investigation and
feasibility study work plan. APS estimates that its costs related to this investigation and study
will be approximately $1.2 million, which is reserved as a liability on its financial statements.
We anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future, but because the overall
investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized, at the
present time we cannot accurately estimate our total expenditures.

By letter dated April 25, 2008, the EPA informed APS that it may be a PRP in the Gila River
Indian Reservation Superfund Site in Maricopa County, Arizona. APS, along with three other electric
utility companies, owns a parcel of property on which a transmission pole and a portion of a
transmission line are located. The property abuts the Gila River Indian Community boundary and, at
one time, may have been part of an airfield where crop dusting took place. Currently, the EPA is
only seeking payment from APS and four other PRPs for past cleanup-related costs involving
contamination from the crop dusting. Based upon the total amount of cleanup costs reported by the
EPA in its letter to APS, we do not expect that the resolution of this matter will have a material
adverse impact on APS’ financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites.

Certain properties which APS now owns or which were previously
owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of, or sites associated with,
manufactured gas plants. APS is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites. APS does not
expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations, cash flows or liquidity.

Navajo Nation Environmental Issues

Four Corners and the Navajo Plant are located on the Navajo Reservation and are held under
easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the Navajo Nation. See “Energy
Sources and Planning — Generation — Coal Fueled Generating Facilities” above for additional
information regarding these plants.

In July 1995, the Navajo Nation enacted the Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control
Act, the Navajo Nation Safe Drinking Water Act and the Navajo Nation Pesticide Act (collectively,
the “Navajo Acts”). The Navajo Acts purport to give the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection
Agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality, drinking water and
pesticide activities, including those activities that occur at Four Corners and the Navajo Plant.
On October 17, 1995, the Four Corners participants and the Navajo Plant participants each filed a
lawsuit in the District Court of the Navajo Nation, Window Rock District, challenging the
applicability of the Navajo Acts as to Four Corners and the Navajo Plant. The Court has stayed
these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties, and the parties are seeking to negotiate a
settlement.



In April 2000, the Navajo Tribal Council approved operating permit regulations under the
Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act. APS believes the Navajo Nation exceeded
its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations. On July 12, 2000, the Four Corners
participants and the Navajo Plant participants each filed a petition with the Navajo Supreme Court
for review of these regulations. Those proceedings have been stayed, pending the settlement
negotiations mentioned above. APS cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter.

On May 18, 2005, APS, Salt River Project, as the operating agent for the Navajo Plant, and the
Navajo Nation executed a Voluntary Compliance Agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the
Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act. As a result of this agreement, APS sought,
and the Courts granted, dismissal of the pending litigation in the Navajo Nation Supreme Court and
the Navajo Nation District Court, to the extent the claims relate to the Clean Air Act. The
agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other Navajo Acts. APS cannot
currently predict the outcome of this matter.

Water Supply

Assured supplies of water are important for APS’ generating plants. At the present time, APS
has adequate water to meet its needs. However, conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in
the southwestern United States have resulted in numerous court actions.

Both groundwater and surface water in areas important to APS’ operations have been the subject
of inquiries, claims and legal proceedings, which will require a number of years to resolve. APS
is one of a number of parties in a proceeding, filed March 13, 1975, before the Eleventh Judicial
District Court in New Mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for Four
Corners is derived. An agreement reached with the Navajo Nation in 1985, however, provides that if
Four Corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication, the Navajo Nation will provide, for
an agreed upon cost, sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss.

A summons served on APS in early 1986 required all water claimants in the Lower Gila River
Watershed in Arizona to assert any claims to water on or before January 20, 1987, in an action
pending in Maricopa County, Arizona, Superior Court. Palo Verde is located within the geographic
area subject to the summons. APS’ rights and the rights of the other Palo Verde participants to
the use of groundwater and effluent at Palo Verde are potentially at issue in this action. As
operating agent of Palo Verde, APS filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the Palo
Verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to Palo
Verde. Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights. Five of APS’ other power plants are
also located within the geographic area subject to the summons. APS’ claims dispute the court’s
jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants. Alternatively, APS seeks
confirmation of such rights. In November 1999, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision
confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and Indian
tribes. In addition, in September 2000, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision affirming the
lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims. Litigation on both of these issues has
continued in the trial court. In December
2005, APS and other parties filed a petition with the Arizona Supreme Court requesting
interlocutory review of a September 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining
whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights. The Court denied the petition in
May 2007, and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order. No trial
date concerning APS’ water rights claims has been set in this matter.



APS has also filed claims to water in the Little Colorado River Watershed in Arizona in an
action pending in the Apache County, Arizona, Superior Court, which was originally filed on
September 5, 1985. APS’ groundwater resource utilized at Cholla is within the geographic area
subject to the adjudication and, therefore, is potentially at issue in the case. APS’ claims
dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights. Alternatively, APS seeks
confirmation of such rights. A number of parties are in the process of settlement negotiations
with respect to certain claims in this matter. Other claims have been identified as ready for
litigation in motions filed with the court. No trial date concerning APS’ water rights claims has
been set in this matter.

Although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation, APS does not expect that the
described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of
operations, cash flows or liquidity.

The Four Corners region, in which Four Corners is located, has been experiencing drought
conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in
the watershed that supplies the area. APS is continuing to work with area stakeholders to
implement agreements to minimize the effect, if any, on future operations of the plant. The effect
of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time, and APS cannot predict the ultimate outcome,
if any, of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available,
or the price thereof, from Four Corners.

BUSINESS OF OTHER SUBSIDIARIES

SunCor

SunCor has been a developer of residential, commercial and industrial real estate projects in
Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico and Utah. Due to the continuing distressed conditions in the real
estate markets, in 2009 SunCor undertook a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations,
master-planned communities, land parcels, commercial assets and golf courses in order to eliminate
its outstanding debt.

At December 31, 2009, SunCor had total assets of about $166 million. At December 31, 2008,
SunCor had total assets of about $547 million. The reduction in SunCor’s assets is primarily due
to 2009 real estate impairment charges of $266 million and 2009 asset sales. SunCor’s remaining
assets consist primarily of land with improvements, commercial buildings, golf courses and other
real estate investments. SunCor’s remaining projects include master-planned communities and
commercial and residential projects. Four of the master-planned communities and the commercial and
residential projects are in Arizona. Other master-planned communities are located in Idaho, New
Mexico and Utah.



SunCor’s operating revenues were approximately $103 million in 2009, $75 million in 2008, and
$190 million in 2007. SunCor’s net loss attributable to common shareholders was approximately $279
million in 2009, which includes $266 million (pre-tax) in real
estate impairment charges. In 2009, income tax benefits related to
SunCor operations were recorded by Pinnacle West in accordance with
an intercompany tax sharing agreement. SunCor’s net loss attributable to common shareholders in 2008 was $26 million, which included a $53
million (pre-tax) real estate impairment charge. SunCor’s net income was approximately $24 million
in 2007. Certain components of SunCor’s real estate sales activities, which are included in the
real estate segment, are required to be reported as discontinued operations on Pinnacle West’s
Consolidated Statements of Income. (See Notes 22 and 23.)

APSES

APSES provides energy-related products and services (such as energy master planning, energy
use consultation and facility audits, cogeneration analysis and installation, and project
management) with a focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy to commercial and industrial
retail customers in the western United States. APSES also owns and operates district cooling
systems.

APSES had a net loss of $2 million in 2009, a net loss of $1 million in 2008 and a net loss of
$4 million in 2007. At December 31, 2009, APSES had total assets of $74 million.

El Dorado

El Dorado owns minority interests in several energy-related investments and Arizona
community-based ventures. El Dorado’s short-term goal is to prudently realize the value of its
existing investments. On a long-term basis, Pinnacle West may use El Dorado, when appropriate, for
investments that are strategic to the business of generating, distributing and marketing
electricity.

El Dorado had a net loss of $7 million in 2009, a net loss of $10 million in 2008 and a net
loss of $6 million in 2007. Income taxes related to El Dorado are recorded by Pinnacle West. At
December 31, 2009, El Dorado had total assets of $19 million.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection
with the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report, set forth below are
risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results. Unless otherwise indicated or the
context otherwise requires, the following risks and uncertainties apply to Pinnacle West and its
subsidiaries, including APS.

REGULATORY RISKS

Our financial condition depends upon APS’ ability to recover costs in a timely manner from
customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy.

APS is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal, state and local regulatory
agencies that significantly influence its business, liquidity, results of operations and its
ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner. The ACC regulates APS’
retail electric rates and the FERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission
services. While approved electric rates are intended to permit APS to recover its costs of service
and earn a reasonable rate of return, the profitability of APS is affected by the rates it may
charge. Consequently, our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the
satisfactory resolution of any APS retail rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come
before the ACC and the FERC. In connection with its recent rate case settlement agreement, APS
agreed not to request its next general retail rate increase to be effective prior to July 1, 2012.
The ACC must also approve APS’ issuance of securities and any transfer of APS property used to
provide retail electric service, and must approve or receive prior notification of certain
transactions between us, APS and our respective affiliates. Decisions made by the ACC and the FERC
could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.

APS’ ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon
compliance with federal, state or local statutes and regulations, and obtaining and maintaining
certain regulatory permits, approvals and certificates.

APS must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes, regulations, rules, tariffs, and
orders of agencies that regulate APS’ business, including the FERC, the NRC, the EPA and state and
local governmental agencies. These agencies regulate many aspects of APS’ utility operations,
including safety and performance, emissions, siting and construction of facilities, customer
service and the rates that APS can charge retail and wholesale customers. Failure to comply can
subject APS to, among other things, fines and penalties. For example, under the Energy Policy Act
of 2005, the FERC can impose penalties (up to one million dollars per day per violation) for
failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards. APS underwent its first mandatory
regularly-scheduled triennial audit for compliance with these standards in early 2010 and expects
to receive its results by mid-2010. In addition, APS is required to have numerous permits,
approvals and certificates from these agencies. APS believes the necessary permits, approvals and
certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that APS’ business is conducted in
accordance with applicable laws in all material respects. However, changes in regulations or the
imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of
operations. We are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from
pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies

.



The operation of APS’ nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and
potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related
requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of noncompliance,
the NRC has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased
inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut down of a unit, or both, depending upon
the NRC’s assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. APS was
subject to this heightened scrutiny until March 2009, when it exited the NRC’s enhanced inspection
regime. The increased costs resulting from penalties, a heightened level of scrutiny and
implementation of plans to achieve compliance with NRC requirements, may adversely affect APS’
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

APS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, and changes in, or liabilities
under, existing or new laws or regulations may increase APS’ cost of operations or impact its
business plans.

APS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its
present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid
waste, hazardous waste, and coal combustion products, which consist of bottom ash, fly ash and air
pollution control wastes. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating,
and other costs, particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions
obligations. These laws and regulations generally require APS to obtain and comply with a wide
variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals. If there is a delay or failure to
obtain any required environmental regulatory approval, or if APS fails to obtain, maintain or
comply with any such approval, operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to
additional expenses. In addition, failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and
regulations could result in civil liability or criminal penalties. Both public officials and
private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations. APS cannot
predict the outcome (financial or operational) of any related litigation that may arise.

Environmental Clean Up.

APS has been named as a PRP for a Superfund site in Phoenix, Arizona
and it could be named a PRP in the future for other environmental clean up at sites identified by a
regulatory body. APS cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future
expenditures related to environmental matters because of the
difficulty of estimating clean up
costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose
joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties.

Regional Haze.

APS is currently awaiting final rulemaking from the EPA that could impose new
requirements on Four Corners and the Navajo Plant. APS is also awaiting final rulemaking from ADEQ
that could impose new requirements on Cholla. The EPA and ADEQ will require these plants to
install pollution control equipment that constitutes the best available retrofit technology to
lessen the impacts of emissions on visibility surrounding the plants. Depending upon the agencies’
final determinations of what constitutes BART for these plants, the financial impact of installing
the required pollution control equipment could jeopardize the economic viability of the plants or
the ability of individual participants to continue their participation
in these plants.



Coal Ash.

Recently Congress directed the EPA to propose new federal regulations governing the
disposal of CCBs, which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of, among other
things, fly ash and bottom ash. APS currently disposes of CCBs in ash ponds and dry storage
areas at Four Corners and Cholla, and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a
constituent in concrete products. If the EPA regulates CCBs as a hazardous solid waste or phases
out APS’ ability to dispose of CCBs through the use of ash ponds, APS could incur significant costs
for CCB disposal and may be unable to continue its sale of fly ash for beneficial reuse.

New Source Review.

The EPA has taken the position that many projects electric utilities have
performed are major modifications that trigger NSR requirements under the Clean Air Act. The
utilities generally have taken the position that these projects are routine maintenance and did not
result in emissions increases, and thus are not subject to NSR. APS received and responded to a
request from the EPA regarding projects and operations of Four Corners. If the EPA seeks to impose
NSR requirements at Four Corners or any other APS plant, either through a lawsuit or a Notice of
Violation, significant capital investments could be required to install new pollution control
technologies. The EPA could also seek civil penalties.

Mercury and other Hazardous Air Pollutants.

The EPA is required to adopt maximum achievable
control technology emissions standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants by November
2011. Depending on the compliance requirements contained in the final rule, APS may need to make
significant capital investments to install additional pollution control equipment to meet these new
standards.

APS cannot be sure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new
regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it.
Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating
restrictions, particularly if those costs incurred by APS are not fully recoverable from APS’
customers, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations
or cash flows.

APS faces physical and operational risks related to climate change, and potential financial risks
resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse
gas emissions.

Concern over climate change, deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit
CO


, which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel, and other greenhouse
gas emissions. In addition, lawsuits have been filed against companies that emit greenhouse gases,
including a lawsuit filed by the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina, Alaska
against us and several other utilities seeking damages related to climate change, which was
dismissed but has been appealed.

Physical and Operational Risks.

Projections for the Southwest United States from climate
change models include an increase in the number of extreme hot days in the summer, less
precipitation in the form of snow and the earlier runoff of snowmelt, increased wildfire potential,
and the potential for water shortages. Assuming that the primary physical and operational risks to
APS from climate change are increased potential for drought or water shortage, and a mild to
moderate increase in ambient temperatures, APS believes it is taking the appropriate steps at this
time to respond to these risks. Weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations
are common occurrences in the Southwest’s desert area, and these are risk factors that APS
considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric
system. Large increases in ambient temperature due to climate change could require evaluation of
certain materials used within its system and represents a greater challenge.



Financial Risks — Potential Legislation and Regulation

. In the past several years, the United
States Congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions. The
House of Representatives approved a bill that would establish a greenhouse gas emission
cap-and-trade system, and the Senate is currently considering proposed legislation. There is
growing consensus that some form of regulation or legislation is likely to occur in the near future
at the federal level with respect to greenhouse gas emissions.

If the United States Congress, or individual states or groups of states in which APS operates,
ultimately pass legislation regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases, any resulting limitations
on generation facility CO


and other greenhouse gas emissions could result in the
creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes,
emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades and could have a material adverse impact on all
fossil fuel fired generation facilities (particularly coal-fired facilities, which constitute
approximately 28% of APS’ generation capacity). A cap-and-trade program may also result in
counterparty credit risk and financial liquidity risk since collateral is typically exchanged
between counterparties as a means of mitigating risk in the event of a counterparty default.

At the state level, the California legislature enacted legislation to address greenhouse gas
emissions. This legislation and other state-specific initiatives may affect APS’ business,
including sales into the impacted states or the ability of its out-of-state power plant
participants to continue their participation in certain coal-fired power
plants, including Four Corners following expiration of the current lease term in 2016.

In addition, the EPA recently determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health
and welfare. This determination was made in response to a 2007 United States Supreme Court ruling
that greenhouse gases fit within the Clean Air Act’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and, as a
result, the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under
the Clean Air Act. The recent endangerment finding could result in the EPA issuing new regulatory
requirements under the Clean Air Act, beyond those related to motor vehicle emissions, which could
impact APS’ power plants and result in substantial additional costs. Excessive costs to comply
with future legislation or regulations could force APS and other similarly-situated electric power
generators to retire or suspend operations at certain coal-fired facilities.

If APS cannot meet or maintain the level of renewable energy required under Arizona’s increasing
Renewable Energy Standards or the higher commitment levels established in the settlement agreement,
APS may be subject to penalties or fines for non-compliance.

The Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff (“RES”) requires APS to supply an increasing
percentage of renewable energy each year, so that the amount of retail electricity sales from
eligible renewable resources is at least 2.5% of total retail sales by 2010. This amount increases
annually to 15% by 2025. In its recent retail rate case settlement agreement, APS agreed to exceed
these standards and committed to an interim renewable energy target of 10% by year end 2015. A
portion of this total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of
distributed energy resources (generally, small scale renewable technologies located on customers’
properties). The distributed energy requirement is 20% of the overall RES requirement of 2.5% in
2010 and increases to 30% of the applicable RES requirement in 2012 and subsequent years. If APS
fails to implement any of its annual ACC-approved renewable resource plans, it may be subject to
penalties imposed by the ACC, including APS’ inability to recover certain costs. Compliance with
the distributed resource requirement is contingent upon customer participation. The development of
any renewable generation
facilities resulting from the RES is subject to many other risks, including risks relating to
financing, permitting, technology, fuel supply, and the construction of sufficient transmission
capacity to support these facilities.



Deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition, which
could have a significant adverse impact on APS’ business and its results of operations.

In 1999, the ACC approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in
Arizona. Retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on APS due to an
impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of
capital. Although some very limited retail competition existed in APS’ service area in 1999 and
2000, there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility
services to APS’ customers. As a result, APS cannot predict if, when, and the extent to which,
additional competitors may re-enter APS’ service territory.

Currently, there are two matters pending with the ACC that involve a business model where
customers pay solar vendors for the installation and operation of solar facilities based on the
amount of energy produced. The ACC must make a determination whether these entities would be
considered “public service corporations” under the Arizona Constitution, causing them to be
regulated by the ACC. Use of such products by customers within APS’ territory would result in some
level of competition.

As a result of changes in federal law and regulatory policy, competition in the wholesale
electricity market has greatly increased due to a greater participation by traditional electricity
suppliers, non-utility generators, independent power producers, and wholesale power marketers and
brokers. This increased competition could affect APS’ load forecasts, plans for power supply and
wholesale energy sales and related revenues. As a result of the changing regulatory environment
and the relatively low barriers to entry, we expect wholesale competition to increase, which could
adversely affect our business.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

APS’ results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for
electricity.

Weather Conditions.

Weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and
affect the price of energy commodities. Electric power demand is generally a seasonal business.
In Arizona, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at
that time. As a result, APS’ overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal
basis. In addition, APS has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income,
when weather conditions are milder. As a result, unusually mild weather could diminish APS’
results of operations and harm its financial condition.

Higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack, which might result in lowered soil moisture and
an increased threat of forest fires. Forest fires could threaten APS’ communities and electric
transmission lines. Any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact APS’
results of operations.



Effects of Energy Conservation Measures and Distributed Energy.

The ACC has initiated a
rulemaking regarding energy efficiency, which includes a proposed 22% annual energy savings
requirement by 2020. If adopted, this will likely increase participation by APS customers in
energy efficiency and conservation programs and demand-side management efforts, which in turn would
impact the demand for electricity. The proposed rules also include a requirement for the ACC to
review and address financial disincentives, recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost
income/revenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements.
The retail rate case settlement agreement establishes energy efficiency goals for APS that begin in
2010, subjecting APS to energy efficiency requirements in advance of the proposed rules described
above.

APS must also meet certain distributed energy requirements. A portion of APS’ total renewable
energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources
(generally, small scale renewable technologies located on customers’ properties). The distributed
energy requirement is 20% of the overall RES requirement of 2.5% in 2010 and increases to 30% of
the applicable RES requirement in 2012 and subsequent years. Customer participation in distributed
energy programs would result in lower demand, since customers would be meeting some or all of their
own energy needs. Reduced demand due to these energy efficiency and distributed energy
requirements, unless offset through regulatory mechanisms, could have a material adverse impact on
APS’ financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The operation of power generation facilities involves risks that could result in unscheduled power
outages or reduced output, which could materially affect APS’ results of operations

.

The operation of power generation facilities involves certain risks, including the risk of
breakdown or failure of equipment, fuel interruption, and performance below expected levels of
output or efficiency. Unscheduled outages, including extensions of scheduled outages due to
mechanical failures or other complications, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of
APS’ business. If APS’ facilities operate below expectations, especially during its peak seasons,
it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses, including increased purchased power expenses.

The lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on APS’
business and results of operations.

Assured supplies of water are important for APS’ generating plants. Water in the southwestern
United States is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to
access and use such limited supply of water. Both groundwater and surface water in areas important
to APS’ generating plants have been the subject of inquiries, claims and legal proceedings. In
addition, the Four Corners region, in which Four Corners is located, has been experiencing drought
conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in
the watershed that supplies the area. APS’ inability to access sufficient supplies of water could
have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

The ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on Indian lands could
result in uncertainty related to continued easements and rights-of-way, which could have a
significant impact on our business.

Certain APS power plants, including Four Corners, and portions of the transmission lines that
carry power from these plants are located on Indian lands pursuant to easements or other
rights-of-way
that are effective for specified periods. APS is currently unable to predict the outcome of
discussions with the appropriate Indian tribes with respect to future renewal of these easements
and rights-of-way.



There are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities, such as
environmental, health, fuel supply, spent fuel disposal, regulatory and financial risks and the
risk of terrorist attack.

APS has an ownership interest in and operates, on behalf of a group of owners, Palo Verde,
which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the United States. Palo Verde is
subject to environmental, health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate
supplies of nuclear fuel; the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel; the ability to maintain
adequate reserves for decommissioning; potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these
facilities; the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks; and
unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems. APS maintains nuclear decommissioning
trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these
risks; however, it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. In
addition, APS may be required under federal law to pay up to $103 million (but not more than $15
million per year) of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at Palo
Verde, but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. Although we have no reason to
anticipate a serious nuclear incident at Palo Verde, if an incident did occur, it could materially
and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A major incident at a
nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or
licensing of any domestic nuclear unit.

The operation of Palo Verde requires licenses that need to be periodically renewed and/or
extended. In December 2008, APS applied for renewed operating licenses for all three Palo Verde
units for 20 years beyond the expirations of the current licenses. APS does not anticipate any
problems renewing these licenses. However, as a result of potential terrorist threats and
increased public scrutiny of utilities, the licensing process could result in increased licensing
or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible to predict.

The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial
losses that negatively impact our results of operations.

APS’ operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices. APS is exposed to
the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity, natural gas
and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist. We have established procedures to manage
risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives,
including exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options, and swaps.
As part of our overall risk management program, we enter into derivative transactions to hedge
purchases and sales of electricity and fuels. The changes in market value of such contracts have a
high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity. To the extent that commodity markets
are illiquid, we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies, which could result in
greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that
negatively impact our results of operations.

Congress is considering legislation to impose restrictions on the use of over-the-counter
derivatives, including energy derivatives, which could subject APS to governmental regulation
relating to these hedging transactions. If such legislation becomes law, APS could potentially
face higher costs to hedge its risks, fewer potential counterparties
still active in the newly-regulated marketplace and increased liquidity requirements.



We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties. We
use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties.
Despite the fact that the majority of trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the
rating agencies, there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default,
which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period.

Changes in technology may adversely affect APS’ business.

Research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce
power, including fuel cells, micro turbines, clean coal and coal gasification, photovoltaic (solar)
cells and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment, such as more efficient gas
turbines. Advances in these, or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production,
making APS’ generating facilities less competitive. In addition, advances in technology could
reduce the demand for power supply, which could adversely affect APS’ business.

APS is pursuing and implementing advanced technologies, including smart grid transmission and
distribution systems and advanced meters for use in customers’ homes and businesses. Many of the
products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies have not yet been
widely used or tested, and their use on large-scale systems is not as advanced and established as
APS’ existing technologies and equipment. Uncertainties and unknowns related to these and other
advancements in technology and equipment could adversely affect APS’ business if national standards
develop that do not embrace the current technologies or if the technologies and equipment fail to
perform as expected.

FINANCIAL RISKS

Financial market disruptions may increase our financing costs or limit our access to the credit
markets, which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial
strategy.

We rely on access to short-term money markets, longer-term capital markets and the bank
markets as a significant source of liquidity and for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash
flow from our operations. We believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial
markets. However, certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely
affect our ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include:

•

continuation of the current economic downturn;

•

terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of unrelated
energy companies;

•

mergers among financial institutions and the overall health of the banking industry;
or

•

the overall health of the utility industry.

In addition, the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be
satisfied for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting
our lenders, which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources.



Changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates, which would increase our
interest expense on our debt and reduce funds available to us for our current plans. Additionally,
an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by:

•

increasing the cost of future debt financing;

•

reducing our credit ratings;

•

increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; and

•

requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to
payments on our debt, which would reduce funds available to us for operations, future
business opportunities or other purposes.

A reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our current ratings are set forth in “Pinnacle West Consolidated — Liquidity and Capital
Resources — Credit Ratings” in Item 7. We cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will
remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Any
downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West’s and APS’
securities, limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs, which would diminish our
financial results. We would be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and
our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. In addition, borrowing costs
under certain of our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings. A downgrade would
also require us to provide substantial additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash
or other collateral to various counterparties. If our short-term ratings were to be lowered, it
could completely eliminate any possible future access to the commercial paper market. We note that
the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and
that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Market performance, changing interest rates and other economic factors could decrease the value of
our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds and increase our related
obligations, resulting in significant additional funding that could negatively impact our business.

Disruptions in the capital markets may adversely affect the values of fixed income and equity
investments held in our employee benefit plan trusts and nuclear decommissioning trusts. We have
significant obligations in these areas and hold substantial assets in these trusts. A decline in
the market value of these trusts may increase our funding requirements. Additionally, the pension
plan and other postretirement benefit liabilities are impacted by the discount rate, which is the
interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
Declining interest rates impact the discount rate, and may result in increases in pension and other
postretirement benefit costs, cash contributions, regulatory assets, and charges to other
comprehensive income. Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or
changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of the
obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. A significant portion
of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning
costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices. Our inability to fully recover these costs in
a timely manner or any increased funding obligations could negatively impact our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.



We may be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The ultimate
adoption of such standards could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

IFRS is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the International
Accounting Standards Board that is being considered by the SEC to replace accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for use in preparation of financial
statements. If the SEC requires mandatory adoption of IFRS, we may lose our ability to use
regulatory accounting treatment, and would follow IFRS rather than GAAP for the preparation of our
financial statements beginning in 2014. The implementation and adoption of these new standards and
the inability to use regulatory accounting could negatively impact our business, financial
condition or results of operations.

Our cash flow largely depends on the performance of our subsidiaries.

We conduct our operations primarily through subsidiaries. Substantially all of our
consolidated assets are held by such subsidiaries. Accordingly, our cash flow is dependent upon
the earnings and cash flows of these subsidiaries and their distributions to us. The subsidiaries
are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to make distributions to us.

The debt agreements of some of our subsidiaries may restrict their ability to pay dividends,
make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us. An ACC financing order requires APS to
maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40% and does not allow APS to pay common dividends if
the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold. The common equity ratio, as
defined in the ACC order, is common equity divided by the sum of common equity and long-term debt,
including current maturities of long-term debt.

Our ability to meet our debt service obligations could be adversely affected because our debt
securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of our
subsidiaries.

Because we are structured as a holding company, all existing and future debt and other
liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt
securities. None of the indentures under which we or our subsidiaries may issue debt securities
limits our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt in the future. The
assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available, in the first instance, to service
their own debt and other obligations. Our ability to have the benefit of their assets and cash
flows, particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries,
would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their
creditors have been satisfied.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response
to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control:

•

variations in our quarterly operating results;

•

operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts
and investors;



•

changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial
estimates by securities analysts and investors;

•

developments generally affecting industries in which we operate, particularly the
energy distribution and energy generation industries;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint
marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;

•

announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;

•

favorable or adverse regulatory or legislative developments;

•

our dividend policy;

•

future sales by the Company of equity or equity-linked securities; and

•

general domestic and international economic conditions.

In addition, the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been
unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations
may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of Arizona law make it difficult
for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts.

These provisions, which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control
premium, include the following:

•

restrictions on our ability to engage in a wide range of “business combination”
transactions with an “interested shareholder” (generally, any person who owns 10% or
more of our outstanding voting power or any of our affiliates or associates) or any
affiliate or associate of an interested shareholder, unless specific conditions are
met;

•

anti-greenmail provisions of Arizona law and our bylaws that prohibit us from
purchasing shares of our voting stock from beneficial owners of more than 5% of our
outstanding shares unless specified conditions are satisfied;

•

the ability of the Board of Directors to increase the size of the Board and fill
vacancies on the Board, whether resulting from such increase, or from death,
resignation, disqualification or otherwise; and

•

the ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional shares of common stock and
 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and, with respect to preferred
stock, the other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares
without shareholder approval.

While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us
to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable the Board to hinder or frustrate a
transaction that some, or a majority, of our shareholders might believe to be in their best
interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent
directors.



SunCor’s
business and financial results would be adversely affected if it is unable to extend,
modify or renew its credit facilities or repay its debt through sales of its remaining assets.

At December 31, 2009,
SunCor had borrowings of approximately $57 million under its principal loan facility (the "Secured Revolver").
The Secured Revolver matured on January 30, 2010 and SunCor and the agent bank for the Secured Revolver are
discussing an extension of the maturity date to allow time for SunCor to continue discussions
concerning the potential sale of additional properties.
In addition to the Secured Revolver, at December 31, 2009, SunCor had approximately $43 million of
outstanding debt under other credit facilities ($9 million of which has matured since December 31, 2009 and remains outstanding).

If SunCor is unable to obtain an extension or renewal of the
Secured Revolver or its other matured debt, or if it is unable to comply with the mandatory repayment and other provisions of any new or modified
credit agreements, SunCor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of its credit facilities as a result of cross-default provisions.
Such an immediate repayment obligation would have a material adverse impact on SunCor's business and financial position and impair its ongoing viability.

SunCor intends to apply the proceeds of its planned asset sales to the repayment of its
outstanding debt.  If it is unable to locate suitable buyers and close certain asset sales or obtain sufficient proceeds from these sales to maintain or pay off its
existing debt, it may be unable to satisfy obligations under its credit facilities, resulting in the immediate repayment obligations described above.

SunCor cannot predict the outcome of
negotiations with its lenders or its ability to sell assets for sufficient proceeds to repay its outstanding debt.
SunCor's ability to generate sufficient cash from operations while it pursues lender negotiations and further asset sales is uncertain.

The Company has not guaranteed any
SunCor indebtedness.  As a result, we do not believe that SunCor's inability to meet its financial covenants
under the Secured Revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on
Pinnacle West's cash flows or liquidity.  Any resulting SunCor losses would be reflected in Pinnacle West's consolidated financial
statements.  If SunCor were required to seek protection under federal bankruptcy laws, Pinnacle West could be exposed to the uncertainties
and complexities inherent for parent companies in such proceedings.

During 2008 and 2009 the real estate market weakened
significantly resulting in lower land and home sales and depressed real estate prices.  As a result, in 2008 and 2009 SunCor
recognized certain impairment charges.  SunCor may be required to record additional impairments.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

Neither Pinnacle West nor APS has received written comments regarding its periodic or current
reports from the SEC staff that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2009 fiscal
year and that remain unresolved

Transmission and Distribution Facilities

Current Facilities

. APS’ transmission facilities consist of approximately 5,946 pole miles of
overhead lines and approximately 49 miles of underground lines, 5,723 miles of which are located in
Arizona. APS’ distribution facilities consist of approximately 11,362 miles of overhead lines and
approximately 17,308 miles of underground primary cable, all of which are located in Arizona. APS
shares ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies. The following table
shows APS’ jointly-owned interests in those transmission facilities recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009:

Expansion.

Each year APS prepares and files with the ACC a ten-year transmission plan. In
APS’ 2010 plan, APS projects it will invest approximately
$520 million in new transmission over the next ten years, which
includes 270 miles of new lines. This investment will increase the import capability into
metropolitan Phoenix by approximately 26% and will increase the import capability into the Yuma
area by approximately 38%. One significant project presently under construction is the Morgan -
Pinnacle Peak project, which consists of 26 miles of 500kV and 230kV lines. APS completed two
major substation projects in 2009. The Dugas substation (500/69kV) will provide system voltage
support and capacity for the Verde Valley area and the Sugarloaf substation (500/69kV) will provide
system voltage support and capacity for the Show Low and Snowflake areas, and will also support
renewable energy development in that area.

APS continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support
renewable energy facilities. Two such projects, which are included in APS’ 2010 transmission plan,
are the Delany to Palo Verde line and the North Gila to Palo Verde line, both of which are intended
to support the transmission of renewable energy to Phoenix and California.



Plant and Transmission Line Leases and Easements on Indian Lands

The Navajo Plant and Four Corners are located on land held under leases from the Navajo Nation
and also under easements from the federal government. The easement and lease for the Navajo Plant
expire in 2019 and the easement and lease for Four Corners expire in 2016. Each of the leases
contains an option to extend for an additional 25-year period from the end of the existing lease
term, for a rental amount tied to the original rent payment adjusted based on an index. The
easements do not contain an express renewal option and it is unclear what conditions to renewal or
extension of the easements may be imposed. The ultimate cost of renewal of the Navajo Plant and
Four Corners leases and easements is uncertain. The coal contracted for use in these plants is
also located on Indian reservations.

Certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants
are located on Indian lands pursuant to easements or other rights-of-way that are effective for
specified periods. Some of these rights-of-way have expired and our renewal applications have not
yet been acted upon by the appropriate Indian tribes. Other rights expire at various times in the
future and renewal action by the applicable tribe will be required at that time. The majority of
our transmission lines residing on Indian lands are on the Navajo Nation. The Four Corners and
Navajo Plant leases provide Navajo Nation consent to certain of the rights-of-way for transmission
lines related to those plants at a specified rental rate for the original term of the rights-of-way
and for a like payment in any renewal period. In addition, a 1985 amendment to the leases provides
a formula for calculating payments for certain new and renewal rights-of-way. However, some of our
rights-of-way are not covered by the leases, or are granted by other Indian tribes. In recent
negotiations with other utilities or companies for renewal of similar rights-of-way, certain of the
affected Indian tribes have required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid
in the past for such rights-of-way or that are typical for similar permits across non-Indian lands;
however, we are unaware of the underlying agreements and/or specific circumstances surrounding
these renewals. The ultimate cost of renewal of the rights-of-way for our transmission lines is
uncertain. We are monitoring these rights-of-way and easement issues and have initiated
discussions with the Navajo Nation regarding them. We are currently unable to predict the outcome
of this matter.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Pinnacle West’s Consolidated
Financial Statements and APS’ Financial Statements and the related Notes that appear in Item 8 of
this report. For information on the broad factors that may cause our actual future results to
differ from those we currently seek or anticipate, see “Forward-Looking Statements” at the front of
this report and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.

OVERVIEW

Pinnacle West owns all of the outstanding common stock of APS. APS is a vertically-integrated
electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of
Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson
metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona. APS accounts for substantially all of
our revenues and earnings, and is expected to continue to do so.

Areas of Business Focus

Operational Performance and Reliability.

Nuclear.

Palo Verde experienced strong performance during 2009, with its three units
achieving a combined year-end capacity factor of 89%. With a focus on safely and efficiently
generating electricity for the long-term, APS applied for twenty-year renewals of its operating
licenses for each of the three Palo Verde units, and is making preparations to secure necessary
resources to operate the plant during this extended period of time. Palo Verde’s 2009
accomplishments also included the installation of a new reactor vessel head, upgraded equipment and
processes designed to substantially reduce the time required to defuel and refuel the reactor
during refueling outages, and the successful implementation of a comprehensive improvement plan,
which allowed Palo Verde Unit 3 to exit the NRC’s enhanced inspection regime (“Column 4”) earlier
than anticipated, in March of 2009.

Coal and Related Environmental Matters.

APS’ coal plants, Four Corners and Cholla, achieved
net capacity factors of 88% and 77%, respectively, in 2009. APS is focused on developing
legislation and increased regulation concerning greenhouse gas emissions, and the potential impacts
on our coal fleet. Recent concern over climate change and other emission-related issues could have
a significant impact on our capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes,
emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades for these plants. APS is closely monitoring
our long range capital management plans, understanding that the resulting legislation and
regulation could impact the economic viability of certain plants, as well as the willingness or
ability of power plant participants to fund any such equipment upgrades. See “Business of Arizona
Public Service Company — Environmental Matters — Climate Change” in Item 1 and climate
change-related risks described in Item 1A for additional climate change developments and risks
facing APS.



Transmission and Delivery.

In the area of transmission and delivery to its customers, APS
also ranked favorably during 2009, with top quartile performance for average customer outage time.
During 2009, APS undertook several significant transmission projects, including the Morgan to
Pinnacle Peak transmission line scheduled for completion at the end of 2010, and the completion of
two switchyards, one of which will support capacity for renewable energy projects. APS is working
closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs resulting from the current
focus on renewable energy. APS is also working to establish and expand smart grid technology
throughout its service territory designed to provide a variety of benefits both to APS and its
customers. This technology should allow customers to better monitor their energy use and needs,
minimize system outage durations and the number of customers that experience outages, and
facilitate cost savings to APS through improved reliability and the automation of certain
distribution functions, including remote meter reading and remote connects and disconnects.

Renewable
Energy.

APS is committed to increasing the amount of energy produced by renewable
energy resources, which was a significant focus in APS’ recent rate case settlement described
below. APS and the other parties to the rate case worked with the ACC Commissioners to address a
wide range of customer needs and to secure a clean, sustainable energy future for Arizona.
The ACC adopted a renewable energy standard several years ago, recognizing the importance of
renewable energy to our state. In the rate case settlement agreement, APS agreed to exceed these
standards, committing that 10% of APS’ resources will come from renewable energy by the year 2015.
A variety of other provisions in the settlement agreement reinforce APS’ dedication to renewable
energy through initiatives to build a photovoltaic solar plant, install solar rooftop panels on
schools and seek an Arizona wind generation project.

During 2009, APS filed its annual RES implementation plan that included a request for ACC
approval of the “AZ Sun Program.” As proposed in its plan,
APS would invest an estimated $500 million to develop at least 100 MW of photovoltaic solar plants. It currently anticipates that this solar
capacity would be placed into service in the 2011 to 2014 timeframe. The ultimate timing depends
on the outcome of current and future procurement processes. See Note 3 for additional details
regarding this program, including the estimated timing of the ACC’s determination on the matter and
the related cost recovery. APS also issued two requests for proposal (“RFP”) for renewable
resources in early 2010. These RFP’s are part of the process for procuring the additional
renewable resources required under the rate case settlement. The first RFP is for utility-scale
solar photovoltaic projects between 15 and 50 MW. Assuming ACC approval of the AZ Sun Program as
proposed, this RFP will serve as the first procurement step for implementing that program. The
second RFP is for wind projects between 15 and 100 MW to be located within Arizona.

Rate Matters.

APS needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating
expenditures to maintain adequate financial health. APS’ retail rates are regulated by the ACC and
its wholesale electric rates (primarily for transmission) are regulated by the FERC. At the end of
2009, the ACC approved a settlement agreement entered into by APS and twenty-one of the
twenty-three other parties to APS’ general retail rate case, with modifications that did not
materially affect the overall economic terms of the agreement. The rate case settlement should
strengthen APS’ financial condition by allowing for rate stability and a greater level of cost
recovery and return on investment. It also authorizes and requires equity infusions into APS of at
least $700 million prior to the end of 2014. The settlement demonstrates cooperation among APS,
the ACC staff, the Residential Utility Consumer Office (RUCO) and other intervenors to the rate
case, and establishes a future rate case filing plan that allows APS the opportunity to help shape
Arizona’s energy future outside of continual rate cases. See Note 3 for a detailed discussion of
the settlement agreement terms and information on APS’ FERC rates.

APS has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to APS of its
fuel and transmission costs, and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its
energy
efficiency, demand-side management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs. These
mechanisms are described more fully in Note 3.



Financial Strength and Flexibility.

Despite the volatility and disruption of the credit
markets, Pinnacle West and APS currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective
credit facilities and have been able to access these facilities, ensuring adequate liquidity for
each company. In early February 2010, APS entered into a $500 million revolving credit facility,
replacing its $377 million revolving credit facility that would have otherwise terminated in
December 2010. At that same time, Pinnacle West entered into a $200 million revolving credit
facility that replaces its $283 million facility that also would have otherwise terminated in
December 2010.

SunCor Real Estate Operations.

As a result of the continuing distressed conditions in the
real estate markets, during 2009 SunCor undertook a program to dispose of its homebuilding
operations, master-planned communities, land parcels, commercial assets and golf courses in order
to eliminate its outstanding debt. This resulted in impairment charges of approximately $266
million, or $161 million after income taxes, for 2009. See “Pinnacle West Consolidated — Liquidity
and Capital Resources — Other Subsidiaries — SunCor” below for a discussion of SunCor’s outstanding
debt and related matters, Note 23 for a further discussion of impairment charges and the
SunCor-related risk factor in Item 1A.

Subsidiaries.

Our other first tier subsidiaries, El Dorado and APSES, are not expected to
have any material impact on our financial results, or to require any material amounts of capital,
over the next three years.

Key Financial Drivers

In addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above, many factors influence
our financial results and our future financial outlook, including those listed below. We closely
monitor these factors to plan for the Company’s current needs, and to adjust our expectations,
financial budgets and forecasts appropriately.

Electric Operating Revenues.

For the years 2007 through 2009, retail electric revenues
comprised approximately 94% of our total electric operating revenues. Our electric operating
revenues are affected by customer growth, variations in weather from period to period, customer
mix, average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs, electricity rates
and tariffs, the recovery of PSA deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms.
Off-system sales of excess generation output, purchased power and natural gas are included in
regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are
credited to APS’ retail customers through the PSA. These revenue transactions are affected by the
availability of excess economic generation or other energy resources and wholesale market
conditions, including competition, demand and prices.

Customer and Sales Growth.

Customer growth in APS’ service territory for the year ended
December 31, 2009 was 0.6% compared with the prior year. For the three years 2007 through 2009,
APS’ customer growth averaged 1.8% per year. We currently expect customer growth to average about
1% per year for 2010 through 2012 due to economic conditions both nationally and in Arizona.
Retail sales in kilowatt-hours, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, for 2009
declined 2.4% compared to the prior year, reflecting the poor economic conditions in 2009 and the
effects of our energy efficiency programs. For the three years 2007 through 2009, APS’ actual
retail electricity sales in kilowatt-hours, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations,
grew at an average annual rate
of 0.3%. We currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatt-hours will
remain flat on average per year during 2010 through 2012, including the effects of APS’ energy
efficiency programs, but excluding the effects of weather variations. A continuation of the
economic downturn, or the failure of the Arizona economy to rebound in the near future, could
further impact these estimates. The customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph apply
to Native Load customers.



Actual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from our projections as
a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, usage patterns, impacts
of energy efficiency programs and responses to retail price changes. Our experience indicates that
a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatt-hour sales projection attributable to such economic
factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income
of up to $10 million.

Weather.

In forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above, we assume normal
weather patterns based on historical data. Historical extreme weather variations have resulted in
annual variations in net income in excess of $20 million. However, our experience indicates that
the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net
income of up to $10 million.

Fuel and Purchased Power Costs.

Fuel and purchased power costs included on our Consolidated
Statements of Income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes, existing contracts for
purchased power and generation fuel, our power plant performance, transmission availability or
constraints, prevailing market prices, new generating plants being placed in service in our market
areas, our hedging program for managing such costs and PSA deferrals and the amortization thereof.

Operations and Maintenance Expenses

.

Operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by
growth, power plant operations, maintenance of utility plant (including generation, transmission,
and distribution facilities), inflation, outages, higher-trending pension and other postretirement
benefit costs, renewable energy and demand side management related expenses (which are offset by
the same amount of regulated electricity segment operating revenues) and other factors. In its
recent retail rate case settlement, APS committed to operational expense reductions from 2010
through 2014 and received approval to defer certain pension and other postretirement benefit cost
increases to be incurred in 2011 and 2012.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses.

Depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted
by net additions to utility plant and other property (such as new generation, transmission, and
distribution facilities), and changes in depreciation and amortization rates. The “Capital
Expenditures” section below provides information regarding the planned additions to our facilities.
We have also applied to the NRC for renewed operating licenses for each of the Palo Verde units.
If the NRC grants the extension, we estimate that our annual pretax depreciation expense will
decrease by approximately $34 million at the later of the license extension date or January 1,
2012.

Property Taxes.

Taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes, which are
affected by the value of property in-service and under construction, assessment ratios, and tax
rates. The average property tax rate for APS, which currently owns the majority of our property,
was 7.5% of the assessed value for 2009, 7.8% of the assessed value for 2008 and 8.3% of the
assessed value for 2007. We expect property taxes to increase as we add new utility plant
(including new generation, transmission and distribution facilities described below under “Capital
Additions”) and as we improve our existing facilities.



Income Taxes

.

Income taxes are affected by the amount of pre-tax book income, income tax
rates, and certain non-taxable items, such as the allowance for equity funds used during
construction. In addition, income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with
taxing authorities.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the
interest rates on that debt (see Note 6.) The primary factors affecting borrowing levels are
expected to be our capital expenditures, long-term debt maturities, and internally generated cash
flow. Capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under
construction. We stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial
operation.

PINNACLE WEST CONSOLIDATED — RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our results of operations, provided below, are based upon our two reportable business
segments:

•

our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail
and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electric service to Native Load
customers) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission and
distribution; and

•

our real estate segment, which consists of SunCor’s real estate development and
investment activities.

Operating Results — 2009 Compared with 2008

Our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for 2009 was $68 million,
compared with net income of $242 million for the prior year. The decrease in net income was
primarily due to 2009 real estate impairment charges recorded by SunCor, the Company’s real estate
subsidiary.

In addition, regulated electricity segment net income decreased approximately $13 million from
the prior year primarily due to lower retail sales resulting from lower usage per customer; higher
interest charges, net of capitalized financing costs; higher depreciation and amortization
expenses; and the absence of income tax benefits related to prior years recorded in 2008. These
negative factors were partially offset by increased revenues due to the interim rate increase
effective January 1, 2009 and transmission rate increases.

Operations and maintenance

Operations and maintenance expenses increased $66 million for the
year ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily because of:

•

An increase of $62 million related to renewable energy and demand-side management
programs, which are offset in operating revenues;

•

An increase of $29 million in generation costs, including more planned maintenance,
partially offset by lower costs at Palo Verde due to cost efficiency measures; and

•

A decrease of $25 million associated with cost saving measures and other factors,
including the absence of employee severance costs in 2009.



Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $17 million
for the year ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily because of increases in utility
plant in service. The increases in utility plant in service are the result of various improvements
to APS’ existing fossil and nuclear generating plants and distribution and transmission
infrastructure additions and upgrades.

Interest charges, net of capitalized financing costs

Interest charges, net of capitalized
financing costs increased $28 million for the year ended 2009 compared with the prior year
primarily because of higher debt balances, partially offset by the effects of lower interest rates
(see discussion related to APS’ debt issuances in “Pinnacle West Consolidated — Liquidity and
Capital Resources” below). Interest charges, net of capitalized
financing costs are comprised of the regulated electricity segment portions of
the line items interest expense, capitalized interest and allowance for equity funds used during
construction from the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Other income (expenses), net

Other income (expenses), net improved $19 million for the year
ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily because of improved investment gains. Other
income (expenses), net is comprised of the regulated electricity
segment portions of the line items other income and other expense from the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Income taxes

Income taxes were $50 million higher for the year ended 2009 compared with the
prior year primarily because of $30 million of income tax benefits related to prior years recorded
in 2008 and higher pretax income. See Note 4.

Real estate segment

During the first quarter of 2009, we decided to restructure SunCor through the sale of
substantially all of its assets. The real estate segment net loss attributable to common
shareholders was $141 million higher for the year ended 2009 compared with the prior year primarily
because of:

•

An increase in real estate impairment charges of $213 million (see Note 23 for
details of the impairment charges);

•

A decrease of $20 million in income from other real estate operations primarily due
to 2008 income from a commercial property sale; and

•

An increase in income tax benefits of $92 million primarily because of a higher net
loss.

All Other

All other earnings were $20 million lower for the year ended 2009 compared with the prior year
primarily because of planned reductions of marketing and trading activities and the absence of the
2008 resolution of certain tax issues associated with the sale of Silverhawk in 2005.

Operating Results — 2008 Compared with 2007

Our consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for 2008 was $242 million,
compared with net income of $307 million for the prior year. The decrease in net income was
primarily due to lower results recorded by SunCor, the Company’s real estate subsidiary.



In addition, regulated electricity segment net income decreased approximately $18 million from
the prior year primarily due to higher operations and maintenance expenses; lower retail sales due
to the effects of weather; higher depreciation and amortization expenses; and higher interest
charges, net of capitalized financing costs. These negative factors were partially offset by
increased revenues due to the rate increase effective July 1, 2007; transmission rate increases;
and income tax benefits related to prior years recorded in 2008.

Operations and maintenance

Operations and maintenance expenses increased $87 million for the
year ended 2008 compared with the prior year primarily because of:

•

An increase of $30 million related to customer service and other costs including
distribution system reliability;

•

An increase of $18 million in generation costs, including more planned maintenance;

•

An increase of $14 million related to renewable energy programs, which are offset in
operating revenues;

•

An increase of $9 million associated with employee severance costs in 2008; and

•

An increase of $16 million due to other miscellaneous factors.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $18 million
for the year ended 2008 compared with the prior year primarily because of increases in utility
plant in service. The increases in utility plant in service are the result of various improvements
to APS’ existing fossil and nuclear generating plants and distribution and transmission
infrastructure additions and upgrades.

Interest charges, net of capitalized financing costs

Interest charges, net of capitalized
financing costs increased $15 million for the year ended 2008 compared with the prior year
primarily because of higher rates on certain APS pollution control bonds and higher short-term debt
balances. Interest charges, net of capitalized financing costs, are
comprised   of the regulated     electricity  segment portions of the line items
interest expense, capitalized interest and allowance for equity funds used during construction from
the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Other income (expenses), net

Other income (expenses), net reduced earnings by an additional
$14 million for the year ended 2008 compared with the prior year primarily because of losses on
investments and lower interest income. Other income (expenses), net
is comprised   of the regulated     electricity  segment portions of the line items
other income and other expense from the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Income taxes

Income taxes were $47 million lower for the year ended 2008 compared with the
prior year primarily because of $17 million of increased income tax benefits related to prior years
resolved in 2008 and 2007 and lower pre-tax income. See Note 4.

Real estate segment

The real estate segment net income attributable to common shareholders was $49 million lower
for the year ended 2008 compared with the prior year primarily because of:

•

Real estate impairment charges of $53 million (see Note 23) without comparable
charges in the prior year;

•

A decrease of $27 million from other real estate operations primarily due to
decreased land parcel sales in the 2008 period as a result of the weak real estate
market; and

•

An increase in income tax benefits of $31 million primarily because of the net loss
recorded in 2008.

2009 Compared with 2008

The increase of approximately $217 million in net cash provided by operating activities is
primarily due to a reduction of collateral and margin cash required as a result of changes in
commodity prices and a 2009 income tax refund (see Note 4).

The decrease of approximately $110 million in net cash used for investing activities is
primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures net of contributions (see table and
discussion below), partially offset by lower real estate sales primarily due to a commercial
property sale in 2008.

The increase of approximately $337 million in net cash used for financing activities is
primarily due to repayments of short-term borrowings, partially offset by APS’ issuance of $500
million of unsecured senior notes (see Note 6).

2008 Compared with 2007

The increase of approximately $156 million in net cash provided by operating activities is
primarily due to lower current income taxes; lower real estate investments resulting from the weak
real estate market; and increased retail revenue related to higher Base Fuel Rates, partially
offset by increased collateral and margin cash provided as a result of changes in commodity prices.

The decrease of approximately $58 million in net cash used for investing activities is
primarily due to a real estate commercial property sale in 2008; lower levels of capital
expenditures (see table and discussion below); and increased contributions in aid of construction
related to changes in 2008 in APS’ line extension policy (see Note 3), partially offset by lower
cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases of investment securities.



The decrease of approximately $134 million in net cash provided by financing activities is
primarily due to the use of the proceeds from the sale of a real estate commercial property to pay
down long-term debt in 2008, partially offset by higher levels of short-term debt borrowings.

(a)

Generation includes nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately $60 million to
$80 million per year for 2010, 2011 and 2012.

(b)

Primarily information systems and facilities projects.

(c)

Consists primarily of capital expenditures for residential, land development
and retail and office building construction reflected in “Real estate investments” and
“Capital expenditures” on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to APS’ existing fossil
and nuclear plants. Examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions,
upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines, boilers and
environmental equipment. Environmental expenditures for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 are
approximately $20 million, $80 million and $220 million, respectively. We are also monitoring the
status of certain environmental matters, which, depending on their final outcome, could require
modification to our environmental expenditures. (See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company —
Environmental Matters — EPA Environmental Regulation — Regional Haze Rules and Mercury and other
Hazardous Air Pollutants” in Item 1.)



Distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions
and upgrades, capital replacements, new customer construction and related information systems and
facility costs. Examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power
lines, substations, line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to
customer information systems.

Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and/or external financings,
which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock.

Pinnacle West (Parent Company)

Our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest
payments on our long-term debt. The level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth
will be dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, payout ratio trends, free
cash flow and financial market conditions.

On January 20, 2010, the Pinnacle West Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of
$0.525 per share of common stock, payable on March 1, 2010, to shareholders of record on
February 1, 2010.

Our primary sources of cash are dividends from APS, external debt and equity financings. For
the years 2007 through 2009, total distributions from APS were $510 million and total distributions
received from SunCor were $5 million. For 2009, cash distributions from APS were $170 million and
there were no distributions from SunCor.

An existing ACC order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40%. As
defined in the ACC order, the common equity ratio is common equity divided by the sum of common
equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt. At December 31, 2009,
APS’ common equity ratio, as defined, was 50%. Its total common equity was approximately $3.4
billion, and total capitalization was approximately $6.8 billion. APS would be prohibited from
paying dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below approximately $2.7 billion,
assuming APS’ total capitalization remains the same.

The credit and liquidity markets experienced significant stress beginning the third quarter of
2008. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, Pinnacle West and APS have not accessed the commercial
paper market due to negative market conditions. They have both been able to access existing credit
facilities, ensuring adequate liquidity.

At December 31, 2009, Pinnacle West had a $283 million revolving credit facility that was
scheduled to terminate in December 2010. The revolver was available to support the issuance of up
to $250 million in commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings, including issuances of
letters of credit of up to $94 million. The parent company had $149 million of borrowings
outstanding under its revolving credit facility and no letters of credit at December 31, 2009.

On February 12, 2010, Pinnacle West refinanced its $283 million revolving credit facility that
would have matured in December 2010, and decreased the size of the facility to $200 million. The
new revolving credit facility terminates in February 2013. Pinnacle West may increase the amount
of the facility up to a maximum of $300 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and
with the consent of the lenders. Pinnacle West will use the facility for general corporate
purposes, repayment of long-term debt, and for the issuance of letters of credit. Interest rates
are based on Pinnacle West’s senior unsecured debt credit ratings. In addition, because of the
downsized revolving credit facility, the Company is in the process of reducing the size of its
commercial paper program to $200 million from $250 million.



Pinnacle West expects to recognize approximately $125 million of cash tax benefits related to
SunCor’s strategic asset sales (see Note 23), which will not be realized until the asset sale
transactions are completed. Approximately $105 million of these benefits were recorded in 2009 as
reductions to income tax expense related to the current impairment charges. The additional $20
million of tax benefits were recorded as reductions to income tax expense related to the SunCor
impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.

The $91 million income tax receivable (current and long-term) on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets represents the anticipated cash refunds related to an APS tax accounting method change
approved by the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) in the third quarter of 2009 and the
expected tax benefits related to the SunCor strategic asset sales that closed in 2009.

Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a
non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and
our subsidiaries. IRS regulations require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan.
We contribute at least the minimum amount required under IRS regulations, but no more than the
maximum tax-deductible amount. The minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of
plan assets and our pension obligation. The assets in the plan are comprised of fixed-income,
equity and short-term investments. Future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset
performance and plan actuarial assumptions. We made no contribution to our pension plan in 2009.
We currently estimate that our pension contributions could average around $100 million for several
years, assuming the discount rate remains at approximately current levels. In January 2010, we
made a voluntary contribution of approximately $50 million to our pension plan and we expect to
make an additional voluntary contribution of $50 million later in 2010. The contribution to our
other postretirement benefit plans in 2010 is estimated to be approximately $15 million. APS and
other subsidiaries fund their share of the contributions. APS’ share is approximately 97% of both
plans.

See Note 3 for information regarding the recent retail rate case settlement, which includes
ACC authorization and requires equity infusions into APS of at least $700 million by December 31,
2014. Pinnacle West intends to issue equity to provide most of the funds for the equity infusions
into APS. Such equity issuances may occur at any time in the period through 2014, in Pinnacle
West’s discretion.

In May 2007, Pinnacle West infused approximately $40 million of equity into APS, consisting of
proceeds of stock issuances in 2006 under Pinnacle West’s Investors Advantage Plan (direct stock
purchase and dividend reinvestment plan) and employee stock plans.

APS

APS’ capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and mandatory redemptions
of long-term debt. APS pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations and, to the
extent necessary, equity infusions from Pinnacle West and external financings. See “Pinnacle West
(Parent Company)” above for a discussion of the common equity ratio that APS must maintain in order
to pay dividends to Pinnacle West.

On February 26, 2009, APS issued $500 million of 8.75% unsecured senior notes that mature on
March 1, 2019. Net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay short-term borrowings
under two committed revolving lines of credit incurred to fund capital expenditures and for general
corporate purposes.



During 2009, APS refinanced approximately $343 million of its $656 million pollution control
bonds. As a result of these refinancings, the terms of which are described in detail in Note 6,
APS no longer has any outstanding debt securities in auction rate mode.

On September 11, 2008, APS purchased all of the approximately $27 million of the Coconino
Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, Series 1996A and Series 1999 due December 2031 and April 2034 and
held them as treasury bonds. On September 22, 2009, Coconino issued approximately $27 million of
Coconino Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2009 Series B due April 2038 to redeem the
existing bonds. APS used the funds received from the issuance to repay certain existing
indebtedness under a revolving line of credit drawn upon by APS to fund its purchase of the 1996A
and 1999 Series Bonds in 2008. The 2009 Series B Bonds are payable solely from revenues obtained
from APS pursuant to a loan agreement between APS and Coconino. According to the indenture of the
bonds, the interest rate of the 2009 Series B Bonds could be reset daily, weekly, monthly, or at
other time intervals. The initial rate period selected for the 2009 Series B Bonds is a daily rate
period. At December 31, 2009, the daily interest rate was 0.26%. The daily rates are variable
rates set by a remarketing agent. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2009 Series B Bonds, the
Company entered into a two year letter of credit and reimbursement agreement to provide credit
support for the 2009 Series B Bonds.

At December 31, 2009, APS had two committed revolving credit facilities totaling $866 million,
of which $377 million was scheduled to terminate in December 2010 and $489 million terminates in
September 2011. The revolvers were available either to support the issuance of up to $250 million
in commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings, including issuances of letters of credit up
to $583 million. At December 31, 2009, APS had no borrowings and no letters of credit under its
revolving lines of credit.

On February 12, 2010, APS refinanced its $377 million revolving credit facility that would
have matured in December 2010, and increased the size of the facility to $500 million. The new
revolving credit facility terminates in February 2013. APS may increase the amount of the facility
up to a maximum of $700 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of
the lenders. APS will use the facility for general corporate purposes and for the issuance of
letters of credit. Interest rates are based on APS’ senior unsecured debt credit ratings.

Other Financing Matters —

See Note 3 for information regarding the PSA approved by the ACC.
Although APS defers actual retail fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis, APS’
recovery of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual and, if necessary, periodic PSA
adjustments.

See Note 3 for information regarding the recent retail rate case settlement, which includes
ACC authorization and requires equity infusions into APS of at least $700 million by December 31,
2014.

See Note 18 for information related to the change in our margin accounts.



Other Subsidiaries

SunCor

— SunCor's principal loan facility,
the SunCor Secured Revolver, is secured primarily by an interest in land, commercial properties, land contracts and homes under
construction.  At December 31, 2009, SunCor had borrowings of approximately $57 million under the Secured Revolver (see Note 6).
The revolver matured on January 30, 2010.  SunCor and the agent bank for the Secured Revolver are discussing an extension of the
maturity date to allow time for SunCor to continue discussions concerning the potential sale of additional properties.  In addition
to the Secured Revolver, at December 31, 2009, SunCor had approximately $43 million of outstanding debt under other credit facilities
($9 million of which has matured since December 31, 2009 and remains outstanding) (see Notes 5 and 6).  SunCor intends to apply the
proceeds of planned asset sales (see Note 23) to the repayment of its outstanding debt.

Real estate impairment charges recorded throughout 2009
(see Note 23) resulted in violations of certain covenants contained in the SunCor Secured Revolver and SunCor's other credit facilities.
The lenders have taken no enforcement action related to the covenant defaults.

If SunCor is unable to obtain an extension or renewal
of the Secured Revolver or its other matured debt, or if it is unable to comply with the mandatory repayment and other provisions of
any new or modified credit agreements, SunCor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of its
credit facilities as a result of cross-default provisions.  Such an immediate repayment obligation would have a material adverse
impact on SunCor's business and financial position and impair its ongoing viability.

SunCor cannot predict the outcome of negotiations
with its lenders or its ability to sell assets for sufficient proceeds to repay its outstanding debt.  SunCor's ability to generate
sufficient cash from operations while it pursues lender negotiations and further asset sales is uncertain.

Neither Pinnacle West nor any of its other subsidiaries
has guaranteed any SunCor indebtedness.  A SunCor debt default would not result in a cross-default of any of the debt of Pinnacle
West or any of its other subsidiaries.  While there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of this matter, Pinnacle West
does not believe that SunCor's inability to obtain waivers or similar relief from SunCor's lenders would have a material adverse
impact on Pinnacle West's cash flows or liquidity.

As of December 31, 2009, SunCor could not transfer any
cash dividends to Pinnacle West as a result of the covenants mentioned above.  The restriction does not materially affect Pinnacle
West's ability to meet its ongoing capital requirements.

El Dorado

— El Dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and
intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments.

APSES

— APSES expects minimal capital expenditures over the next three years.

Debt Provisions

Pinnacle West’s and APS’ debt covenants related to their respective bank financing
arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios. Certain of APS’ bank financing arrangements
also include an interest coverage test. Pinnacle West and APS comply with these covenants and each
anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements. For both
Pinnacle West and APS, these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total
consolidated capitalization not exceed 65%. At December 31, 2009, the ratio was approximately 52%
for Pinnacle West and 48% for APS. The provisions regarding interest coverage require minimum cash
coverage of two times the interest requirements for APS. The interest coverage was approximately
4.6 times under APS’ bank financing agreements as of December 31, 2009. Failure to comply with
such covenant levels would result in an event of default which, generally speaking, would require
the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross-default other debt.
See further discussion of “cross-default” provisions below.



Neither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’ financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would
result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating
downgrade. However, our bank financial agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest
costs we pay are determined by our current credit ratings.

All of Pinnacle West’s loan agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in
defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or
APS were to default under certain other material agreements. All of APS’ bank agreements contain
cross-default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment
under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.
Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings.

See Notes 5 and 6 for further discussions of liquidity matters.

Credit Ratings

The ratings of securities of Pinnacle West and APS as of February
17, 2010 are shown below.
The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies, from which an explanation of the
significance of their ratings may be obtained. There is no assurance that these ratings will
continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the
rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Any downward revision
or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West’s or APS’ securities and serve
to increase the cost of and limit access to capital. It may also require substantial additional
cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative instruments, insurance
policies, natural gas transportation, fuel supply, and other energy-related contracts. At this
time, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to cover a downward revision to our credit ratings.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate VIE lessors in order to sell and
lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2. The leases are accounted for as operating leases. We
are not the primary beneficiary of the Palo Verde VIEs and, accordingly, do not consolidate them
(see Note 9).

APS is exposed to losses under the Palo Verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of
certain events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur. Under certain
circumstances (for example, the NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde
or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to assume the debt associated
with the transactions, make specified payments to the equity participants, and take title to the
leased Unit 2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written down in value. If
such an event had occurred as of December 31, 2009, APS would have been required to assume
approximately $152 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately $153 million.

SunCor is the primary beneficiary of certain land development arrangements and, accordingly,
consolidates the variable interest entities. The assets and non-controlling interests reflected in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these arrangements were approximately $29 million at
December 31, 2009 and at December 31, 2008.

See Note 2 for a discussion of amended accounting guidance relating to VIEs adopted on January
1, 2010.

Guarantees and Letters of Credit

We have issued parental guarantees and letters of credit and obtained surety bonds on behalf
of our subsidiaries.

Our parental guarantees for APS relate to commodity energy products. In addition, Pinnacle
West has obtained approximately $8 million of surety bonds related to APS’ operations, which
primarily relate to self-insured workers’ compensation. Our credit support instruments enable
APSES to offer energy-related products. Non-performance or non-payment under the original contract
by our subsidiaries would require us to perform under the guarantee or surety bond. No liability
is currently recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to Pinnacle West’s current
outstanding guarantees on behalf of our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009, we had no guarantees
that were in default. Our guarantees have no recourse or collateral provisions to allow us to
recover amounts paid under the guarantees. We generally agree to indemnification provisions
related to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements, with limited
exceptions depending on the particular agreement. See Note 21 for additional information regarding
guarantees and letters of credit.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management must often make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting
period. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ
from those estimates. We consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical
because of the uncertainties, judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and
operations involved.

Regulatory Accounting

Regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators, such as the ACC and the FERC, to
be reflected in our financial statements. Their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that
would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies.
Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of
future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future
costs that have already been collected from customers. Management continually assesses whether our
regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable
regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same
jurisdiction. This determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in the
state and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable,
the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings. We had $782 million of
regulatory assets and $766 million of regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
December 31, 2009.

Included in the balance of regulatory assets at December 31, 2009 is a regulatory asset of
$532 million for pension and other postretirement benefits. This regulatory asset represents the
future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings. If
these costs are disallowed by the ACC, this regulatory asset would be charged to OCI and result in
lower future earnings.

See Notes 1 and 3 for more information.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting

Changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement
benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position.
The most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and
net periodic cost, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings
on invested funds over the long-term, and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates. We review these
assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.



The following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions
would have had on the December 31, 2009 reported pension liability on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and our 2009 reported pension expense, after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed
to electric plant participants, on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income (dollars in

See Note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.



Derivative Accounting

Derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying
interpretations. Our evaluation of these rules, as they apply to our contracts, determines whether
we use accrual accounting (for contracts designated as normal) or fair value (mark-to-market)
accounting. Mark-to-market accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized
periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met. For cash flow hedges, the effective
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock equity (as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss)) and the ineffective portion is recognized in
current earnings.

See “Market Risks — Commodity Price Risk” below for quantitative analysis. See “Fair Value
Measurements” below for additional information on valuation. See Note 1 for discussion on
accounting policies and Note 18 for a further discussion on derivative accounting.

Fair Value Measurements

We apply recurring fair value measurements to derivative instruments, nuclear decommissioning
trusts, certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We use inputs, or
assumptions that market participants would use, to determine fair market value, and the
significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in the fair value
hierarchy. We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs. The determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and
complex judgment. Our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair
value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within the fair
value hierarchy. Actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value. See Note 14 for
further fair value measurement discussion, Note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and Note 18
for a further discussion on derivative accounting.

Our nuclear decommissioning trusts invest in fixed income securities and equity securities.
The fair values of these securities are based on observable inputs for identical or similar assets.
See Note 12 for further discussion of our nuclear decommissioning trusts.

Real Estate Investment Impairments

We had real estate investments of $120 million and $3 million of home inventory on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009. For purposes of evaluating impairment, in
accordance with guidance on the impairment and disposal of long-lived assets, we classify our real
estate assets, such as land under development, land held for future development, and commercial
property, as “held and used.” When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of real estate assets considered held and used may not be recoverable, we compare the
undiscounted cash flows that we estimate will be generated by each asset to its carrying amount.
If the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, we adjust the asset to fair value and
recognize an impairment charge. The adjusted value becomes the new book value (carrying amount)
for held and used assets. We may have real estate assets classified as held and used with fair
values that are lower than their carrying amounts, but are not deemed to be impaired because the
undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying amounts.



Real estate home inventory is considered to be held for sale for the purposes of evaluating
impairment. Home inventories are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost
to sell. Fair value less cost to sell is evaluated each period to determine if it has changed.
Losses (and gains not to exceed any cumulative loss previously recognized) are reported as
adjustments to the carrying amount.

We determine fair value for our real estate assets primarily based on the future cash flows
that we estimate will be generated by each asset discounted for market risk. Our impairment
assessments and fair value determinations require significant judgment regarding key assumptions
such as future sales prices, future construction and land development costs, future sales timing,
and discount rates. The assumptions are specific to each project and may vary among projects. The
discount rates we used to determine fair values at December 31, 2009 ranged from 11% to 29%. Due
to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process, with regard to impairments, it
is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates. If conditions in the broader
economy or the real estate markets worsen, or as a result of a change in SunCor’s strategy, we may
be required to record additional impairments.

OTHER ACCOUNTING MATTERS

See Note 2 for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards and new standards to be
adopted in the future.

In June 2009, the FASB issued amended guidance on the consolidation of variable interest
entities. The model for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest and is
the primary beneficiary of a VIE has changed significantly under the new guidance. Previously,
variable interest holders had to determine whether they had a controlling financial interest in a
VIE based on a quantitative analysis of the expected gains and/or losses of the entity. The new
guidance requires an enterprise with a variable interest in a VIE to perform a qualitative
assessment in determining whether it has a controlling financial interest in the entity, and if so,
whether it is the primary beneficiary. Furthermore, the amended guidance requires companies to
continually evaluate VIEs for consolidation. This guidance was effective for us on January 1, 2010.
We are continuing to evaluate the impact this new guidance may have on our financial statements.

MARKET AND CREDIT RISKS

Market Risks

Our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates, commodity
prices and investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund.

Interest Rate and Equity Risk

We have exposure to changing interest rates. Changing interest rates will affect interest
paid on variable-rate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear
decommissioning trust fund (see Note 12). The nuclear decommissioning trust fund also has risks
associated with the changing market value of its investments. Nuclear decommissioning costs are
recovered in regulated electricity prices.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity and natural gas. Our risk management committee, consisting of officers and
key management personnel, oversees company-wide energy risk management activities to ensure
compliance with our stated energy risk management policies. We manage risks associated with these
market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives,
including exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options and swaps. As
part of our risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of
electricity and fuels. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to
price changes in the hedged commodities.

ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY — RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Regulatory Matters

See Note 3 for information about rate matters affecting APS.

Operating Results — 2009 Compared with 2008

APS’ net income for 2009 was $251 million, compared with net income of $262 million for the
comparable prior-year period.

APS’ net income decreased approximately $11 million from the prior-year period primarily due
to lower retail sales resulting from lower usage per customer; higher interest charges, net of
capitalized financing costs; higher depreciation and amortization expenses; and the absence of
income tax benefits related to prior years recorded in 2008. These negative factors were partially
offset by increased revenues due to the interim rate increase effective January 1, 2009 and
transmission rate increases.

Operations and maintenance

Operations and maintenance expenses increased $66 million for 2009
compared with the prior-year period primarily because of:

•

An increase of $62 million related to renewable energy and demand-side management
programs, which are offset in operating revenues;

•

An increase of $29 million in generation costs, including more planned maintenance,
partially offset by lower costs at Palo Verde due to cost efficiency measures; and

•

A decrease of $25 million associated with cost saving measures and other factors,
including the absence of employee severance costs in 2009.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $16 million
for 2009 compared with the prior-year period primarily because of increases in utility plant in
service. The increases in utility plant in service are the result of various improvements to APS’
existing fossil and nuclear generating plants and distribution and transmission infrastructure
additions and upgrades.



Interest charges, net of capitalized financing costs

Interest charges, net of capitalized
financing costs increased $30 million for 2009 compared with the prior-year period primarily
because of higher debt balances, partially offset by the effects of lower interest rates (see
discussion related to APS’ debt issuances in “Pinnacle West Consolidated — Liquidity and Capital
Resources” above). Interest charges, net of capitalized financing costs are comprised of the line
items interest expense, capitalized interest and allowance for equity funds used during
construction from the APS’ Statements of Income.

Other income (expenses), net

Other income (expenses), net improved $17 million for 2009
compared with the prior-year period primarily because of improved investment gains. Other income
(expenses), net is comprised of the line items other income and other expense from the APS’
Statements of Income.

Income taxes

Income taxes were $45 million higher for 2009 compared with the prior-year
period primarily because of $29 million of income tax benefits related to prior years recorded in
2008 and higher pretax income. See Note S-1.

Operating Results — 2008 Compared with 2007

APS’ net income for the year ended 2008 was $262 million, compared with net income of $284
million for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in net income was primarily due to
higher operations and maintenance expenses; lower retail sales due to the effects of weather;
higher depreciation and amortization expenses; and higher interest charges, net of capitalized
financing costs. These negative factors were partially offset by increased revenues due to the
rate increase effective July 1, 2007; transmission rate increases; and income tax benefits related
to prior years recorded in 2008.

infrastructure additions and upgrades.

Interest charges, net of capitalized financing costs

Interest charges, net of capitalized
financing costs increased $13 million for the year ended 2008 compared with the prior year
primarily because of higher rates on certain APS pollution control bonds and higher short-term debt
balances. Interest charges, net of capitalized financing costs, are comprised of the line items
interest expense, capitalized interest and allowance for equity funds used during construction from
the APS Statements of Income.

Other income (expenses), net

Other income (expenses), net reduced earnings by an additional
$20 million for the year ended 2008 compared with the prior year primarily because of lower
interest income. Other income (expenses), net is comprised of the line items other income and
other expense from the APS Statements of Income.

Income taxes

Income taxes were $43 million lower for the year ended 2008 compared with the
prior year primarily because of $18 million of increased income tax benefits related to prior years
resolved in 2008 and 2007. See Note S-1.

(29

2009 Compared with 2008

The increase of approximately $174 million in net cash provided by operating activities is
primarily due to a reduction of collateral and margin cash required as a result of changes in
commodity prices.

The decrease of approximately $141 million in net cash used for investing activities is
primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures net of contributions.

The increase of approximately $286 million in net cash used for financing activities is
primarily due to repayments of short-term borrowings partially offset by APS’ issuance of $500
million of unsecured senior notes (see Note 6).



2008 Compared with 2007

The increase of approximately $19 million in net cash provided by operating activities is
primarily due to lower current income taxes and increased retail revenue related to higher Base
Fuel Rates, partially offset by increased collateral and margin cash provided as a result of
changes in commodity prices.

The decrease of approximately $2 million in net cash used for investing activities is
primarily due to lower levels of capital expenditures (see table and discussion above) and
increased contributions in aid of construction related to changes in 2008 in our line extension
policy (see Note 3), substantially offset by lower cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases
of investment securities.

The increase of approximately $28 million in net cash provided by financing activities is
primarily due to higher levels of short-term borrowings, partially offset by decreased equity
infusions from Pinnacle West and the repurchase of pollution control bonds (see Note 6).

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

(PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION)

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), for Pinnacle West
Capital Corporation. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework,

our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has
been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report which is included herein and also relates to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

February 19, 2010



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Pinnacle West Capital Corporation

Phoenix, Arizona

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation
and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules
listed in the Index at Item 15. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement
schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules and an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009,
based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation and Nature of Operations

Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Pinnacle West and
our subsidiaries: APS, SunCor, APSES, El Dorado and Pinnacle West Marketing & Trading.
Intercompany accounts and transactions between the consolidated companies have been eliminated.

APS is a vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale
electric service to substantially all of the state of Arizona, with the major exceptions of about
one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson metropolitan area and Mohave County in
northwestern Arizona. SunCor is a developer of residential, commercial and industrial real estate
projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho and Utah. APSES provides energy-related projects to
commercial and industrial retail customers in competitive markets in the western United States. In
2008, APSES discontinued its commodity-related energy services (see Note 22). El Dorado is an
investment firm. Pinnacle West Marketing & Trading began operations in early 2007. These
operations were previously conducted by a division of Pinnacle West through the end of 2006. By
the end of 2008, substantially all the contracts were transferred to APS or expired.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we have evaluated the events that have
occurred after December 31, 2009 through the date the financial statements were issued on February
19, 2010.

Our consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments except as otherwise disclosed in the notes) that we believe are necessary
for the fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the
periods presented. These consolidated financial statements and notes have been prepared
consistently with the exception of the reclassification of certain prior year amounts on our
Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with accounting
requirements for reporting discontinued operations (see Note 22), and amended accounting guidance
on reporting noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements (see Note 2). We have
also presented certain line items in more detail in the Consolidated Balance Sheets than was
presented at December 31, 2008. The prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. Customer advances, coal mine reclamation and unrecognized tax benefits are
presented as separate line items instead of the previously reported single line item of other
deferred credits.

Certain
line items are presented in more detail on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
than was presented in the prior years. Other line items are more condensed than the previous
presentation. The prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation. Customer and other receivables and accrued utility revenues are presented as
separate line items instead of the previously reported single line item of customer and other
receivables. Accrued taxes and income tax receivable-net and other current liabilities are
presented as separate line items instead of the previously reported single line item of other
current liabilities. Change in other regulatory liabilities is reported separately from change in
other long-term liabilities. These reclassifications had no impact on total net cash flow provided
by operating activities.

Accounting Records and Use of Estimates

Our accounting records are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Derivative Accounting

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity and natural gas. We manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by
utilizing various instruments that qualify as derivatives, including exchange-traded futures and
options and over-the-counter forwards, options and swaps. As part of our overall risk management
program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels. The
changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged
transactions.

We account for our derivative contracts in accordance with derivatives and hedging guidance,
which requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the
balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. See Note 18 for additional information
about our derivative accounting policies.

Fair Value Measurements

We determine and
disclose the fair value of certain assets and liabilities in accordance with fair value
guidance. Fair value is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a
liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in
an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date. Inputs to fair
value include observable and unobservable data. We maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

We determine fair market value using actively-quoted prices for identical instruments when
available. When actively quoted prices are not available for the identical instruments we use
prices for similar instruments or other corroborative market information or prices provided by
other external sources. For options, long-term contracts and other contracts for which price
quotes are not available, we use unobservable inputs, such as models and other valuation methods,
to determine fair market value.

The use of models and other valuation methods to determine fair market value often requires
subjective and complex judgment. Actual results could differ from the results estimated through
application of these methods. Our structured activities are hedged with a portfolio of forward
purchases that protects the economic value of the sales transactions. Our practice is to hedge
within timeframes established by the ERMC.

See Note 14 for additional information about fair value measurements.

Regulatory Accounting

APS is regulated by the ACC and the FERC. The accompanying financial statements reflect the
rate-making policies of these commissions. As a result, we capitalize certain costs that would be
included as expense in the current period by unregulated companies. Regulatory assets represent
incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer
rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been
collected from customers.

Management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery
by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to
other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction. This determination reflects the current
political and regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future. If future
recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current
period earnings.

A component of our regulatory assets and liabilities is the retail fuel and power costs
deferred under the PSA. APS defers for future rate recovery or refund approximately 90% of the
difference between actual retail fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of such costs
currently included in base rates, subject to specified parameters. See Note 3.

Also included in the balance of regulatory assets at December 31, 2009 is a regulatory asset
for pension and other postretirement benefits. This regulatory asset represents the future
recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings. If these
costs are disallowed by the ACC, this regulatory asset would be charged to OCI and result in lower
future earnings.

Utility Plant and Depreciation

Utility plant is the term we use to describe the business property and equipment that supports
electric service, consisting primarily of generation, transmission and distribution facilities. We
report utility plant at its original cost, which includes:

•

material and labor;

•

contractor costs;

•

capitalized leases;

•

construction overhead costs (where applicable); and

•

capitalized interest or an allowance for funds used during construction.

We expense the costs of plant outages, major maintenance and routine maintenance as incurred.
We charge retired utility plant to accumulated depreciation. Liabilities associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets are recognized at fair value as incurred and capitalized
as part of the related tangible long-lived assets. Accretion of the liability due to the passage
of time is an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the
long-lived asset. See Note 12.

APS records a regulatory liability for the asset retirement obligations related to its
regulated assets. This regulatory liability represents the difference between the amount that has
been recovered in regulated rates and the amount calculated in accordance with guidance on
accounting for asset retirement obligations. APS believes it can recover in regulated rates the
costs capitalized in accordance with this accounting guidance.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We record depreciation on utility plant on a straight-line basis over the remaining useful
life of the related assets. The approximate remaining average useful lives of our utility property
at December 31, 2009 were as follows:

•

Fossil plant — 18 years;

•

Nuclear plant — 17 years;

•

Other generation — 29 years;

•

Transmission — 44 years;

•

Distribution — 32 years; and

•

Other — 8 years.

For the years 2007 through 2009, the depreciation rates ranged from a low of 1.11% to a high
of 12.46%. The weighted-average rate was 3.06% for 2009, 3.08% for 2008 and 3.11% for 2007. We
depreciate non-utility property and equipment over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets, ranging from 3 to 34 years.

Investments

El Dorado accounts for its investments using either the equity method (if significant
influence) or the cost method (if less than 20% ownership).

Our investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund are accounted for in accordance with
guidance on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. See Note 12 for more
information on these investments.

Capitalized Interest

Capitalized interest represents the cost of debt funds used to finance non-regulated
construction projects. Plant construction costs, including capitalized interest, are expensed
through depreciation when completed projects are placed into commercial operation. The rate used to
calculate capitalized interest was a composite rate of 4.4% for 2009, 5.2% for 2008 and 5.8% for
2007. Capitalized interest ceases when construction is complete.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

AFUDC represents the approximate net composite interest cost of borrowed funds and an allowed
return on the equity funds used for construction of regulated utility plant. APS’ allowance for
borrowed funds is included in capitalized interest on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Plant
construction costs, including AFUDC, are recovered in authorized rates through depreciation when
completed projects are placed into commercial operation.

AFUDC was calculated by using a composite rate of 5.9% for 2009, 7.0% for 2008 and 8.2% for
2007. APS compounds AFUDC monthly and ceases to accrue AFUDC when construction work is completed
and the property is placed in service.

Electric Revenues

We derive electric revenues primarily from sales of electricity to our regulated Native Load
customers. Revenues related to the sale of electricity are generally recorded when service is
rendered or electricity is delivered to customers. The billing of electricity sales to individual
Native Load customers is based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis
throughout the month. Unbilled revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue/kWh to the
number of
estimated kWhs delivered but not billed. Differences historically between the actual and
estimated unbilled revenues are immaterial. We exclude sales taxes and franchise fees on electric
revenues from both revenue and taxes other than income taxes.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenues from our Native Load customers and non-derivative instruments are reported on a gross
basis on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income. In the electricity business, some
contracts to purchase energy are netted against other contracts to sell energy. This is called a
“book-out” and usually occurs for contracts that have the same terms (quantities and delivery
points) and for which power does not flow. We net these book-outs, which reduces both revenues and
purchased power and fuel costs.

Effective January 1, 2010, electric revenues will also include proceeds for line extension
payments for new or upgraded service in accordance with the ACC Settlement Agreement (see Note 3).
This revenue treatment will continue through 2012 or until new rates are established in APS’ next
general retail rate case, if that is before year end 2012. Certain proceeds received under
previous versions of the line extension policy, or for activities not involving an extension or
upgrade of service (e.g., service relocations at the request of governmental entities or
undergrounding of overhead facilities) will continue to be treated as
contributions in aid of construction and will not impact electric revenues.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of existing accounts
receivable that will ultimately be uncollectible. The allowance is calculated by applying
estimated write-off factors to various classes of outstanding receivables, including accrued
utility revenues. The write-off factors used to estimate uncollectible accounts are based upon
consideration of both historical collections experience and management’s best estimate of future
collections success given the existing collections environment.

Real Estate Revenues

SunCor recognizes revenue from land, home and qualifying commercial operating assets sales in
full, provided (a) the income is determinable, that is, the collectability of the sales price is
reasonably assured or the amount that will not be collectible can be estimated, and (b) the
earnings process is virtually complete, that is, SunCor is not obligated to perform significant
activities after the sale to earn the income. Unless both conditions exist, recognition of all or
part of the income is postponed under the percentage of completion method in accordance with
accounting guidance relating to sales of real estate. SunCor recognizes income only after the
asset title has passed. Commercial property and management revenues are recorded over the term of
the lease or period in which services are provided. In addition, see Note 22.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Real Estate Investments

Real estate investments primarily include SunCor’s land, home inventory, commercial property
and investments in joint ventures. Land includes acquisition costs, infrastructure costs,
capitalized interest and property taxes directly associated with the acquisition and development of
each project. Home inventory consists of construction costs, improved lot costs, capitalized
interest and property taxes on homes and condos under construction. Homes under construction are
classified as “real estate investments” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; upon completion of
construction they are transferred to “home inventory” with the expectation that they will be sold
in a timely manner.

For the purposes of evaluating impairment, in accordance with the provisions on accounting for
the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, we classify our real estate assets, including land
under development, land held for future development, and commercial property as “held and used.”
When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of real estate assets
considered held and used may not be recoverable, we compare the undiscounted cash flows that we
estimate will be generated by each asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds
the undiscounted cash flows, we adjust the asset to fair value and recognize an impairment charge.
The adjusted value becomes the new book value (carrying amount) for held and used assets. Our
internal models use inputs that we believe are consistent with those that would be used by market
participants.

Real estate home inventory is considered to be held for sale for purposes of evaluating
impairment in accordance with the provisions of accounting for impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets. Home inventories are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to
sell. Fair value less costs to sell is evaluated each period to determine if it has changed.
Losses (and gains not to exceed any cumulative loss previously recognized) are reported as
adjustments to the carrying amount.

Investments in joint ventures for which SunCor does not have a controlling financial interest
are not consolidated, but are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. In addition,
see Note 22 and Note 23.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at
acquisition to be cash equivalents.

Nuclear Fuel

APS amortizes nuclear fuel by using the unit-of-production method. The unit-of-production
method is based on actual physical usage. APS divides the cost of the fuel by the estimated number
of thermal units it expects to produce with that fuel. APS then multiplies that rate by the number
of thermal units produced within the current period. This calculation determines the current
period nuclear fuel expense.

APS also charges nuclear fuel expense for the interim storage and permanent disposal of spent
nuclear fuel. The DOE is responsible for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and charges
APS $0.001 per kWh of nuclear generation. See Note 11 for information on spent nuclear fuel
disposal and Note 12 for information on nuclear decommissioning costs.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability approach prescribed by guidance
relating to accounting for income taxes. We file our federal income tax return on a consolidated
basis and we file our state income tax returns on a consolidated or unitary basis. In accordance
with our intercompany tax sharing agreement, federal and state income taxes are allocated to each
first-tier subsidiary as though each first-tier subsidiary filed a separate income tax return. Any
difference between that method and the consolidated (and unitary) income tax liability is
attributed to the parent company. The income tax liability accounts reflect the tax and interest
associated with management’s estimate of the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50%
likely of being realized upon settlement for all known and measurable tax exposures. See Note 4.

Intangible Assets

We have no goodwill recorded and have separately disclosed other intangible assets, primarily
APS’ software, on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The intangible assets are amortized
over their finite useful lives. Amortization expense was $35 million in 2009, $33 million in 2008
and $37 million in 2007. Estimated amortization expense on existing intangible assets over the
next five years is $33 million in 2010, $27 million in 2011, $23 million in 2012, $18 million in
2013 and $13 million in 2014. At December 31, 2009, the weighted average remaining amortization
period for intangible assets was 7 years.

2. New Accounting Standards

Variable Interest Entities

In June 2009, the FASB issued amended guidance on the consolidation of variable interest
entities. The model for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest and is
the primary beneficiary of a VIE has changed significantly under the new guidance. Previously,
variable interest holders had to determine whether they had a controlling financial interest in a
VIE based on a quantitative analysis of the expected gains and/or losses of the entity. The new
guidance requires an enterprise with a variable interest in a VIE to perform a qualitative
assessment in determining whether it has a controlling financial interest in the entity, and if so,
whether it is the primary beneficiary. Furthermore, the amended guidance requires companies to
continually evaluate VIEs for consolidation. This guidance was effective for us on January 1, 2010.
We are continuing to evaluate the impact this new guidance may have
on our financial statements. See Note 20.

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

We adopted guidance relating to fair value measurements and disclosures for our non-financial
assets on January 1, 2009. This guidance was adopted for our financial assets on January 1, 2008.

On April 1, 2009, we adopted new fair value accounting provisions on the following topics:

•

Determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or
liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not
orderly.

•

The recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments.

•

Interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments.

On October 1, 2009, we adopted new fair value accounting provisions on the following topics:

•

Measuring fair value of liabilities, which provides additional guidance on how fair
value measurements of liabilities should be determined.

•

Measuring fair value of certain alternative investments. This guidance provides
clarification on the measurement and disclosure of investments in entities that
calculate net asset value.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The adoption of fair value measurement and disclosure guidance has not had a significant
impact on our financial statement results. See Note 14 for fair value discussions and related
disclosures.

In January 2010 guidance was issued that amends the fair value disclosure requirements. This
guidance adds new fair value disclosures and clarifies existing disclosure requirements. This
amended guidance is effective for us during the first quarter of 2010. The adoption of this new
guidance will not have an impact on our financial statement results.

Derivative Instruments

We adopted amended guidance on disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities
on January 1, 2009. See Note 18 for additional information and related disclosures. Since this
guidance provides only disclosure requirements, the adoption of this standard did not impact our
financial statement results.

Noncontrolling Interests

We adopted amended guidance on reporting noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial
statements on January 1, 2009. This guidance provides accounting and reporting standards for
noncontrolling interests in a consolidated subsidiary and clarifies that noncontrolling interests
should be reported as equity on the consolidated financial statements. As a result of adopting
this guidance, we have disclosed on the face of our financial statements the portion of equity and
net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries.
Additionally, we reclassified $47 million of noncontrolling interests from other deferred credits
to equity on the December 31, 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior year’s net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material to our Consolidated Statements of Income
and was not reclassified. The adoption of this guidance modified our financial statement
presentation, but did not have an impact on our financial statement results.

Employers’
Disclosure about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

In December 2008, the FASB issued guidance on employers’ disclosures about postretirement
benefit plan assets. This guidance requires enhanced disclosures about employers’ plan assets of a
defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan including fair value related disclosures. We
adopted this guidance during the fourth quarter of 2009. See Note 8 for the related disclosures.
The adoption of this guidance expanded certain disclosures but did not have an impact on our
financial statement results.

Subsequent Events

In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance which established general standards of accounting for
and disclosure of subsequent events. Subsequent events are events that occur after the balance
sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. We adopted
this guidance
during the second quarter of 2009. The adoption of this guidance expanded certain disclosures
but did not have an impact on our financial statement results.

3. Regulatory Matters

2008 General Retail Rate Case Decision

On December 30, 2009, the ACC issued an order approving a settlement agreement (“Settlement
Agreement”) entered into by APS and twenty-one other parties to its general retail rate case, which
was originally filed in March 2008. The ACC approved the Settlement Agreement with modifications
and obligations for APS that did not materially affect the overall economic terms of the
settlement.

The Settlement Agreement includes a net retail rate increase of $207.5 million, which
represents a base rate increase of $344.7 million less a reclassification of $137.2 million of fuel
and purchased power revenues from the existing PSA to base rates. The new rates were effective
January 1, 2010.

The parties also agreed to a rate case filing plan in which APS is prohibited from filing its
next two general rate cases until on or after June 1, 2011 and June 1, 2013, respectively, unless
certain extraordinary events occur. Subject to the foregoing, APS may not request its next general
retail rate increase to be effective prior to July 1, 2012. The parties agreed to use good faith
efforts to process these subsequent rate cases within twelve months of sufficiency findings from
the ACC staff, which generally occur within 30 days after the filing of a rate case.

Other key provisions of the Settlement Agreement, effective January 1, 2010, include the
following:

•

A non-fuel base rate increase in annual pretax revenues of $196.3 million;

•

A net increase in annual pretax revenues of $11.2 million for fuel and purchased
power costs reflected in base rates that would not otherwise have been recoverable
under the PSA;

•

A Base Fuel Rate of $0.0376 per kWh (compared to the prior Base Fuel Rate of $0.0325
per kWh);

•

Revenue accounting treatment for line extension payments received for new or
upgraded service from January 1, 2010 through year end 2012 (or until new rates are
established in APS’ next general rate case, if that is before the end of 2012),
resulting in present estimates of increased revenues of $23 million, $25 million and
$49 million, respectively;

•

An authorized return on common equity of 11.0%;

•

A capital structure comprised of 46.2% debt and 53.8% common equity;



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

•

A commitment from APS to reduce average annual operational expenses by at least $30
million from 2010 through 2014;

•

Authorization and requirements of equity infusions into APS of at least $700 million
during the period beginning June 1, 2009 through December 31, 2014; and

•

Various modifications to the existing energy efficiency, demand-side management and
renewable energy programs that require APS to, among other things, expand its
conservation and demand-side management programs and its use of renewable energy, as
well as allow for concurrent recovery of renewable energy expenses and provide for more
concurrent recovery of demand-side management costs and incentives.

Cost Recovery Mechanisms

APS has received supportive regulatory decisions that allow for more timely recovery of
certain costs through the following recovery mechanisms.

Renewable Energy Standard.

In 2006, the ACC approved the Arizona Renewable Energy Standard
and Tariff (“RES”). Under the RES, electric utilities that are regulated by the ACC must supply an
increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources,
including solar, wind, biomass, biogas and geothermal technologies. In order to achieve these
requirements, the ACC allows APS to include an RES surcharge on customer bills to recover the
approved amounts for use on renewable energy projects. Each year APS is required to file a
five-year implementation plan with the ACC and seek approval for the upcoming year’s RES funding
amount.

During 2009, APS filed its annual RES implementation plan, covering the 2010-2014 timeframe
and requesting 2010 RES funding approval. The plan provides for the acquisition of renewable
generation in compliance with requirements through 2014, and requests RES funding of $86.7 million
for 2010. APS also seeks various other determinations in its plan, including approval of the AZ
Sun program, which provides for 100 MW of utility-owned solar resources through 2014 and recovery
of associated costs through the RES adjustor until such costs can be recovered through APS’ base
rates or alternative mechanisms. At its December open meeting, the ACC approved APS’ 2010 RES
funding request, and deferred action on other portions of APS’ plan including the AZ Sun matter.
On February 10, 2010, the ACC staff issued a recommendation that the ACC approve APS’ request on
the AZ Sun matter. It is expected that the ACC will make a determination on this matter in March
2010.

Demand-Side Management Adjustor Charge.

The Settlement Agreement requires APS to submit an
annual Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan for review by and approval of the ACC. On July 15,
2009, APS filed its initial Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan, requesting approval by the ACC
of programs and program elements for which APS has estimated a budget in the amount of $49.9
million for 2010. In order to recover these estimated amounts for use on certain demand-side
management programs, a surcharge would be added to customer bills similar to that described above
under the RES. The surcharge will offset energy efficiency expenses and allow for the recovery of
any earned incentives. APS received ACC approval of all but one of its proposed programs and
expects to receive a determination from the ACC on the remaining program in the near future.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The ACC approved recovery of the 2010 Energy Efficiency budget less some $1.0 million, which
reflected a recalculation of the incentive payment due to APS under the Energy Efficiency
Implementation Plan and not a reduction in allowed program costs. The ACC also approved recovery
of all 2009 program costs plus incentives. The change from program cost recovery on a historical
basis to recovery on a concurrent basis, as authorized in the Settlement Agreement, resulted in this
one-time need to address two years (2009 and 2010) of cost recovery. As requested by APS, 2009
program cost recovery is to be spread over a three-year period.

PSA Mechanism and Balance.

The PSA, which the ACC initially approved in 2005 as a part of
APS’ 2003 rate case, and which was modified by the ACC in 2007, provides for the adjustment of
retail rates to reflect variations in retail fuel and purchased power costs. The PSA is subject to
specified parameters and procedures, including the following:

•

APS records deferrals for recovery or refund to the extent actual retail fuel and
purchased power costs vary from the Base Fuel Rate;

•

under a 90/10 sharing arrangement, APS defers 90% of the difference between retail
fuel and purchased power costs (excluding certain costs, such as renewable energy
resources and the capacity components of long-term purchase power agreements acquired
through competitive procurement) and the Base Fuel Rate; APS absorbs 10% of the retail
fuel and purchased power costs above the Base Fuel Rate and retains 10% of the benefit
from the retail fuel and purchased power costs that are below the Base Fuel Rate;

•

an adjustment to the PSA rate is made annually each February 1

st

(unless
otherwise approved by the ACC) and goes into effect automatically unless suspended by
the ACC;

•

the PSA uses a forward-looking estimate of fuel and purchased power costs to set the
annual PSA rate, which will be reconciled to actual costs experienced for each PSA Year
(February 1 through January 31) (see the following bullet point); and

•

the PSA rate includes (a) a “Forward Component,” under which APS recovers or refunds
differences between expected fuel and purchased power costs for the upcoming calendar
year and those embedded in the Base Fuel Rate; (b) a “Historical Component,” under
which differences between actual fuel and purchased power costs and those recovered
through the combination of the Base Fuel Rate and the Forward Component are recovered
during the next PSA Year; and (c) a “Transition Component,” under which APS may seek
mid-year PSA changes due to large variances between actual fuel and purchased power
costs and the combination of the Base Fuel Rate and the Forward Component.

The PSA rate for the PSA Year that began February 1, 2010 was set at ($0.0045) per kWh. The
$87 million regulatory liability at December 31, 2009 reflected lower average prices and the
seasonal nature of fuel and purchased power costs. These overcollected fuel cost deferrals during
the 2009 PSA Year were refunded through the historical component of the PSA rate for the PSA Year
beginning February 1, 2010. Since this 2010 PSA adjustment was a reduction of the PSA rate, the
ACC accelerated the 2010 adjustment from February 1

st

to January 1

st

to
coincide with the increase in retail rates resulting from the ACC’s decision in the general retail
rate case, causing a minimal net impact on residential bills. This accelerated 2010 adjustment
will remain in effect until February 1, 2011.

The PSA rate for the PSA Year that began February 1, 2009 was $0.0053 per kWh. The PSA rate
may not be increased or decreased more than $0.004 per kWh in a year without permission of the ACC.

Transmission Rates and Transmission Cost Adjustor

.

In July 2008, the FERC approved an Open
Access Transmission Tariff for APS to move from fixed rates to a formula rate-setting methodology
in order to more accurately reflect the costs that APS incurs in providing transmission services.
The formula rate is updated each year effective June 1 on the basis of APS’ actual cost of service,
as disclosed in APS’ FERC Form 1 report for the previous fiscal year, and projected capital
expenditures. A large portion of the rate represents charges for transmission services to serve
APS’ retail customers (“Retail Transmission Charges”). In order to recover the Retail Transmission
Charges, APS must file an application with, and obtain approval from, the ACC under the TCA
mechanism, by which changes in Retail Transmission Charges can be reflected in APS’ retail rates.

In 2009, APS was authorized to implement an increase in its annual transmission revenues based
on calculations filed with the FERC using data for its 2008 fiscal year. Increases in APS’ annual
transmission revenues of $22.8 million became effective June 1, 2009. Of this amount, $21 million
represents an increase in Retail Transmission Charges, which was approved by the ACC on July 29,
2009 and allows APS to reflect the related increased Retail Transmission Charges in its retail
rates through the TCA effective August 1, 2009.

4. Income Taxes

Certain assets and liabilities are reported differently for income tax purposes than they are
for financial statements purposes. The tax effect of these differences is recorded as deferred
taxes. We calculate deferred taxes using the current income tax rates.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APS has recorded a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability related to income taxes on its
Balance Sheets in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated operations. The regulatory
asset is for certain temporary differences, primarily the allowance for equity funds used during
construction. The regulatory liability relates to deferred taxes resulting primarily from pension
and other postretirement benefits. APS amortizes these amounts as the differences reverse.

Pinnacle West expects to recognize approximately $125 million of cash tax benefits related to
SunCor’s strategic asset sales (see Note 23) which will not be realized until the asset sale
transactions are completed. Approximately $105 million of these benefits were recorded in 2009 as
reductions to income tax expense related to the current impairment charges. The additional $20
million of tax benefits were recorded as reductions to income tax expense related to the SunCor
impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.

The $91 million income tax receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represent the
anticipated refunds related to an APS tax accounting method change approved by the IRS in the third
quarter of 2009 and the current year tax benefits related to the SunCor strategic asset sales that
closed in 2009.

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits,
excluding interest and penalties, at the beginning and end of the period that are included in
accrued taxes and unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (dollars in
thousands):

Included in both balances of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were
approximately $16 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would decrease our effective tax
rate.

As of the balance sheet date, the tax year ended December 31, 2005 and all subsequent tax
years remain subject to examination by the IRS. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to
state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 1999.

Within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the Company will reach a settlement
with the IRS with regard to the examination of tax returns for years ended December 31, 2005
through 2007. As a result of these anticipated settlements, and the expiration of certain statutes
of limitations, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits
could be reduced by an amount up to $70 million.

We reflect interest and penalties, if any, on unrecognized tax benefits in the Consolidated
Statements of Income as income tax expense. The amount of interest recognized in the consolidated
statement of income related to unrecognized tax benefits was a pre-tax expense of $2 million
for 2009 and pre-tax benefit of $51 million for 2008.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The total amount of accrued liabilities for interest recognized in the consolidated balance
sheets related to unrecognized tax benefits was $8 million as of December 31, 2009 and $6 million
as of December 31, 2008. To the extent that matters are settled favorably, this amount could
reverse and decrease our effective tax rate. Additionally, as of December 31, 2009, we have
recognized $1 million of interest expense to be paid on the underpayment of income taxes for
certain adjustments that we have filed, or will file, with the IRS.

5. Lines of Credit and Short-Term Borrowing

Pinnacle West and APS maintain credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and provide
credit support. The credit and liquidity markets experienced significant stress beginning in the
third quarter of 2008. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, Pinnacle West and APS have not accessed
the commercial paper market due to negative market conditions. They have both been able to access
existing credit facilities, ensuring adequate liquidity. The table below presents the consolidated

Pinnacle West had a committed line of credit with various banks totaling $300 million at
December 31, 2008. Credit commitments totaling approximately $17 million from Lehman Brothers were
no longer available. The remaining $283 million was available to support the issuance of up to
$250 million in commercial paper or bank borrowings, including issuances of letters of credit up to
$94 million of which $7 million was outstanding.

APS had committed lines of credit totaling $900 million at December 31, 2008. Credit
commitments totaling approximately $34 million from Lehman Brothers were no longer available. The
remaining capacity of $866 million under the APS revolvers was available either to support the
issuance of up to $250 million in commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings, including
issuances of letters of credit up to $583 million.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On February 12, 2010, Pinnacle West refinanced its $283 million revolving credit facility that
would have matured in December 2010, and decreased the size of the facility to $200 million. The
new revolving credit facility terminates in February 2013. Pinnacle West may increase the amount
of the facility up to a maximum of $300 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and
with the consent of the lenders. Pinnacle West will use the facility for general corporate
purposes, repayment of long-term debt, and for the issuance of letters of credit. Interest rates
are based on Pinnacle West’s senior unsecured debt credit ratings. In addition, because of the
downsized revolving credit facility, the Company is in the process of reducing the size of its
commercial paper program to $200 million from $250 million.

On February 12, 2010, APS refinanced its $377 million revolving credit facility that would
have matured in December 2010, and increased the size of the facility to $500 million. The new
revolving credit facility terminates in February 2013. APS may increase the amount of the facility
up to a maximum of $700 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and with the consent of
the lenders. APS will use the facility for general corporate purposes and for the issuance of
letters of credit. Interest rates are based on APS’ senior unsecured debt credit ratings.

Although provisions in APS’ articles of incorporation and ACC financing orders establish
maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that APS may issue, APS does not expect any of these
provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements. On October 30, 2007, the ACC
issued a financing order in which it approved APS’ request, subject to specified parameters and
procedures, to increase (a) APS’ short-term debt authorization from 7% of APS’ capitalization to
(i) 7% of APS’ capitalization plus (ii) $500 million (which is required to be used for purchases of
natural gas and power) and (b) APS’ long-term debt authorization from approximately $3.2 billion to
$4.2 billion in light of the projected growth of APS and its customer base and the resulting
projected financing needs. This financing order expires December 31, 2012; however, all debt
previously authorized and outstanding on December 31, 2012 will remain authorized and valid
obligations of APS.

See discussion about SunCor’s Secured Revolver in Note 6.

Other Short-term Borrowings

Neither Pinnacle West nor APS had commercial paper borrowings or other short-term debt at
December 31, 2009 or December 31, 2008. SunCor had other short-term notes of approximately $5
million at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 with variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus

During 2009, APS refinanced approximately $343 million of its $656 million pollution control
bonds. As a result of these refinancings, which are described in the following table, APS no
longer has any outstanding debt securities in auction rate mode. Each series of bonds, described
below, is payable solely from revenues obtained from APS pursuant to a loan agreement between APS
and the respective pollution control corporation. The interest rates on these bonds are fixed
through the applicable interest reset dates as presented in the table below. At the interest reset
dates, we will be required to purchase the bonds and will have the opportunity to remarket
the bonds in daily, weekly, monthly or other interest rate modes at that time. These bonds are classified as
long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009.

1996A and Series 1999 due December 2031 and April 2034 and held them as treasury bonds. On
September 22, 2009, Coconino issued approximately $27 million of Coconino Pollution Control Revenue
Refunding Bonds, 2009 Series B due April 2038 to redeem the existing bonds. APS used the funds
received from the issuance to repay certain existing indebtedness under a revolving line of credit
drawn upon by APS to fund its purchase of the 1996A and 1999 Series Bonds in 2008. The 2009 Series
B Bonds are payable solely from revenues obtained from APS pursuant to a loan agreement
between APS and Coconino. According to the indenture of the bonds, the interest rate of the 2009
Series B Bonds could be reset daily, weekly, monthly, or at other time intervals. The initial rate
period selected for the 2009 Series B Bonds is a daily rate period. At December 31, 2009, the daily
interest rate was 0.26%. The daily rates are variable rates set by a remarketing agent.
Concurrently with the issuance of the 2009 Series B Bonds, the Company entered into a two year
letter of credit and reimbursement agreement to provide credit support for the 2009 Series B Bonds.
These bonds are classified as long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31,
2009.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Approximately $196 million of pollution control bonds were classified as current maturities of
long-term debt at December 31, 2009. Currently, interest rates on these bonds are set daily by a
remarketing agent. Additionally, the bonds are backed by letters of credit that expire in 2010, at
which time the letters of credit will have to be replaced, renewed or extended, or the bonds will
have to be remarketed in a different interest rate mode. The bond holders will have to surrender
the bonds back to APS if APS decides to remarket them in a different interest rate mode.

The interest rate on the remaining $90 million of pollution control bonds with senior notes
is fixed for life, and the bonds are also backed by insurance. The bonds are classified as
long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009.

Debt Provisions

Pinnacle West’s and APS’ debt covenants related to their respective bank financing
arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios. Certain of APS’ bank financing arrangements
also include an interest coverage test. Pinnacle West and APS comply with these covenants and each
anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements. For both
Pinnacle West and APS, these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total
consolidated capitalization not exceed 65%. At December 31, 2009, the ratio was approximately 52%
for Pinnacle West and 48% for APS. The provisions regarding interest coverage require minimum cash
coverage of two times the interest requirements for APS. The interest coverage was approximately
4.6 times under APS’ bank financing agreements as of December 31, 2009. Failure to comply with such
covenant levels would result in an event of default which, generally speaking, would require the
immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross-default other debt. See
further discussion of “cross-default” provisions below.

Neither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’ financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would
result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating
downgrade. However, our bank financing agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest
costs we pay are determined by our current credit ratings.

All of Pinnacle West’s loan agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in
defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or
APS were to default under certain other material agreements. All of APS’ bank agreements contain
cross default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment
under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.
Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings.

An existing ACC order requires APS to maintain a common equity ratio of at least 40%. As
defined in the ACC order, the common equity ratio is common equity divided by the sum of common
equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt. At December 31, 2009,
APS common equity ratio, as defined, was 50%. Its total common equity was approximately $3.4
billion, and total capitalization was approximately $6.8 billion. APS would be prohibited from
paying dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below approximately $2.7 billion,
assuming APS’ total capitalization remains the same. This restriction does not materially affect
Pinnacle West’s ability to meet its ongoing capital requirements.

SunCor

— SunCor's principal loan facility,
the SunCor Secured Revolver, is secured primarily by an interest in land, commercial properties, land contracts and homes under construction.
At December 31, 2009, SunCor had borrowings of approximately $57 million under the Secured Revolver.  The revolver matured on January 30, 2010.
SunCor and the agent bank for the Secured Revolver are discussing an extension of the maturity date to allow time for SunCor to continue
discussions concerning the potential sale of additional properties.  In addition to the Secured Revolver, at December 31, 2009, SunCor had
approximately $43 million of outstanding debt under other credit facilities ($9 million of which has matured since December 31, 2009 and remains
outstanding).  SunCor intends to apply the proceeds of planned asset sales (see Note 23) to the
repayment of its outstanding debt.

Real estate impairment charges recorded throughout 2009
(see Note 23) resulted in violations of certain covenants contained in the SunCor Secured
Revolver and SunCor's other credit facilities.  The lenders have taken no enforcement action
related to the covenant defaults.

If SunCor is unable to
obtain an extension or renewal of the Secured Revolver or its other matured debt, or if it is
unable to comply with the mandatory repayment and other provisions of any new or modified credit
agreements, SunCor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all
of its credit facilities as a result of cross-default provisions.  Such an immediate repayment
obligation would have a material adverse impact on SunCor's business and financial position and
impair its ongoing viability.

SunCor cannot predict
the outcome of negotiations with its lenders or its ability to sell assets for sufficient proceeds
to repay its outstanding debt.  SunCor's ability to generate sufficient cash from operations while
it pursues lender negotiations and further asset sales is uncertain.

Neither Pinnacle West
nor any of its other subsidiaries has guaranteed any SunCor indebtedness.  A SunCor debt default
would not result in a cross-default of any of the debt of Pinnacle West or any of its other
subsidiaries.  While there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of this matter,
Pinnacle West does not believe that SunCor's inability to obtain waivers or similar relief from
SunCor's lenders would have a material adverse impact on Pinnacle West's cash flows or liquidity.

As of December 31,
2009, SunCor could not transfer any cash dividends to Pinnacle West as a result of the covenants
mentioned above.  The restriction does not materially affect Pinnacle West's ability to meet its
ongoing capital requirements.

8. Retirement Plans and Other Benefits

Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a
non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and
its subsidiaries. All new employees participate in the account balance plan. Defined benefit
plans specify the amount of benefits a plan participant is to receive using information about the
participant. The pension plan covers nearly all employees. The supplemental excess benefit
retirement plan covers officers of the Company and highly compensated employees designated for
participation by the Board of Directors. Our employees do not contribute to the plans. Generally,
we calculate the benefits based on age, years of service and pay.

We also sponsor other postretirement benefits for the employees of Pinnacle West and our
subsidiaries. We provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees. Employees must
retire to become eligible for these retirement benefits, which are based on years of service and
age. For the medical insurance plans, retirees make contributions to cover a portion of the plan
costs. For the life insurance plan, retirees do not make contributions. We retain the right to
change or eliminate these benefits.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Pinnacle West uses a December 31 measurement date each year for its pension and other
postretirement benefit plans. The market-related value of our plan assets is their fair value at
the measurement date. See Note 14 for discussion of how fair values are determined. Due to
subjective and complex judgments, which may be required in determining fair values, actual results could
differ from the results estimated through the application of these methods.

A significant portion of the changes in the actuarial gains and losses of our pension and
postretirement plans is attributable to APS and therefore is recoverable in rates. Accordingly,
these changes are recorded as a regulatory asset. In its 2009 retail rate case settlement, APS
received approval to defer a portion of pension and other postretirement benefit cost increases
incurred in 2011 and 2012.

The following table provides details of the plans’ net periodic benefit costs and the portion

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In selecting the pretax expected long-term rate of return on plan assets we consider past
performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan. For the year
2010, we are assuming an 8.25% long-term rate of return on plan assets, which we believe is
reasonable given our asset allocation in relation to historical and expected performance.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the
health care plans. In selecting our health care trend rate, we consider past performance and
forecasts of health care costs. A one percentage point change in the assumed initial and ultimate
health care cost trend rates would have the following effects (dollars in millions):

Plan Assets

The Board of Directors has delegated oversight of the Plans’ assets to an Investment
Management Committee, which has adopted an investment policy. The investment policy’s overall
strategy is to achieve an adequate level of trust assets relative to the benefit obligation. To
achieve this objective, the Plans’ investment policies provide for a mix of investments in
long-term fixed income assets and return-generating assets. Long-term fixed income assets are
designed to offset changes in benefit obligations due to changes in discount rates and inflation.
Return-generating assets are intended to provide a reasonable long-term rate of investment return
with a prudent level of volatility. The determination of total allocation between
return-generating and long-term fixed income assets is reviewed on at least an annual basis. Other
investment strategies include the prohibition of investments in Pinnacle West securities and the
external management of the Plans’ assets.

Long-term fixed income assets consist primarily of fixed income debt securities issued by the
U.S. Treasury, other government agencies, and corporations. Long-term fixed income assets may also
include interest rate swaps, U.S. Treasury futures and other instruments. The investment policy
does not provide for a specific mix of long-term fixed income assets, but does require the average
credit rating of such assets to be considered upper medium grade or above. The 2009 year-end
long-term fixed income asset strategy focused on investments in corporate bonds of primarily
investment-grade U.S. issuers, with total long-term fixed income assets representing 45% of total
pension plan assets and 40% of other benefit plans assets.

Return-generating assets in the pension plan and other benefit plans target a mix of
approximately 64% U.S. equities, 27% international equities, and 9% alternative investments. The
2009 year-end U.S. equity holdings were invested primarily in large-cap companies in diverse
industries. International equities include investments in emerging and developing markets.
Return-generating assets also include investments in securities through commingled funds in common
and collective trusts. Alternative investments primarily include investments in real estate. The
2009 year-end return-generating assets represented 55% of total pension plan assets and 60% of other
benefit plans assets.

Employee Savings Plan Benefits

Pinnacle West sponsors a defined contribution savings plan for eligible employees of Pinnacle
West and its subsidiaries. In 2009, costs related to APS’ employees represented 97% of the total
cost of this plan. In a defined contribution savings plan, the benefits a participant receives
result from regular contributions participants make to their own individual account, the Company’s
matching contributions and earnings or losses on their investments. Under this plan, the Company
matches a percentage of the participants’ contributions in cash which is then invested in the same
investment mix as participants elect to invest their own future contributions. Pinnacle West
recorded expenses for this plan of approximately $9 million for 2009, $8 million for 2008 and $7
million for 2007.

9. Leases

In 1986, APS sold about 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain common facilities in
three separate sale leaseback transactions. APS accounts for these leases as operating leases.
The gain resulting from the transaction of approximately $140 million was deferred and is being
amortized to operations and maintenance expense over 29.5 years, the original term of the leases.
There are options to renew the leases or to purchase the property for fair market value at the end
of the lease terms. APS must give notice to the respective lessors between December 31, 2010 and
December 31, 2012 if it wishes to exercise, or not exercise, either of these options. We are
analyzing these options. Rent expense is calculated on a straight-line basis. See Note 20 for a
discussion of VIEs, including the VIE’s involved in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions.

In addition, we lease certain vehicles, land, buildings, equipment and miscellaneous other
items through operating rental agreements with varying terms, provisions and expiration dates.

Total lease expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $73 million in
2009, $74 million in 2008 and $73 million in 2007. APS’ lease expense was $64 million in 2009, $67
million in 2008 and $66 million in 2007.

The amounts to be paid for the Palo Verde Unit 2 leases are approximately $49 million per year
for the years 2010 to 2015.

Estimated future minimum lease payments for Pinnacle West’s and APS’ operating leases,
excluding purchase power agreements, are approximately as follows (dollars in millions):

11. Commitments and Contingencies

Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station

Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal

Nuclear power plant operators are required to enter into spent fuel disposal contracts
with the DOE, and the DOE is required to accept and dispose of all spent nuclear fuel and other
high-level radioactive wastes generated by domestic power reactors. Although the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act required the DOE to develop a permanent repository for the storage and disposal of spent
nuclear fuel by 1998, the DOE has announced that the repository cannot be completed before at least
2017. In November 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
(D.C. Circuit) issued a decision preventing the DOE from excusing its own delay, but refused to
order the DOE to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel. Based on



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

this decision and the DOE’s delay, a
number of utilities, including APS (on behalf of itself and the other Palo Verde owners), filed damages actions against
the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. APS is currently pursuing that damages claim. In August
2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued decisions in three damages
actions brought by other nuclear utilities that resulted in APS revising its damages claim prior to
trial. The trial in the APS matter began on January 28, 2009, and closing arguments were heard in
late May 2009. The court has not indicated when it will reach its decision in the matter. In
January 2010, on appeal of another utility’s damages case in which the DOE successfully raised the
unavoidable delays defense, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the lower court’s
decision and concluded that the Court of Federal Claims, the court handling the APS matter, is
bound by the November 1997 D.C. Circuit decision that prevents the DOE from excusing its delay in
performance.

APS currently estimates it will incur $132 million (in 2009 dollars) over the current life of
Palo Verde for its share of the costs related to the on-site interim storage of spent nuclear fuel.
At December 31, 2009, APS had a regulatory liability of $34 million that represents amounts
recovered in retail rates in excess of amounts spent for on-site interim spent fuel storage.

Nuclear Insurance

The Palo Verde participants are insured against public liability for a nuclear incident up to
$12.6 billion per occurrence. As required by the Price Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act,
Palo Verde maintains the maximum available nuclear liability insurance in the amount of $375
million, which is provided by commercial insurance carriers. The remaining balance of $12.2
billion is provided through a mandatory industry wide retrospective assessment program. If losses
at any nuclear power plant covered by the program exceed the accumulated funds, APS could be
assessed retrospective premium adjustments. The maximum assessment per reactor under the program
for each nuclear incident is approximately $118 million, subject to an annual limit of $18 million
per incident, to be periodically adjusted for inflation. Based on APS’ interest in the three Palo
Verde units, APS’ maximum potential assessment per incident for all three units is approximately
$103 million, with an annual payment limitation of approximately $15 million.

The Palo Verde participants maintain “all risk” (including nuclear hazards) insurance for
property damage to, and decontamination of, property at Palo Verde in the aggregate amount of $2.75
billion, a substantial portion of which must first be applied to stabilization and decontamination.
APS has also secured insurance against portions of any increased cost of generation or purchased
power and business interruption resulting from a sudden and unforeseen accidental outage of any of
the three units. The property damage, decontamination, and replacement power coverages are
provided by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (“NEIL”). APS is subject to retrospective
assessments under all NEIL policies if NEIL’s losses in any policy year exceed accumulated funds.
The maximum amount APS could incur under the current NEIL policies totals approximately $19 million
for each retrospective assessment declared by NEIL’s Board of Directors due to losses. In
addition, NEIL policies contain rating triggers that would result in APS providing approximately
$52 million of collateral assurance within 20 business days of a rating downgrade to non-investment
grade. The insurance coverage discussed in this and the previous paragraph is subject to certain
policy conditions and exclusions.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

Pinnacle West and APS are parties to various fuel and purchased power contracts with terms
expiring between 2010 and 2042 that include required purchase provisions. Pinnacle West and APS
estimate the contract requirements to be approximately $444 million in 2010; $336 million in 2011;
$351 million in 2012; $457 million in 2013; $490 million in 2014; and $6.4 billion thereafter.
However, these amounts may vary significantly pursuant to certain provisions in such contracts that
permit us to decrease required purchases under certain circumstances.

Of the various fuel and purchased power contracts mentioned above, some of those contracts
have take-or-pay provisions. The contracts APS has for its coal supply include take-or-pay
provisions. The current take-or-pay coal contracts have terms that expire in 2024.

The following table summarizes our actual and estimated take-or-pay commitments (dollars in
millions):

Total take-or-pay commitments are approximately $721 million. The total net
present value of these commitments is approximately $501 million.

Renewable Energy Credits

APS has entered into contracts to purchase renewable energy credits to comply with
the Renewable Energy Standard. APS estimates the contract requirements to be approximately $48
million in 2010; $15 million in 2011; $15 million in 2012; $15 million in 2013; $15 million in
2014; and $142 million thereafter.

Coal Mine Reclamation Obligations

APS must reimburse certain coal providers for amounts incurred for coal mine reclamation.
APS’ coal mine reclamation obligation was approximately $92 million at December 31, 2009 and $91
million at December 31, 2008.

California Energy Market Issues and Refunds in the Pacific Northwest

In July 2001, the FERC ordered an expedited fact-finding hearing to calculate refunds for spot
market transactions in California during a specified time frame. APS was a seller and a purchaser
in the California markets at issue and, to the extent that refunds are ordered, APS should be a
recipient as well as a payor of such amounts. In addition, on March 19, 2002, the State of
California filed a complaint with the FERC alleging that wholesale sellers of power and energy,
including APS, failed to properly file rate information at the FERC in connection with sales to
California from 2000 to March 2002 under market-based rates. Since 2004, the Ninth Circuit and the
FERC have issued various decisions and orders involving the aforementioned issues, including
decisions related to: entities subject to FERC jurisdiction and, therefore, potentially owing
refunds; applicable refund



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

methodologies; the temporal scope and types of transactions that are
properly subject to the refund orders; and the appropriate standard of review at the FERC on wholesale power contracts in the
refund proceedings. A settlement, resolving APS’ issues with certain California parties for the
current refund period, was approved by the FERC in an order issued on June 30, 2008. The
resolution of the claims related to the parties involved in this settlement had no material adverse
impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We currently believe the
refund claims at the FERC related to the parties not involved in this settlement will have no
material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On July 25, 2001, the FERC also ordered an evidentiary proceeding to discuss and evaluate
possible refunds for wholesale sales in the Pacific Northwest. The FERC affirmed the
administrative law judge’s conclusion that the prices in the Pacific Northwest were not
unreasonable or unjust and refunds should not be ordered in this proceeding. This decision was
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On August 24, 2007, the Ninth Circuit
issued an opinion that remanded the proceeding to the FERC for further consideration. Although the
FERC has not yet determined whether any refunds will ultimately be required, we do not expect that
the resolution of these issues will have a material adverse impact on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Superfund

Superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating
the soil, water or air. Those who generated, transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a
contaminated site are among those who are PRPs. PRPs may be strictly, and often are jointly and
severally, liable for clean-up. On September 3, 2003, the EPA advised APS that the EPA considers
APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52

nd

Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 (OU3) in
Phoenix, Arizona. APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site. APS and Pinnacle West
have agreed with the EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS facilities within
OU3. In addition, on September 23, 2009, APS agreed with the EPA and one other PRP to voluntarily
assist with the funding and management of the site-wide groundwater remedial investigation and
feasibility study work plan. We estimate that our costs related to this investigation and study
will be approximately $1.2 million, which is reserved as a liability on our financial statements.
We anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future, but because the overall
investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized, at the
present time we cannot accurately estimate our total expenditures.

Landlord Bankruptcy

On April 16, 2009, the landlord for our corporate headquarters building announced that it is
seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. We currently have several
assets on our books related to our landlord, the most significant of which is an asset related to
levelized rent payments for the building of approximately $66 million. This amount will continue
to increase to approximately $94 million as a result of the lease terms until 2015, when this
amount will begin to decrease over the remaining life of the lease. We are monitoring this matter
and, while there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of the matter due to the
complexity of the bankruptcy proceedings, we currently do not expect that it will have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

12. Asset Retirement Obligations and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust

APS has asset retirement obligations for its Palo Verde nuclear facilities and certain other
generation, transmission and distribution assets. The Palo Verde asset retirement obligation
primarily relates to final plant decommissioning. This obligation is based on the NRC’s
requirements for disposal of radiated property or plant and agreements APS reached with the ACC for
final decommissioning of the plant. The non-nuclear generation asset retirement obligations
primarily relate to requirements for removing portions of those plants at the end of the plant life
or lease term.

Some of APS’ transmission and distribution assets have asset retirement obligations because
they are subject to right of way and easement agreements that require final removal. These
agreements have a history of uninterrupted renewal that APS expects to continue. As a result, APS
cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the asset retirement obligation related to such
distribution and transmission assets.

Additionally, APS has aquifer protection permits for some of its generation sites that require
the closure of certain facilities at those sites. The generation sites are strategically located
to serve APS Native Load customers. The asset retirement obligations associated with our
non-regulated assets are immaterial.

The following schedule shows the change in our asset retirement obligations for 2009 and 2008
(dollars in millions):

In accordance with regulatory accounting, APS accrues removal costs for its regulated utility
assets, even if there is no legal obligation for removal. See detail of regulatory liabilities in
Note 1.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To fund the costs APS expects to incur to decommission Palo Verde, APS established external
decommissioning trusts in accordance with NRC regulations. Third-party investment managers are
authorized to buy and sell securities per their stated investment guidelines. The trust funds are
invested in a tax efficient manner in fixed income securities and domestic equity securities. APS
classifies investments in decommissioning trust funds as available for sale. As a result, we
record the decommissioning trust funds at their fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Because of the ability of APS to recover decommissioning costs in rates and in accordance with the
regulatory treatment for decommissioning trust funds, we have recorded the offsetting amount of
gains or losses on investment securities in other regulatory liabilities or assets

.

14. Fair Value Measurements

We disclose the fair value of certain assets and liabilities according to a fair value
hierarchy. This hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the inputs used to determine fair
values, which are then classified and disclosed in one of three categories. The three levels of
the fair value hierarchy are:

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Active
markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient
frequency and volume to provide information on an ongoing basis. This category includes
derivative instruments that are exchange-traded such as futures, cash equivalents invested
in exchange-traded money market funds, exchange-traded equities, and nuclear decommissioning
trust investments in Treasury securities.

Level 2 — Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable.
Derivative instruments in this category include nonexchange-traded contracts such as
forwards, options, and swaps. This category also includes investments, in common and
commingled funds that are redeemable and valued based on the funds’ net asset values. We
consider broker quotes observable inputs when the quote is binding on the broker, we can
validate the quote with market transactions, or we can determine that the inputs the broker
used to arrive at the quoted price are observable.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Level 3 — Model-derived valuations with unobservable inputs that are supported by little or
no market activity. Instruments in this category include long-dated derivative transactions
where models are required due to the length of the transaction, options, transactions in
locations where observable market data does not exist, and common and collective trusts with
significant restrictions on our ability to transact in the fund. The valuation models we
employ utilize spot prices, forward prices, historical market data and other factors to
forecast future prices. The primary valuation technique we use to calculate the fair value
of contracts where price quotes are not available is based on the extrapolation of forward
pricing curves using observable market data for more liquid delivery points in the same
region and actual transactions at the more illiquid delivery points.

Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input
that is significant to the fair value measurement. We maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs. If market data is not readily available, inputs may
reflect our own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use. Our assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect
the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value
hierarchy levels. Thus, a valuation may be classified in Level 3 even though the valuation may
include significant inputs that are readily observable. We assess whether a market is active by
obtaining observable broker quotes, reviewing actual market transactions, and assessing the volume
of transactions.

For non-exchange traded contracts, we calculate fair market value based on the average of the
bid and offer price, discounted to reflect net present value. We maintain certain valuation
adjustments for a number of risks associated with the valuation of future commitments. These
include valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risks based on the financial condition of
counterparties. The liquidity valuation adjustment represents the cost that would be incurred if
all unmatched positions were closed-out or hedged.

The credit valuation adjustment represents estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to
counterparties, taking into account netting arrangements, expected default experience for the
credit rating of the counterparties and the overall diversification of the portfolio.
Counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of major energy companies, municipalities,
local distribution companies and financial institutions. We maintain credit policies that
management believes minimize overall credit risk. Determination of the credit quality of
counterparties is based upon a number of factors, including credit ratings, financial condition,
project economics and collateral requirements. When applicable, we employ standardized agreements
that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single
counterparty.

We apply recurring fair value measurements to derivative instruments, nuclear decommissioning
trusts, certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans
(see Note 8). We may be required to record other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
These nonrecurring fair value measurements typically involve write-downs of individual assets due
to impairment.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Some of our derivative instrument transactions are valued based on unobservable inputs due to
the long-term nature of contracts or the unique location of the transactions. Our long-dated
energy transactions consist of observable valuations for the near term portion and unobservable
valuations for the long-term portions of the transaction. When the unobservable portion is
significant to the overall valuation of the transaction, the entire transaction is classified as
Level 3. Our classification of instruments as Level 3 is primarily reflective of the long-term
nature of our energy transactions, and is not reflective of material inactive markets.

The nuclear decommissioning trust invests in fixed income securities directly and equity
securities indirectly through commingled funds. The commingled equity funds are valued based on
the fund’s net asset value (“NAV”) and are classified within Level 2. We may transact in the fund
on a semi-monthly basis. Our trustee provides valuation of our nuclear decommissioning trust
assets by using pricing services to determine fair market value. We assess these valuations and
verify that pricing can be supported by actual recent market transactions. The trust fund
investments have been established to satisfy APS’ nuclear decommissioning obligations (see Note
12).

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We adopted guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures, for our nonfinancial assets
and liabilities on January 1, 2009, and it did not have a material impact on our financial
statements. We apply nonrecurring fair value measurements to certain real estate assets. These
adjustments to fair value are the result of write-downs of individual assets due to impairment.
Certain of our real estate assets have been impaired due to the distressed real estate market. We
determine fair value for our real estate assets primarily based on the future cash flows that we
estimate will be generated by each asset discounted for market risk. These fair value
determinations require significant judgment regarding key assumptions. Due to these unobservable
inputs, the valuation of real estate assets are considered Level 3 measurements.

As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of our impaired real estate assets that are measured
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis was $46 million, all of which was valued using significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3). Total impairment charges included in net income for the year ended
December 31, 2009 were approximately $280 million (including net loss attributable to
noncontrolling interests of $14 million before income taxes). Total impairment charges for the
year ended December 31, 2008 were approximately $53 million. See Note 23 for additional
information.

and 100,834,871 shares in 2007.

Options to purchase 572,301 shares of common stock at December 31, 2009
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise
prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares. Options to purchase shares
of common stock that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share were
687,375 at December 31, 2008 and 114,213 at December 31, 2007.

16. Stock-Based Compensation

We have a 2007 long-term incentive plan (“2007 Plan”) that allows the Company to grant
restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, stock grants, incentive and stock
options, stock appreciation rights, performance share units, performance cash awards, dividend
equivalents and stock to eligible individuals.

Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Stock Grants

Stock grants were issued to non-officer members of the Board of Directors in 2009, 2008 and
2007 under the 2007 Plan and were paid in fully transferable shares of stock. Restricted stock unit awards were
granted to officers and key employees in 2009, 2008 and 2007 under the 2007 Plan. Officers and key
employees elected to receive payment in either cash or in fully transferable shares of stock, in
exchange for each restricted stock unit on pre-established valuation
dates. Each restricted stock unit payable in cash represents the
right to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of one share of Pinnacle West’s
common stock. Restricted stock unit awards vest and
settle in annual installments over a four-year period. In addition, officers and key
employees will receive a cash payment equal to the amount of dividends that they would have
received if they had owned the stock to which the restricted stock units relate from the date of
grant to the date of payment plus interest. For any employee that was eligible to retire before
the settlement date, the employee’s restricted stock unit awards vest by retirement date and the
compensation expense is recognized by retirement eligibility. As the restricted stock unit award
is accounted for as a liability award, compensation costs, initially measured based on the
Company’s stock price on the grant date, are remeasured at each balance sheet date, using Pinnacle
West’s closing stock price.

Restricted stock unit awards were granted to a selected set of key employees of Pinnacle West
on October 21, 2008, February 18, 2009, March 18, 2009, April 13, 2009 and July 29, 2009 under the 2007 Plan. The
award of the restricted stock unit awards follows the same vesting schedule as the 2007 and 2008
restricted stock unit awards.

weighted average fair value for the three years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007:

settle the payment for the 2008 grant on February 20, 2009 was $1.3 million.

Performance Share Awards

Performance share awards were granted to officers and key employees in 2009 and 2008 under the
2007 Plan. Performance share awards for 2008 contain performance criteria that affect the number
of shares ultimately received. Generally, each recipient of performance shares is entitled to
receive shares of common stock after the end of a three-year performance period. The number of
shares each recipient ultimately receives, if any, is based upon the percentile ranking of Pinnacle
West’s earnings per share growth rate at the end of the three-year period as compared with the
earnings per share growth rate of all relevant companies in a specified utilities index.
Performance share awards for 2009 also contain performance criteria that affect the number of
shares that ultimately vest, 50% of the award is based on the same percentile ranking as the 2008
award and the other 50% of the award is based on six separate performance metrics. For any
employee that was eligible to retire before the settlement date, the employee’s performance share
awards vest by retirement date and the compensation expense is recognized by retirement
eligibility. As the performance share award is accounted for as a liability award, compensation
costs, initially measured based on the Company’s stock price on the grant date, are remeasured at
each balance sheet date, using Pinnacle West’s closing stock price. Management also evaluates the
probability of meeting the performance criteria at each balance sheet date and related compensation
cost is amortized over the performance period on a straight-line basis. If the goals are not
achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is
reversed.

Performance shares were granted to officers and key employees of Pinnacle West on October 21,
2008, February 18, 2009, March 18, 2009, April 13, 2009 and July 29, 2009 under the 2007 Plan.
This award of performance shares follows the same vesting schedule as the prior performance shares
awarded.

Retention Units

Retention unit awards were granted to key employees in 2006 and 2007. Each retention unit
award represents the right to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of one share of
Pinnacle West’s common stock, determined on pre-established valuation dates. Each retention unit
award vests and settles in equal annual installments over a four-year period. In addition, the
employee will receive a cash payment equal to the amount of dividends that the employee would have
received if the employee had owned the stock from the date of grant to the date of payment plus
interest. The retention unit awards have fully vested and settled on January 4, 2010; for any
employee that was eligible to retire before that date, the employee’s retention units vested by
retirement date and the compensation expense was recognized by retirement eligibility. As this
award is accounted for as a liability award, compensation costs, initially measured based on the
Company’s stock price on the grant date, were remeasured at each balance sheet date, using Pinnacle
West’s closing stock price.

The amount of cash to settle the payment on the first business day of 2009 was $1.1 million,
2008 was $1.3 million and 2007 was $1.6 million.

Incentive Shares

On January 21, 2009, the Human Resources Committee approved under the 2007 Plan payment of
2008 incentive awards to officers in the form of a Pinnacle West common stock grant. A total of 138,756
shares were issued for this stock grant with a grant date fair value of $32.58 per share. The
stock grant was included in stock compensation expense in 2008.

Stock Options

We have issued stock options in the past, but have not granted stock options since 2004. The
term of outstanding options cannot be longer than 10 years and options cannot be repriced during
their terms.

Cash received from options exercised under our share-based payment arrangements was $3 million
for 2009, zero for 2008 and $8 million for 2007. The tax benefit realized for the tax deductions
from option exercises of the share-based payment arrangements were immaterial for 2009, zero for
2008 and $1 million for 2007.

The intrinsic value of options exercised was immaterial for 2009, zero for 2008 and $2 million
for 2007.

As of December 31, 2009, there was $12 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related
to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans. That cost is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years. The total fair value of shares
vested during 2009 was $10 million, 2008 was $5 million and $6 million for 2007.

We have reserved 8 million shares of common stock for issuance under the 2007 Plan. Under the
2007 Plan, any shares of stock that are potentially deliverable under the 2002 long term incentive
plan will be added to the number of shares available for grant under the 2007 Plan if the award is
cancelled, forfeited, or terminated such that those shares are returned to the Company.

The compensation cost that has been charged against Pinnacle West’s income for share-based
compensation plans was $5 million in 2009, $8 million in 2008 and $6 million in 2007. The
compensation cost that Pinnacle West has capitalized was immaterial in 2009, 2008 and 2007.
Pinnacle West’s total income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for
share-based compensation arrangements was $2 million in 2009, $3 million in 2008 and $2 million in
2007. APS’ share of compensation cost that has been charged against income was $4 million in 2009,
$7 million in 2008 and $6 million in 2007.

Pinnacle West’s current policy is to issue new shares to satisfy share requirements for stock
compensation plans and it does not expect to repurchase any shares except to satisfy tax
withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock during 2010.

Due to the current and anticipated continuing distressed conditions in the real
estate and credit markets, in 2009 our real estate subsidiary, SunCor, began disposing
of its homebuilding operations, master-planned communities, land parcels, commercial
assets and golf courses in order to reduce its outstanding debt (see Note 23). As a
part of this plan to sell substantially all of SunCor’s assets, the real estate segment
may no longer be a reporting segment in the future.

(b)

All other activities relate to APSES, Silverhawk and El Dorado. Income from
discontinued operations for 2008 is primarily related to the resolution of certain tax
issues associated with the sale of Silverhawk in 2005. None of these segments is a
reportable segment.

18. Derivative Accounting

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation
costs of electricity, natural gas, coal, emissions allowances and in interest rates. We manage
risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various derivative instruments,
including futures, forwards, options and swaps. As part of our overall risk management program, we
may use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity, fuels, and emissions
allowances and credits. Derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are used to
limit our exposure to cash flow variability on forecasted transactions. The changes in market
value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged transactions. We may
also invest in derivative instruments for trading purposes; however, for the year ended December
31, 2009, there was no material trading activity.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value; see Note 14 for a discussion of
fair value measurements. Derivative instruments for the physical delivery of purchase and sale
quantities transacted in the normal course of business qualify for the normal purchase and sales
scope exception and are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting. Due to the scope
exception, these derivative instruments are excluded from our derivative instrument discussion and
disclosures below.

We enter into derivative instruments for economic hedging purposes. While we believe the
economic hedges mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, some of these instruments
may not meet the specific hedge accounting requirements and are not designated as accounting
hedges. Economic hedges not designated as accounting hedges are recorded at fair value on our
balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of income as incurred. These
instruments are included in the “non-designated hedges” discussion and disclosure below.

Hedge effectiveness is the degree to which the derivative instrument contract and the hedged
item are correlated and is measured based on the relative changes in fair value between the
derivative instrument contract and the hedged item over time. We assess hedge effectiveness both
at inception and on a continuing basis. These assessments exclude the time value of certain
options. For accounting hedges that are deemed an effective hedge, the effective portion of the
gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings. We recognize in current earnings the gains and losses
representing hedge ineffectiveness, and the gains and losses on any hedge components which are
excluded from our effectiveness assessment. As of December 31, 2009, we hedged the majority of
certain exposures to the price variability of commodities for a maximum of 39 months.

In the electricity business, some contracts to purchase energy are netted against other
contracts to sell energy. This is called “book-out” and usually occurs in contracts that have the
same terms (quantities and delivery points) and for which power does not flow. We net these
book-outs, which reduces both revenues and fuel and purchased power costs in our Consolidated
Statements of Income, but this does not impact our financial condition, net income or cash flows.

For its regulated operations, APS defers for future rate treatment approximately 90% of
unrealized gains and losses on certain derivatives pursuant to the PSA mechanism that would

will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income as an offset to the effect of
market price changes for the related hedged transactions. In accordance with the PSA, certain of
these amounts will be recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability and have no effect on
earnings.

Credit Risk and Credit Related Contingent Features

We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties. We
have risk management contracts with many counterparties, including one counterparty for which our
exposure represents approximately 31% of Pinnacle West’s $79 million of risk management assets as
of December 31, 2009. This exposure relates to a long-term traditional wholesale contract with a
counterparty that has very high credit quality. Our risk management process assesses and monitors
the financial exposure of all counterparties. Despite the fact that the great majority of trading
counterparties’ debt is rated as investment grade by the credit rating agencies, there is still a
possibility that one or more of these companies could default, resulting in a material impact on
consolidated earnings for a given period. Counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of
financial institutions, major energy companies, municipalities and local distribution companies.
We maintain credit policies that we believe minimize overall credit risk to within acceptable
limits. Determination of the credit quality of our counterparties is based upon a number of
factors, including credit ratings and our evaluation of their financial condition. To manage
credit risk, we employ collateral requirements and standardized agreements that allow for the
netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. Valuation
adjustments are established representing our estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to
counterparties.



PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Certain of our derivative instrument contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent
features including, among other things, investment grade credit rating provisions, credit-related
cross default provisions, and adequate assurance provisions. Adequate assurance provisions allow a
counterparty with reasonable grounds for uncertainty to demand additional collateral based on
subjective events and/or conditions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on December 31, 2009 was
$283 million, for which we had posted collateral of $92 million in the normal course of business.

For those derivative instruments in a net liability position, with investment grade credit
contingencies, the counterparties could demand additional collateral if our debt credit rating were
to fall below investment grade (below BBB- for Standard & Poor’s or Fitch or Baa3 for Moody’s),
which would be a violation of the credit rating provisions. If the investment grade contingent
features underlying these agreements had been triggered on December 31, 2009, after off-setting
asset positions under master netting arrangements we would have been required to post approximately
an additional $100 million of collateral to our counterparties; this amount includes those
contracts which qualify for scope exceptions, which are excluded from the derivative details in the
above footnote. We also have energy related non-derivative instrument contracts with investment
grade credit-related contingent features which could also require us to post additional collateral
of approximately $200 million if our debt credit ratings were to fall below investment grade.

20. Variable-Interest Entities

See Note 2 for a discussion of the amended accounting guidance relating to VIEs adopted on
January 1, 2010. Our December 31, 2009 financial statements and the following disclosure do not
reflect the adoption of this new guidance.

In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate VIE lessors in order to sell and
lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2. The leases are accounted for as operating leases. We
are not the primary beneficiary of the Palo Verde VIEs and, accordingly, do not consolidate them
(see Note 9).

APS is exposed to losses under the Palo Verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of
certain events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur. Under certain
circumstances (for example, the NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde
or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to assume the debt associated
with the transactions, make specified payments to the equity participants, and take title to the
leased Unit 2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written down in value. If
such an event had occurred as of December 31, 2009, APS would have been required to assume
approximately $152 million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately $153 million.

We have certain long-term purchase power agreements where we purchase substantially all of an
entity’s output from a specified facility for a specified period. We have evaluated these
arrangements under the variable interest accounting guidance and have determined that these
agreements do not represent variable interests. If these agreements had been deemed variable
interests in these entities, we would not be considered the primary beneficiary of these entities
and therefore would not consolidate the entities.

SunCor is the primary beneficiary of certain land development arrangements and, accordingly,
consolidates the variable interest entities. The assets and non-controlling interests reflected in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these arrangements were approximately $29 million at
December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.

21. Guarantees

We have issued parental guarantees and letters of credit and obtained surety bonds on behalf
of our subsidiaries.

Our parental guarantees for APS relate to commodity energy products. In addition, Pinnacle
West has obtained approximately $8 million of surety bonds related to APS’ operations, which
primarily relate to self-insured workers’ compensation. Our credit support instruments enable
APSES to offer energy-related products. Non-performance or non-payment under the original contract
by our subsidiaries would require us to perform under the guarantee or surety bond. No liability
is currently recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to Pinnacle West’s current
outstanding guarantees on behalf of our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009, we had no guarantees
that were in default. Our guarantees have no recourse or collateral provisions to allow us to
recover amounts paid under the guarantees. The amounts and approximate terms of our guarantees and
surety bonds for each subsidiary at December 31, 2009 are as follows (dollars in millions):

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APS has entered into various agreements that require letters of credit for financial assurance
purposes. At December 31, 2009, approximately $227 million of letters of credit were outstanding
to support existing pollution control bonds of approximately $224 million. The letters of credit
are available to fund the payment of principal and interest of such debt obligations and expire in
2010. APS has also entered into approximately $70 million of letters of credit to support certain
equity lessors in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions (see Notes 9 and 20 for further
details on the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions). These letters of credit expire in 2010.
APS intends to provide from either existing or new facilities for the extension, renewal or
substitution of the letters of credit to the extent required.

We enter into agreements that include indemnification provisions relating to liabilities
arising from or related to certain of our agreements; most significantly, APS has agreed to
indemnify the equity participants and other parties in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions
with respect to certain tax matters. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in
the indemnification provisions and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under
such indemnification provisions cannot be reasonably estimated. Based on historical experience and
evaluation of the specific indemnities, we do not believe that any material loss related to such
indemnification provisions is likely.

22. Discontinued Operations

SunCor

(real estate segment)

—

In 2007, 2008 and 2009, SunCor sold properties that are
required to be reported as discontinued operations on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of
Income. Prior year income statement amounts related to these properties were reclassified from
operations to discontinued operations. The asset sales resulted in no gain for 2009, a $24 million
after tax gain in 2008 and a $10 million after tax gain in 2007. In addition, see Note 23 — Real
Estate Impairment Charge.

23. Real Estate Impairment Charge

During the first quarter of 2009, SunCor undertook and completed a review of its assets and
strategies within its various markets as a result of the then current and anticipated continuing
distressed conditions in real estate and credit markets. Based on the results of the review, on
March 27, 2009, SunCor’s Board of Directors authorized a series of strategic transactions to
dispose of SunCor’s homebuilding operations, master-planned communities, land parcels, commercial
assets and golf courses in order to reduce SunCor’s outstanding debt. During 2009 we recorded
impairment charges of approximately $266 million pre-tax and $161 million after income taxes. Of
the total $266 million impairment charge for 2009, approximately $244 million related to held and
used assets as of December 31, 2009, and $22 million is included in discontinued operations and is
related to assets sold during 2009. We believe that most of the assets to be sold, which are
classified as “Real Estate Investments — Net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, do not meet the
held for sale and discontinued operations criteria as of December 31, 2009 because of the
uncertainties related to the current market conditions and obtaining necessary approvals, we cannot
assert that a sale of these properties within the upcoming year is probable. We recorded pre-tax
impairment charges in 2008 of approximately $53 million or $32 million after income taxes. The
detail of the impairment charge is as follows (dollars in millions, and before income taxes):

Land parcels and commercial assets

We estimate the fair value of our real estate assets primarily based on either the future cash
flows that we estimate will be generated by each asset discounted at a rate we believe market
participants would use, on independent appraisals, or other market information, including
comparison to comparable properties. Our impairment assessments and fair value determinations
require significant judgment regarding key assumptions such as future sales prices, future
construction and land development costs, future sales timing, and discount rates. The assumptions
are specific to each project and may vary among projects. The weighted average discount rates we
used to estimate fair values during 2009 ranged from 11% to 29%. Due to the judgment and
assumptions applied in the estimation process, with regard to impairments, it is possible that
actual results could differ from those estimates.

SunCor also recorded in 2009 $8 million of pretax severance and other charges relating to
these actions. Pinnacle West does not expect that any of the impairment charges will result in
future cash expenditures, other than immaterial disposition costs.

See Notes 5 and 6 for a discussion of SunCor’s debt and liquidity matters, and the impact of
impairment charges on the SunCor Secured Revolver.



MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

(ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY)

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f), for Arizona Public
Service Company. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation
under the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework,

our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009. The effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
which is included herein and also relates to the Company’s financial statements.

February
19, 2010



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of

Arizona Public Service Company

Phoenix, Arizona

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Arizona Public Service Company (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related statements of income, changes in common stock
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. We also have
audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2009 and 2008and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

S-1. Income Taxes

APS is included in Pinnacle West’s consolidated tax return. However, when Pinnacle West
allocates income taxes to APS, it is done based upon APS’ taxable income computed on a stand-alone
basis, in accordance with the tax sharing agreement.

Certain assets and liabilities are reported differently for income tax purposes than they are
for financial statements purposes. The tax effect of these differences is recorded as deferred
taxes. We calculate deferred taxes using the current income tax rates.

APS has recorded a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability related to income taxes on its
Balance Sheets in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated operations. The regulatory
asset is for certain temporary differences, primarily the allowance for equity funds used during
construction. The regulatory liability relates to deferred taxes resulting primarily from pension
and other postretirement benefits. APS amortizes these amounts as the differences reverse.

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits,
excluding interest and penalties, at the beginning and end of the period that are included in
accrued taxes and unrecognized tax benefits on the Balance Sheets (dollars in thousands):

)

(97,079

)

Total unrecognized tax benefits, December 31

$

199,887

$

62,409

Included in both balances of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were
approximately $15 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would decrease our effective tax
rate.

As of the balance sheet date, the tax year ended December 31, 2005 and all subsequent tax
years remain subject to examination by the IRS. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to
state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 1999.

Within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the Company will reach a settlement
with the IRS with regard to the examination of tax returns for years ended December 31,
2005 through 2007. As a result of these anticipated settlements, and the expiration of certain
statutes of limitations, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax
benefits could be reduced by an amount up to $70 million.

We reflect interest and penalties, if any, on unrecognized tax benefits in the statement of
income as income tax expense. The amount of interest recognized in the Statement of Income related
to unrecognized tax benefits was a pre-tax expense of $2 million for 2009 and a pre-tax benefit of
$51 million for 2008.



ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The total amount of accrued liabilities for interest recognized in the Balance Sheets related
to unrecognized tax benefits was $8 million as of December 31, 2009 and $5 million as of December
31, 2008. To the extent that matters are settled favorably, this amount could reverse and decrease
our effective tax rate. Additionally, as of December 31, 2009, we have recognized $1 million of
interest expense to be paid on the underpayment of income taxes for certain adjustments that we
have filed, or will file, with the IRS.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS

ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term “disclosure controls and procedures” means controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) (15 U.S.C.
78a

et seq

.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a
company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Pinnacle West’s management, with the participation of Pinnacle West’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of Pinnacle West’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2009. Based on that evaluation, Pinnacle West’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of that date, Pinnacle West’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

APS’ management, with the participation of APS’ Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of APS’ disclosure controls and procedures as of December
31, 2009. Based on that evaluation, APS’ Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that, as of that date, APS’ disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

(b) Management’s Annual Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Reference is made to “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
(Pinnacle West Capital Corporation)” on page 81 of this report and “Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (Arizona Public Service
Company)” on page 150 of this
report.

(c) Attestation Reports of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

Reference
is made to “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm” on page 82 of this report and “Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm” on page 151 of this
report on the internal control over financial reporting of Pinnacle West and APS, respectively.

(d) Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The term “internal control over financial reporting” (defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(f)) refers to
the process of a company that is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP.



No change in Pinnacle West’s or APS’ internal control over financial reporting occurred during
the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2009 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, Pinnacle West’s or APS’ internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

None.

PART III

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF PINNACLE WEST

Reference is hereby made to “Information About Our Board and Corporate Governance,”
“Proposal 1 — Election of Directors” and to “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting
Compliance” in the Pinnacle West Proxy Statement relating to the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to
be held on May 19, 2010 (the “2010 Proxy Statement”) and to the “Executive
Officers of Pinnacle West” section in Part I of this report.

Pinnacle West has adopted a Code of Ethics for Financial Executives that applies to financial
executives including Pinnacle West’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief
Accounting Officer, Controller, Treasurer, and persons holding substantially equivalent positions
at Pinnacle West’s subsidiaries. The Code of Ethics for Financial Executives is posted on Pinnacle
West’s website at

. Pinnacle West intends to satisfy the requirements under
Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding disclosure of amendments to, or waivers from, provisions of the
Code of Ethics for Financial Executives by posting such information on Pinnacle West’s website.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Reference
is hereby made to “Director Compensation,” “Report of
the Human Resources Committee,”  “Executive

“HR Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation” in the 2010
Proxy Statement.

6,436,058


This amount includes shares subject to outstanding options as well as shares subject
to outstanding performance share awards and restricted stock unit awards at the maximum amount of
shares issuable under such awards. However, payout of the performance share awards is contingent
on the Company reaching certain levels of performance during a three-year performance period. If
the performance criteria for these awards are not fully satisfied, the award recipient will receive
less than the maximum number of shares available under these grants and may receive nothing from
these grants.


The weighted average exercise price in this column does not take performance share
awards or restricted stock unit awards into account, as those awards have no exercise price.


Awards can take the form of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance shares, performance share units, performance cash, stock grants, dividend equivalents,
and restricted stock units.

Equity Compensation Plans Approved By Security Holders

Amounts in column (a) in the table above include shares subject to awards outstanding under
three equity compensation plans that were approved by our shareholders: (a) the Pinnacle West
Capital Corporation 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan, under which no new stock awards may be granted;
(b) the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2002 Plan”), under
which no new stock awards may be granted; and (c) the Pinnacle West Capital
Corporation 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”), which was approved by our shareholders
at our 2007 annual meeting of shareholders. Although we cannot issue additional awards under the
2002 Plan, shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2002 Plan that expire or are cancelled or
terminated will be available for issuance under the 2007 Plan. See Note 16 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these plans.



Equity Compensation Plans Not Approved By Security Holders

The Company does not have any equity compensation plans under which shares can still be issued
that have not been approved by shareholders.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND

DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
