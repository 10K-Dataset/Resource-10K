PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

CURRENT STATUS

General

We were incorporated in 1985 under the laws of the State of Arizona and
own all of the outstanding equity securities of APS, our major subsidiary. APS
is a vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or
wholesale electric service to substantially all of the state of Arizona, with
the major exceptions of the Tucson metropolitan area and about one-half of the
Phoenix metropolitan area. Through its marketing and trading division, APS
also generates, sells and delivers electricity to wholesale customers in the
western United States.

Our other significant subsidiaries are Pinnacle West Energy, which owns
and operates generating plants; APS Energy Services, which provides competitive
energy services and products in the western United States; and SunCor, which is
engaged in real estate development activities. We discuss each of these
subsidiaries in greater detail below. See “Business of Pinnacle West Energy
Corporation,” “Business of APS Energy Services Company, Inc.” and “Business of
SunCor Development Company” in this Item 1.

Business Segments

We have three principal business segments (determined by products,
services and the regulatory environment):

•

our regulated electricity segment (70% of operating revenues
in 2003), which consists of traditional regulated retail and
wholesale electricity businesses and related activities, and
includes electricity generation, transmission and distribution;

•

our marketing and trading segment (14% of operating revenues
in 2003), which consists of our competitive energy business
activities, including wholesale marketing and trading and APS Energy
Services’ commodity-related energy services; and

•

our real estate segment (13% of operating revenues in 2003),
which consists of SunCor’s real estate development and investment
activities.

See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for
financial information about our business segments.

APS General Rate Case

We believe APS’ general rate case pending before the ACC is the key issue
affecting our outlook. As discussed in greater detail in Note 3 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, in this rate case APS has
requested, among other things, a 9.8% retail rate increase (approximately $175
million annually), rate treatment for the PWEC Dedicated Assets and the
recovery of $234 million written off by APS as part of the 1999 Settlement
Agreement. In its filed


testimony, the ACC staff recommended, among other things, that the ACC
decrease APS’ rates by approximately 8% (approximately $143 million annually),
not allow the PWEC Dedicated Assets to be included in APS’ rate base, and not
allow APS to recover any of the $234 million written off as a result of the
1999 Settlement Agreement. The ACC staff recommendations, if implemented as
proposed, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations,
financial position, liquidity, dividend sustainability, credit ratings and
access to capital markets. We believe that APS’ rate case requests are
supported by, among other things, APS’ demonstrated need for the PWEC Dedicated
Assets; APS’ need to attract capital at reasonable rates of return to support
the required capital investment to ensure continued customer reliability in
APS’ high-growth service territory; and the conditions in the western energy
market. As a result, we believe it is unlikely that the ACC would adopt the
ACC staff recommendations in their present form, although we can give no
assurances in that regard. The hearing on the rate case is scheduled to begin
on May 25, 2004. We believe the ACC will be able to make a decision by the end
of 2004.

Employees

At December 31, 2003, we employed about 7,200 people, including the
employees of our subsidiaries. Of these employees, about 6,000 were employees
of APS, including employees at jointly-owned generating facilities for which
APS serves as the generating facility manager. About 1,200 people were
employed by Pinnacle West and our other subsidiaries. Our principal executive
offices are located at 400 North Fifth Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85004
(telephone 602-250-1000).

Available Information

We make available free of charge on or through our Internet Website
(www.pinnaclewest.com) the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable
after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC: our Annual
Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on
Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section
13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The information on our
Website is not part of this report.

Forward-Looking Statements

This document contains forward-looking statements based on current
expectations, and we assume no obligation to update these statements or make
any further statements on any of these issues, except as required by applicable
law. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as
“predict,” “hope,” “may,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “require,”
“intend,” “assume” and similar words. Because actual results may differ
materially from expectations, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on
these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ
materially from historical results, or from results or outcomes currently
expected or sought by us. These factors include, but are not limited to:

•

state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and
actions, including the outcome of the rate case APS filed with the
ACC on June 27, 2003 and the wholesale electric price mitigation
plan adopted by the FERC;

•

the outcome of regulatory, legislative and judicial
proceedings relating to the restructuring;


REGULATION AND COMPETITION

Retail

The ACC regulates APS’ retail electric rates and its issuance of
securities. The ACC must also approve any transfer of APS’ property used to
provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of
certain transactions between Pinnacle West, APS and their respective
affiliates. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
for a discussion of the status of electric industry restructuring in Arizona.

The electric utility industry has undergone significant regulatory change
in the last few years designed to encourage competition in the sale of
electricity and related services. However, the experience in California with
deregulation has caused many states, including Arizona, to
reexamine retail electric competition.


As of January 1, 2001, all of APS’ retail customers were eligible to
choose an alternate energy supplier. However, there are currently no active
retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to APS’
customers. As a result, we cannot predict when, and the extent to which,
additional competitors will re-enter APS’ service territory. Also, regulatory
developments and legal challenges to the ACC’s electric competition rules have
raised considerable uncertainty about the status and pace of retail electric
competition and of electric restructuring in Arizona. See “Retail Electric
Competition Rules” in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 for additional information.

APS is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investor-owned
utilities in Arizona (such as Tucson Electric Power Company and Southwest Gas
Corporation) as well as cooperatives, municipalities, electrical districts and
similar types of governmental or non-profit organizations (principally Salt
River Project). APS also faces competition from low-cost, hydroelectric power
and parties that have access to low-priced preferential, federal power and
other governmental subsidies. In addition, some customers, particularly
industrial and large commercial customers, may own and operate generation
facilities to meet their own energy requirements.

Wholesale

General

The FERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission
services. During 2003, approximately 19% of our electric operating revenues
resulted from such sales and services. In early 2003, we moved our marketing
and trading division from Pinnacle West to APS for all future marketing and
trading activities (existing wholesale contracts remained at Pinnacle West) as
a result of the ACC’s Track A Order prohibiting the previously required
transfer of APS’ generating assets to Pinnacle West Energy (see “Track A Order”
in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8).

The marketing and trading division focuses primarily on managing APS’
purchased power and fuel risks in connection with its costs of serving retail
customer energy requirements. The division also sells, in the wholesale
market, APS and Pinnacle West Energy generation output that is not needed for
APS’ Native Load and, in doing so, competes with other utilities, power
marketers and independent power producers. See “Track B Order” in Note 3 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information regarding
an ACC-mandated process by which APS must competitively procure energy.
Additionally, the marketing and trading division, subject to specified
parameters, markets, hedges and trades in electricity, fuels and emissions
allowances and credits.

Regional Transmission Organizations

Federal

In a December 1999 order, the FERC established characteristics
and functions that must be met by utilities in forming and operating RTOs. The
characteristics for an acceptable RTO include independence from market
participants, operational control over a region large enough to support
efficient and nondiscriminatory markets and exclusive authority to maintain
short-term reliability. Additionally, in a pending notice of proposed
rulemaking, the FERC is considering implementing a standard market design for
wholesale markets.


On October 16, 2001, APS and other owners of electric transmission lines
in the Southwest filed with the FERC a request for a declaratory order
confirming that their proposal to form WestConnect RTO, LLC would satisfy the
FERC’s requirements for the formation of an RTO. On October 10, 2002, the FERC
issued an order finding that the WestConnect proposal, if modified to address
specified issues, could meet the FERC’s RTO requirements and provide the basic
framework for a standard market design for the Southwest. On September 15,
2003, the FERC issued an order granting clarification and rehearing, in part,
of its prior orders. In particular, this order approved the use of a physical
congestion management scheme, which is used to allocate transmission rights on
congested lines, for WestConnect for an initial phase-in period. The FERC
indicated that the WestConnect utilities and the appropriate regional state
advisory committee should develop a market-based congestion management scheme
for subsequent implementation. APS is now participating in a cost/benefit
analysis of implementing WestConnect, the results of which are expected to be
completed in 2004.

State

The Rules also required the formation and implementation of an
Arizona Independent Scheduling Administrator. The purpose of the AISA is to
oversee the application of operating protocols to ensure statewide consistency
for transmission access. The AISA is anticipated to be a temporary
organization until the implementation of an independent system operator or RTO.
APS participated in the creation of the AISA, a not-for-profit entity, and the
filing at the FERC for approval of its operating protocols. The operating
protocols were partially rejected and the remainder are currently under review.
In its Track B Order, the ACC directed that a hearing be held on whether or
not APS should be required to continue funding the AISA.

BUSINESS OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

General

APS was incorporated in 1920 under the laws of Arizona and currently has
more than 931,500 customers. APS does not distribute any products. During
2003, no single purchaser or user of energy (other than Pinnacle West)
accounted for more than 4% of consolidated electric revenues. See “Current
Status – General” and “Regulation and Competition” above for additional
background information about APS’ business, including its marketing and trading
division.

At
December 31, 2003, APS employed approximately 6,000 people, including
employees at jointly-owned generating facilities for which APS serves as the
generating facility manager. APS’ principal executive offices are located at
400 North Fifth Street, P.O. Box 53999, Phoenix, Arizona 85072-3999 (telephone
602-250-1000).

Purchased Power and Generating Fuel

See “Properties – Capacity” in Item 2 for information about our power
plants by fuel types.

2003 Energy Mix

Our consolidated sources of energy during 2003 were: purchased power –
54.4% (approximately 90.0% of which was for wholesale power operations); coal –
20.1%; nuclear – 14.7%; gas – 10.7%; and other (includes oil, hydro and solar)
– 0.1%.


APS’
sources of energy during 2003 were: purchased power – 55.3%
(approximately 75.0% of which was for wholesale power operations); coal –
24.5%; nuclear – 17.9%; gas – 2.2%; and other (includes oil, hydro and solar) –
0.1%.

Coal Supply

Cholla

Cholla is a coal-fired power plant located in northeastern
Arizona. It is a jointly-owned facility operated by APS. APS purchases most
of Cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines all of the coal
under a long-term lease of coal reserves owned by the Navajo Nation, the
federal government and private landholders. Cholla has sufficient coal under
current contracts to ensure a reliable fuel supply through 2007. This includes
our expected requirements for low sulfur coal, which is required for limited
operating conditions; however, if necessary, low sulfur coal may be purchased
on the open market. APS may purchase a portion of Cholla’s coal requirements
on the spot market to take advantage of competitive pricing options. Following
expiration of current contracts, APS believes that numerous competitive fuel
supply options will exist to ensure the continued operation of Cholla for its
useful life.

Four Corners

Four Corners is a coal-fired power plant located in the
northwestern corner of New Mexico. It is a jointly-owned facility operated by
APS. APS purchases all of Four Corners’ coal requirements from a supplier with
a long-term lease of coal reserves owned by the Navajo Nation. The Four
Corners coal contract runs through July 2016, with options to extend the
contract for five to fifteen additional years beyond the plant site lease
expiration in 2017.

Navajo Generating Station

The Navajo Generating Station is a coal-fired
power plant located in northern Arizona. It is a jointly-owned facility
operated by Salt River Project. The Navajo Generating Station’s coal
requirements are purchased from a supplier with long-term leases from the
Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe. The Navajo Generating Station is under
contract with its coal supplier through 2011, with options to extend through
the plant site lease expiration in 2019. The Navajo Generating Station lease
waives certain taxes through the lease expiration in 2019. The lease provides
for the potential to renegotiate the coal royalty in 2007 and 2017 and a
five-year price review, each of which may impact the fuel price.

See “Properties – Capacity” in Item 2 for information about APS’ ownership
interests in Cholla, Four Corners and the Navajo Generating Station. See Note
11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information
regarding our coal mine reclamation obligations.

Natural Gas Supply

See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a
discussion of our natural gas requirements.

Nuclear Fuel Supply

Palo Verde Fuel Cycle

Palo Verde is a nuclear power plant located about
50 miles west of Phoenix, Arizona. It is a jointly-owned facility operated by
APS. The fuel cycle for Palo Verde is comprised of the following stages:

•

mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates;


The Palo Verde participants have contracted for all of Palo Verde’s
requirements for uranium concentrates and conversion services through 2008.
The Palo Verde participants have also contracted for all of Palo Verde’s
enrichment services through 2010 and fuel assembly fabrication services until
at least 2015.

Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal

See “Palo Verde Nuclear Generating
Station” in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for
a discussion of spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal.

Purchased Power Agreements

In addition to its own available generating capacity (see “Properties” in
Item 2), APS purchases electricity under various arrangements. One of the most
important of these is a long-term contract with Salt River Project. The amount
of electricity available to APS is based in large part on customer demand
within certain areas now served by APS pursuant to a related territorial
agreement. The generating capacity available to APS pursuant to the contract
was 343 MW from January through May 2003, and starting in June 2003, it changed
to 350 MW. In 2003, APS received approximately 952,146 MWh of energy under the
contract and paid about $64.4 million for capacity availability and energy
received. This contract may be canceled by Salt River Project on three years’
notice, given no earlier than December 31, 2003. To date, Salt River Project
has not given any notice to cancel. APS may also cancel the contract on five
years’ notice, given no earlier than December 31, 2006.

In September 1990, APS entered into a thirty-year seasonal capacity
exchange agreement with PacifiCorp. Under this agreement, APS receives
electricity from PacifiCorp during the summer peak season (from May 15 to
September 15) and APS returns electricity to PacifiCorp during the winter
season (from October 15 to February 15). Until 2020, APS and PacifiCorp each
has 480 MW of capacity and a related amount of energy available to it under the
agreement for its respective seasons. In 2003, APS received approximately
571,392 MWh of energy under the capacity exchange. APS must also make
additional offers of energy to PacifiCorp each year through October 31, 2020.
Pursuant to this requirement, during 2003, PacifiCorp received offers of
1,091,450 MWh and purchased about 168,000 MWh.

In December 2003, APS issued a request for proposals for the purchase of
at least 500 MW of long-term power supply resources for delivery beginning June
1, 2007 to be used for APS’ anticipated retail load. For additional
information, see “Request for Proposals” in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8.

Consistent with the ACC’s Track B Order, APS issued a request for
proposals (“RFP”) in March 2003 and, as a result of that RFP, on or before May
6, 2003, APS entered into contracts with three parties, including Pinnacle West
Energy, to meet a portion of APS’ capacity and energy requirements for the
years 2003 through 2006. See “Track B Order” in Note 3 of Notes to


Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information about
the contracts and the Track B Order.

Construction Program

During the years 2001 through 2003, APS incurred approximately $1.4
billion in capital expenditures. APS’ capital expenditures for the years 2004
through 2006 are expected to be primarily for expanding transmission and
distribution capabilities to meet growing customer needs, for upgrading
existing utility property and for environmental purposes. APS’ capital
expenditures were approximately $429 million in 2003. APS’ capital
expenditures, including expenditures for environmental control facilities, for
the years 2004 through 2006 have been estimated as follows:

Results of Operations – Capital Needs and Resources by Company” in Item 7 for
additional information about APS’ and Pinnacle West Energy’s construction
programs.

Environmental Matters

EPA Environmental Regulation

Regional Haze Rules

On April 22, 1999, the EPA announced final regional
haze rules. These new regulations require states to submit, by 2008,
implementation plans to eliminate all man-made emissions causing visibility
impairment in certain specified areas, including Class I Areas in the Colorado
Plateau, and to consider and potentially apply the best available retrofit
technology for major stationary sources.

The rules allow nine western states and tribes to follow an alternate
implementation plan and schedule for the Class I Areas. Five western states,
including Arizona, have submitted proposed State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to
the EPA to implement this alternative plan. If the EPA approves Arizona’s SIP,
APS does not anticipate any new emission reduction requirements for its Arizona
plants through 2013.

With respect to hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam
generating units, the EPA determined in 2000 that mercury emissions and other
hazardous air pollutants from coal and oil-fired power plants should be
regulated. The EPA recently proposed two alternatives to regulate mercury
emissions from these plants. Under the first alternative, the EPA would
promulgate a Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standard establishing
mercury emission limitations for coal- and oil-fired power plants, effective
2008. APS is currently assessing the need


for additional controls to meet this proposed alternative. Under the
second alternative, the EPA would rescind its 2000 finding requiring the
establishment of a MACT standard for such plants, and would instead establish a
two-phased mercury emissions trading program under the Clean Air Act’s new
source performance standards provisions. If this second alternative is
adopted, APS does not anticipate any emission reduction requirements under the
first phase of the program (from 2010 through 2018). Because the ultimate
requirements that the EPA may impose are not yet known, we cannot currently
estimate the capital expenditures, if any, which may be required.

Federal Implementation Plan

In September 1999, the EPA proposed a FIP to
set air quality standards at certain power plants, including the Navajo
Generating Station and Four Corners. The FIP is similar to current Arizona
regulation of the Navajo Generating Station and New Mexico regulation of Four
Corners, with minor modifications. APS does not currently expect the FIP to
have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations
or liquidity.

Superfund

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act (Superfund) establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous
substances found contaminating the soil, water or air. Those who generated,
transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are
among those who are PRPs. PRPs may be strictly, and often jointly and
severally, liable for clean-up. On September 3, 2003, the EPA advised APS that
the EPA considers APS to be a “potentially responsible party” in the Motorola

nd

Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 (OU3) in Phoenix, Arizona. APS has
facilities that are within this superfund site. The EPA has only recently
begun to study the OU3 site. Because the ultimate remediation requirements the
EPA may require are not yet known, we cannot currently estimate the
expenditures, if any, which may be required.

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

APS is currently investigating properties
which it now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate
predecessors, that were at one time sites of, or sites associated with,
manufactured gas plants. Where appropriate, APS conducts clean-up activities
for these sites. APS does not expect these matters to have a material adverse
effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Arizona Department of Environmental Quality

ADEQ issued two NOVs to APS in 2001 alleging, among other things, the
burning of unauthorized materials and storage of hazardous waste without a
permit at the Cholla Power Plant. APS, the Attorney General for the State of
Arizona and ADEQ have reached an agreement (in the form of a Consent Judgment)
to settle this matter. The Consent Judgment (No. CV2004-000731) was entered on
January 26, 2004, and on February 2, 2004, pursuant to its terms, APS paid a
$200,000 penalty to the State of Arizona.

ADEQ issued an NOV to APS in January 2004 alleging that, among other
things, the discharge limit for lead was exceeded at the Saguaro Power Plant.
APS is in the process of investigating this matter.

Navajo Nation Environmental Issues

Four Corners and the Navajo Generating Station are located on the Navajo
Reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as
well as leases from the Navajo Nation. APS is the Four Corners operating
agent. APS owns a 100% interest in Four Corners Units


1, 2 and 3, and a 15% interest in Four Corners Units 4 and 5. APS owns a
14% interest in Navajo Generating Station Units 1, 2 and 3.

In July 1995, the Navajo Nation enacted the Navajo Nation Air Pollution
Prevention and Control Act, the Navajo Nation Safe Drinking Water Act and the
Navajo Nation Pesticide Act (collectively, the Navajo Acts). The Navajo Acts
purport to give the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency authority to
promulgate regulations covering air quality, drinking water and pesticide
activities, including those activities that occur at Four Corners and the
Navajo Generating Station. On October 17, 1995, the Four Corners participants
and the Navajo Generating Station participants each filed a lawsuit in the
District Court of the Navajo Nation, Window Rock District, challenging the
applicability of the Navajo Nation as to Four Corners and Navajo Generating
Station. The Court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the
parties, and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement. APS cannot
currently predict the outcome of this matter.

In February 1998, the EPA issued regulations identifying those Clean Air
Act provisions for which it is appropriate to treat Indian tribes in the same
manner as states. The EPA has announced that it has not yet determined whether
the Clean Air Act would supersede pre-existing binding agreements between the
Navajo Nation and the Four Corners participants and the Navajo Generating
Station participants that could limit the Navajo Nation’s environmental
regulatory authority over the Navajo Generating Station and Four Corners. APS
believes that the Clean Air Act does not supersede these pre-existing
agreements. APS cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter.

In April 2000, the Navajo Tribal Council approved operating permit
regulations under the Navajo Nation Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act.
We believe the regulations fail to recognize that the Navajo Nation did not
intend to assert jurisdiction over Four Corners and the Navajo Generating
Station. On July 12, 2000, the Four Corners participants and the Navajo
Generating Station participants each filed a petition with the Navajo Supreme
Court for review of the operating permit regulations. Those proceedings have
been stayed, pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above. We cannot
currently predict the outcome of this matter.

Water Supply

Assured supplies of water are important for our generating plants. At the
present time, APS has adequate water to meet its needs. However, conflicting
claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern United States have
resulted in numerous court actions.

Both groundwater and surface water in areas important to APS’ operations
have been the subject of inquiries, claims and legal proceedings, which will
require a number of years to resolve. APS is one of a number of parties in a
proceeding before a state court in New Mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream
system from which water for Four Corners is derived. (

State of New Mexico, in
the relation of S.E. Reynolds, State Engineer vs. United States of America,
City of Farmington, Utah International, Inc., et al

., San Juan County, New
Mexico, District Court No. 75-184). An agreement reached with the Navajo
Nation in 1985, however, provides that if Four Corners loses a portion of its
rights in the adjudication, the Navajo Nation will provide, for a then-agreed
upon cost, sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss.

A summons served on APS in early 1986 required all water claimants in the
Lower Gila River Watershed in Arizona to assert any claims to water on or
before January 20, 1987, in an action pending in Maricopa County, Arizona,
Superior Court.

(In re The General Adjudication of All


Rights to Use Water in the
Gila River System and Source

, Supreme Court
Nos. WC-79-0001 through WC 79-0004 (Consolidated) [WC-1, WC-2, WC-3 and WC-4
(Consolidated)], Maricopa County Nos. W-1, W-2, W-3 and W-4 (Consolidated)).
Palo Verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons. APS’
rights and the rights of the Palo Verde participants to the use of groundwater
and effluent at Palo Verde are potentially at issue in this action. As project
manager of Palo Verde, APS filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction
over the Palo Verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual
rights to effluent relating to Palo Verde. Alternatively, APS seeks
confirmation of such rights. Three of APS’ other power plants and two of
Pinnacle West Energy’s power plants are also located within the geographic area
subject to the summons. APS’ claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its
groundwater rights with respect to these plants. Alternatively, APS seeks
confirmation of such rights. In November 1999, the Arizona Supreme Court
issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available
to the federal government and Indian tribes. In addition, in September 2000,
the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s
criteria for resolving groundwater claims. Litigation on both of these issues
will continue in the trial court. No trial date concerning APS’ water rights
claims has been set in this matter.

APS has also filed claims to water in the Little Colorado River Watershed
in Arizona in an action pending in the Apache County, Arizona, Superior Court.
(

In re The General Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water in the Little
Colorado River System and Source

, Supreme Court No. WC-79-0006 WC-6, Apache
County No. 6417). APS’ groundwater resource utilized at Cholla is within the
geographic area subject to the adjudication and is therefore potentially at
issue in the case. APS’ claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its
groundwater rights. Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights. A
number of parties are in the process of settlement negotiations with respect to
certain claims in this matter. Other claims have been identified as ready for
litigation in motions filed with the court. No trial date concerning APS’
water rights claims has been set in this matter.

Although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation, APS
expects that the described litigation will not have a material adverse impact
on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The Four Corners region, in which Four Corners is located, has been
experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants
in 2004, as well as later years if adequate moisture is not received in the
watershed that supplies the area. We are negotiating agreements with various
parties to provide backup supplies of water for 2004, if required, and are
continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement additional agreements to
minimize the effect, if any, on operations of the plant for 2005 and later
years. The effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time, and we
cannot predict the ultimate outcome, if any, of the drought or whether the
drought will adversely affect the amount of power available, or the price
thereof, from Four Corners.

BUSINESS OF PINNACLE WEST ENERGY CORPORATION

Pinnacle West Energy was incorporated in 1999 under the laws of the State
of Arizona and is engaged principally in the operation of generating plants.
Pinnacle West Energy had approximately 100 employees as of December 31, 2003.
Pinnacle West Energy’s principal offices are located at 400 North Fifth Street,
Phoenix, Arizona 85004 (telephone (602) 250-4145).


See
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in
Item 7 for a discussion of
Pinnacle West Energy’s capital expenditures.

Pinnacle West Energy’s Arizona plants were built as a result of what we
believed was a regulatory restriction against APS’ construction of additional
plants and based on the requirement in the 1999 Settlement Agreement that APS
transfer its generation assets. As discussed under “APS General Rate Case and
Retail Rate Adjustment Mechanisms” in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8, as part of its general rate case, APS is seeking rate
base treatment of the PWEC Dedicated Assets.

At December 31, 2003, Pinnacle West Energy had total assets of $1.4
billion. Pinnacle West Energy had a net loss of $1 million in 2003, a net loss
of $19 million in 2002 and net income of $18 million in 2001. See footnote (c)
in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Earnings Contributions by Subsidiary and Business Segments” in
Item 7 for a discussion of Pinnacle West Energy’s contract to supply purchase
power requirements in summer months through September 2006.

BUSINESS OF APS ENERGY SERVICES COMPANY, INC.

El Dorado had pretax income of $7 million in 2003, a pretax loss of $55
million in 2002 and net income of $0.2 million in 2001. The parent company
recorded income taxes related to El Dorado in 2003 and 2002. See
“Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” in
Item 7 for information regarding El Dorado’s 2002 losses. At December 31,
2003, El Dorado had total assets of $27 million.


ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Capacity

Our generating facilities are described below. For APS’ plants, the “net
accredited capacities” are reported, consistent with industry practice for
regulated utilities. For Pinnacle West Energy, the “permitted capacities” are
reported, consistent with industry practice for unregulated plants.

Reserve Margin

APS’ 2003 peak one-hour demand on its electric system was recorded on July
14, 2003 at 6,332,400 kW, compared to the 2002 peak of 5,802,900 kW recorded
on July 9, 2002. Firm purchases totaling 4,198,000 kW, including short-term
seasonal purchases and unit contingent purchases, were in place at the time of
the peak, ensuring the ability to meet the load requirement, with an actual
reserve margin of 12.1%. Taking into account additional capacity then
available to APS under long-term purchase power contracts as well as APS’ and
Pinnacle West Energy’s generating capacity, APS’ capability of meeting system
demand on July 14, 2003 amounted to 6,371,600 kW, for an installed reserve
margin of 1.0%. The power actually available to APS from its resources
fluctuates from time to time due in part to outages, both planned and
unplanned, and technical problems. The available capacity from sources
actually operable at the time of the 2003 peak amounted to 3,736,500 kW, for a
margin of negative 50.4%.

See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company – Purchased Power
Agreements” in Item 1 for information about certain of APS’ long-term power
agreements. See “Request for Proposals” in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 for information regarding a request for
proposals issued by APS in December 2003 for the purchase of at least 500 MW of
long-term power supply resources for delivery beginning June 1, 2007.

Plant Sites Leased from Navajo Nation

The Navajo Generating Station and Four Corners are located on land held
under easements from the federal government and also under leases from the
Navajo Nation. These are long-term agreements with options to extend, and we
do not believe that the risk with respect to enforcement of these easements and
leases is material. The majority of coal contracted for use in these plants
and certain associated transmission lines are also located on Indian
reservations. See “Purchased Power and Generating Fuel – Coal Supply” in Item
1.

Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station

Regulatory

Operation of each of the three Palo Verde units requires an operating
license from the NRC. The NRC issued full power operating licenses for Unit 1
in June 1985, Unit 2 in April 1986 and Unit 3 in November 1987. The full power
operating licenses, each valid for a period of approximately 40 years,
authorize APS, as operating agent for Palo Verde, to operate the three Palo
Verde units at full power.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

The NRC rules on financial assurance requirements for the decommissioning
of nuclear power plants provide that a licensee may use a trust as the
exclusive financial assurance mechanism if the licensee recovers estimated
total decommissioning costs through cost of service rates or through a
“non-bypassable charge.” The “non-bypassable systems benefits” charge is the
charge that the ACC has approved to recover certain types of ACC-approved
costs, including costs for low income programs, demand side management,
consumer education, environmental, renewables, etc. “Non-bypassable” means
that if a customer chooses to take energy from an “energy service provider”


other than APS, the customer will still have to pay this charge as part of
the customer’s APS electric bill.

Other mechanisms are prescribed, including prepayment, if the requirements
for exclusive reliance on the external sinking fund mechanism are not met. APS
currently relies on the external sinking fund mechanism to meet the NRC
financial assurance requirements for its interests in Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and
3. The decommissioning costs of Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3 are currently
included in APS’ ACC jurisdictional rates. The Rules provide that
decommissioning costs would be recovered through a non-bypassable “system
benefits” charge, which would allow APS to maintain its external sinking fund
mechanism. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
for additional information about our nuclear decommissioning costs.

Palo Verde Liability and Insurance Matters

See “Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station” in Note 11 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of the insurance
maintained by the Palo Verde participants, including APS, for Palo Verde.

Property Not Held in Fee or Subject to Encumbrances

Palo Verde Leases

In 1986, APS sold about 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain
common facilities in three separate sale leaseback transactions. APS accounts
for these leases as operating leases. The leases, which have terms of 29.5
years, contain options to renew the leases for two additional years and to
purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms. See
Notes 9 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for
additional information regarding the Palo Verde Unit 2 sale leaseback
transactions.

APS First Mortgage Lien

APS’ first mortgage bondholders share a lien on substantially all utility
plant assets (other than nuclear fuel and transportation equipment and other
excluded assets). See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 for information regarding APS’ outstanding first mortgage bonds.

Transmission Access

APS’ transmission facilities consist of approximately 5,000 pole miles of
overhead lines and approximately 35 miles of underground lines, all of which
are located within the State of Arizona. APS’ distribution facilities consist
of approximately 12,000 pole miles of overhead lines and approximately 13,000
miles of underground lines, all of which are located within the State of
Arizona. In June 2003 APS energized a new 37-mile 500-kilovolt transmission
line that runs from Palo Verde to the Phoenix area. See also “Regional
Transmission Organizations” in Item 1 above.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes that appear in Item 8
of this report.

OVERVIEW

We own all of the outstanding common stock of APS. APS is a
vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale
electric service to substantially all of the state of Arizona, with the major
exceptions of the Tucson metropolitan area and about one-half of the Phoenix
metropolitan area. Through its marketing and trading division, APS also
generates, sells and delivers electricity to wholesale customers in the western
United States. APS has historically accounted for a substantial part of our
revenues and earnings. Growth in APS’ service territory is about three times
the national average and remains a fundamental driver of our revenues and
earnings.

Pinnacle West Energy is our unregulated generation subsidiary. We formed
Pinnacle West Energy in 1999 as a result of the ACC’s requirement that APS
transfer all of its competitive assets and services to an affiliate or to a
third party by the end of 2002. We planned to transfer APS’ generation assets
to Pinnacle West Energy. Additionally, Pinnacle West Energy constructed
several power plants to meet growing energy needs (1790 MW in Arizona and 570
MW in Nevada). In September 2002, the ACC issued the Track A Order, which
prohibited APS from transferring its generation assets to Pinnacle West Energy.
As a result of the Track A Order, we are seeking to transfer the plants built
by Pinnacle West Energy in Arizona to APS to unite the Arizona generation under
one common owner, as originally intended.

SunCor, our real estate development subsidiary, has been and is expected
to be an important source of earnings and cash flow, particularly during the
years 2003 through 2005 due to accelerated asset sales activity. Our
subsidiary, APS Energy Services, provides competitive commodity-related energy
services and energy-related products and services to commercial, industrial and
institutional retail customers in the western United States.

The earnings contributions of our marketing and trading segment
significantly decreased over the past two years due to lower market liquidity
and deteriorating counterparty credit in the wholesale power markets in the
western United States. The marketing and trading division focuses primarily on
managing APS’ purchased power and fuel risks in connection with APS’ costs of
serving retail customer energy requirements. We currently expect contributions
from our trading activities to be negligible for 2004 and approximately $10
million (pretax) annually thereafter.

We continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity
generation and delivery activities. In the generation area, 2003 represented
the twelfth consecutive year Palo Verde was the largest power producer in the
United States. In the delivery area, we focus on superior reliability and
expanding our transmission and distribution system to meet growth and sustain
reliability.


We believe APS’ general rate case pending before the ACC is the key issue
affecting our outlook. As discussed in greater detail in Note 3 in Item 8, in
this rate case APS has requested, among other things, a 9.8% retail rate
increase (approximately $175 million annually), rate treatment for the PWEC
Dedicated Assets and the recovery of $234 million written off by APS as part of
the 1999 Settlement Agreement. In its filed testimony, the ACC staff
recommended, among other things, that the ACC decrease APS’ rates by
approximately 8% (approximately $143 million annually), not allow the PWEC
Dedicated Assets to be included in APS’ rate base, and not allow APS to recover
any of the $234 million written off as a result of the 1999 Settlement
Agreement. The ACC staff recommendations, if implemented as proposed, could
have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial
position, liquidity, dividend sustainability, credit ratings and access to
capital markets. We believe that APS’ rate case requests are supported by,
among other things, APS’ demonstrated need for the PWEC Dedicated Assets; APS’
need to attract capital at reasonable rates of return to support the required
capital investment to ensure continued customer reliability in APS’ high-growth
service territory; and the conditions in the western energy market. As a
result, we believe it is unlikely that the ACC would adopt the ACC staff
recommendations in their present form, although we can give no assurances in
that regard. The hearing on the rate case is scheduled to begin on May 25,
2004. We believe the ACC will be able to make a decision by the end of 2004.

Other factors affecting our past and future financial results include
customer growth; purchased power and fuel costs; operations and maintenance
expenses, including those relating to plant outages; weather variations;
depreciation and amortization expenses, which are affected by net additions to
existing utility plant and other property and changes in regulatory asset
amortization; and the expected performance of our subsidiaries, SunCor and El
Dorado.

EARNINGS CONTRIBUTIONS BY SUBSIDIARY AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS

We have three principal business segments (determined by products,
services and the regulatory environment):

•

our regulated electricity segment, which consists of
traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses
and related activities and includes electricity generation,
transmission and distribution;

•

our marketing and trading segment, which consists of our
competitive energy business activities, including wholesale
marketing and trading and APS Energy Services’ commodity-related
energy services. In early 2003, we moved our marketing and trading
activities to APS from Pinnacle West (existing wholesale contracts
remained at Pinnacle West) as a result of the ACC’s Track A Order
prohibiting the previously required transfer of APS’ generating
assets to Pinnacle West Energy; and

•

our real estate segment, which consists of SunCor’s real
estate development and investment activities.

The following tables summarize net income and segment details for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 for Pinnacle West and each of our

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

Throughout the following explanations of our results of operations, we
refer to “gross margin.” With respect to our regulated electricity segment and
our marketing and trading segment, gross margin refers to electric operating
revenues less purchased power and fuel costs. Our real estate segment gross
margin refers to real estate revenues less real estate operations costs of
SunCor. Other gross margin refers to other operating revenues less other
operating expenses, which primarily includes El Dorado’s investment in NAC,
which we began consolidating in our financial statements in July 2002. Other
gross margin also includes amounts related to APS Energy Services’ energy
consulting services. In addition, we have reclassified certain prior period
amounts to conform to our current period presentation, including netting of
certain revenues and purchased power amounts as a result of the adoption of
EITF 03-11, “Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That
Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not ‘Held for Trading Purposes’ As
Defined in Issue No. 02-3” (see Note 18).

2003 Compared with 2002

Our consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $241
million compared with $149 million for the prior year. The 2002 net income
includes a $66 million after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting for trading activities due to the adoption of EITF 02-3, “Issues
Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and
Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities” (see Note
18). Excluding the accounting change, the $26 million increase in the
period-to-period comparison reflects the following changes in earnings by
segment:

•

Regulated Electricity Segment – Net income was flat when
comparing the two years, due to offsetting factors. Net income in
2003 was negatively impacted by higher purchased power and fuel
costs resulting from higher prices for hedged gas and purchased
power; higher costs related to new power plants, net of purchased
power savings; higher replacement power costs from plant outages due
to higher market prices and more unplanned outages (Unit 3 of the
Cholla Power Plant experienced an unplanned outage from August 3,
2003 through November, 2003 and Units 1 and 2 of the Redhawk Power
Plant were substantially restricted for almost one-half of the
fourth quarter to correct an equipment design defect); higher
operations and maintenance costs related to increased pension and
other benefits; two retail electricity price reductions; and higher
depreciation expense related to increased delivery and other assets.
These negative factors were offset by higher retail sales primarily
due to customer growth and favorable weather; the absence of the
2002 write-off of Redhawk Units 3 and 4; lower operating costs
primarily related to severance costs recorded in 2002; lower
regulatory asset amortization; tax credits and favorable income tax
adjustments related to prior years resolved in 2003; and higher
income related to APS’ return to the AFUDC method of capitalizing
construction finance costs.


•

Marketing and Trading Segment – Income from continuing
operations decreased approximately $49 million primarily due to
lower market liquidity and deteriorating counterparty credit in the
wholesale power markets in the western United States.

•

Real Estate Segment – Net income improved approximately $36
million primarily due to increased asset, land and home sales.

•

Other Segment – Net income increased approximately $39
million primarily due to NAC losses recognized in 2002.

Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) income
from continuing operations and net income for the year ended December 31, 2003
compared with the prior year are contained in the following table (dollars in
millions).



The increase in operating and interest costs related to new power plants
placed in service by Pinnacle West Energy, net of purchased power savings and
increased gross margin from generation sales other than Native Load, totaled
approximately $30 million after income taxes in the year ended December 31,
2003 compared with the prior-year period.

Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues

Regulated electricity segment revenues were $88 million higher in the year
ended December 31, 2003 compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of:

Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues

Marketing and trading segment revenues were $105 million higher in the
year ended December 31, 2003 compared with the prior year, primarily as a
result of:


Real Estate Segment Revenues

Real estate segment revenues were $161 million higher in the year ended
December 31, 2003 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of
increased asset, land and home sales related to SunCor’s effort to accelerate
asset sales.

Other Revenues

Other revenues were $24 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2003
compared with the prior year primarily due to our consolidation of NAC’s
financial statements beginning in the third quarter of 2002, partially offset
by decreased sales activity at NAC.

2002 Compared with 2001

Our consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $149
million compared with $312 million for the prior year. We recognized a $66
million after-tax charge in 2002 for the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting for trading activities for the early adoption of EITF 02-3 on
October 1, 2002 (see Note 18). In 2001, we recognized a $15 million after-tax
charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for derivatives, as
required by SFAS No. 133 (see Note 18). Net income for 2002 includes income
from discontinued operations of $9 million after-tax related to our real estate
segment (see Note 22). Excluding the accounting changes and discontinued
operations, the $121 million decrease in the period-to-period comparison
reflects the following changes in earnings by segment:

•

Regulated Electricity Segment - Income from continuing
operations increased $18 million primarily due to lower replacement
power costs for power plants outages, retail customer growth and
higher average customer usage. These positive factors were
partially offset by a write-off of Redhawk Units 3 and 4, higher
operating costs primarily related to severance costs recorded in
2002, retail electricity price decreases, the effects of milder
weather, and higher costs for purchased power and gas due to higher
hedged gas and power prices.

•

Marketing and Trading Segment - Income from continuing
operations decreased $113 million primarily due to lower liquidity
and lower price volatility in the wholesale power markets in the
western United States.

•

Other Segment - Net income decreased approximately $33
million, primarily due to 2002 losses related to our investment in
NAC.

•

Real Estate Segment - Income from continuing operations
increased by $7 million primarily due to increased asset, land and
home sales.

Additional details on the major factors that increased (decreased) income
from continuing operations and net income for the year ended December 31, 2002
compared with the prior year are contained in the following table (dollars in
millions).



Regulated Electricity Segment Revenues

Regulated electricity segment revenues related to our regulated retail and
wholesale electricity businesses were $94 million lower in the year ended
December 31, 2002, compared with the prior year as a result of:

Marketing and Trading Segment Revenues

Marketing and trading segment revenues were $183 million lower in the year
ended December 31, 2002, compared with the prior year as a result of:

Real Estate Segment Revenues

Real Estate segment revenues were $32 million higher in the year ended
December 31, 2002 compared with the prior year primarily as a result of
increased land, asset and home sales.


Other Revenues

Other revenues were $50 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2002
compared with the prior year primarily due to the consolidation of NAC’s
financial statements beginning in the third quarter of 2002.

(a)

As discussed in Note 3 under “APS General Rate Case and Retail Rate
Adjustment Mechanisms,” as part of its 2003 general rate case, APS
requested rate base treatment of the PWEC Dedicated Assets. Pinnacle West
Energy actual capital expenditures related to PWEC Dedicated Assets were
$49 million for 2003 and are estimated to be $15 million in 2004, $21
million in 2005 and $4 million in 2006.

(b)

See “Capital Needs and Resources by Company — Pinnacle West Energy” below
for further discussion of Pinnacle West Energy’s generation construction
program. These amounts do not include an expected reimbursement by SNWA
of about $100 million (plus capitalized interest), based upon SNWA’s
agreement to purchase a 25% interest in the Silverhawk project upon
completion in 2004.

(c)

Consists primarily of capital expenditures for land development and
retail and office building construction reflected in “Real estate
investments” on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

(d)

Primarily related to the parent company and APS Energy Services.

Delivery capital expenditures are comprised of T&D infrastructure
additions and upgrades, capital replacements, new customer construction and
related information systems and facility costs.


Examples of the types of
projects included in the forecast include T&D lines and substations, line
extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to
customer information systems. APS completed the Southwest Valley transmission
project in 2003 at a cost of approximately $70 million. Major transmission
projects are driven by strong regional customer growth. APS will begin major
projects each year for the next several years, and expects to spend about $200
million on major transmission projects during the 2004 to 2006 time frame.
These amounts are included in “APS-Delivery” in the table above. Completion of
these projects will stretch from 2005 through at least 2008.

Generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to
APS’ existing fossil and nuclear plants and the replacement of Palo Verde steam
generators. Examples of the types of projects included in this category are
additions, upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment
such as turbines, boilers and environmental equipment. Generation also
includes nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately $30 million annually for
2004 to 2006.

Replacement of the steam generators in Palo Verde Unit 2 was completed
during the fall outage of 2003 at a cost to APS of approximately $70 million.
The Palo Verde owners have approved the manufacture of two additional sets of
steam generators. These generators will be installed in Unit 1 (scheduled
completion in 2005) and Unit 3 (scheduled completion in 2007). Our portion of
steam generator expenditures for Units 1 and 3 is approximately $140 million,
which will be spent through 2008. In 2004 through 2006, approximately $90
million of the Unit 1 and Unit 3 costs are included in the generation capital
expenditures table above and will be funded with internally-generated cash or
external financings.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In 2003, we adopted FIN No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,” as it applies to special-purpose entities. FIN No. 46R requires
that we consolidate a VIE if we have a majority of the risk of loss from the
VIE’s activities or we are entitled to receive a majority of the VIE’s residual
returns or both. A VIE is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal
structure that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has
equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the
entity to support its activities. In 1986, APS entered into agreements with
three separate SPE lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in Palo
Verde Unit 2. The leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance
with GAAP. See Note 9 for further information about the sale leaseback
transactions. Based on our assessment of FIN No. 46R, we are not required to
consolidate the Palo Verde VIEs. Certain provisions of FIN No. 46R have a
future effective date. We do not expect these provisions to have a material
impact on our financial statements.

APS is exposed to losses under the Palo Verde sale leaseback agreements
upon the occurrence of certain events that APS does not consider to be
reasonably likely to occur. Under certain circumstances (for example, the NRC
issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde or the occurrence
of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to assume the debt
associated with the transactions, make specified payments to the equity
participants, and take title to the leased Unit 2 interests, which, if
appropriate, may be required to be written down in value. If such an event had
occurred as of December 31, 2003, APS would have been required to assume
approximately $268 million of debt and pay the equity participants
approximately $200 million.

Guarantees and Letters of Credit

We and certain of our subsidiaries have issued guarantees and letters of
credit in support of our unregulated businesses. We have also obtained surety
bonds on behalf of APS Energy Services. We have not recorded any liability on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets with respect to these obligations. See Note 21
for additional information regarding guarantees and letters of credit.

Credit Ratings

The
ratings of securities of Pinnacle West and APS as of March 11, 2004
are shown below and are considered to be “investment-grade” ratings. The
ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies, from which an
explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained. There is no
assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The
ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in
their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Any downward revision or
withdrawal may adversely affect the market


price of Pinnacle West’s or APS’ securities and serve to increase those
companies’ cost of and access to capital. It may also require additional
collateral related to certain derivative instruments (see Note 18).

Debt Provisions

Pinnacle West’s and APS’ debt covenants related to their respective
financing arrangements include a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio and an
interest coverage test. Pinnacle West and APS comply with these covenants and
each anticipates it will continue to meet the covenant requirement levels. The
ratio of debt to total capitalization cannot exceed 65% for each of the Company
and APS individually. At December 31, 2003, the ratio was approximately 54%
for Pinnacle West. At December 31, 2003, the ratio was
approximately 53% for APS. The
provisions regarding interest coverage require a minimum cash coverage of two
times the interest requirements for each of the Company and APS. Based on 2003
results, the coverages were approximately 4 times for the Company, 4 times for
the APS bank financing agreements and 15 times for the APS mortgage indenture.
Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default
which, generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt
subject to the covenants.

Neither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’ financing agreements contain “ratings
triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and
principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, in the event
of a ratings downgrade, Pinnacle West and/or APS may be subject to increased
interest costs under certain financing agreements.

All of Pinnacle West’s bank agreements contain “cross-default” provisions
that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under
these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or APS were to default under other
agreements. All of APS’ bank agreements contain cross-default provisions that
would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these
bank agreements if APS were to default under other agreements. Pinnacle West’s
and APS’ credit agreements generally contain provisions under which the lenders
could refuse to advance loans in the event of a material adverse change in
financial condition or financial prospects.


Capital Needs and Resources by Company

Pinnacle West (Parent Company)

Our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders; interest
payments and optional and mandatory repayments of principal on our long-term
debt (see the table above for our contractual requirements, including our debt
repayment obligations, but excluding optional repayments) and equity infusions
into our subsidiaries, primarily Pinnacle West Energy. On October 22, 2003,
our board of directors increased the common stock dividend to an indicated
annual rate of $1.80 per share from $1.70 per share, effective with the
December 1, 2003 dividend payment. The level of our common dividends and
future dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including, but
not limited to, payout ratio trends, free cash flow and financial market
conditions.

Our primary sources of cash are dividends from APS, external financings
and cash distributions from our other subsidiaries, primarily SunCor. For the
years 2001 through 2003, total dividends from APS were $510 million and total
distributions from SunCor were $121 million. For the year ended December 31,
2003, dividends from APS were approximately $170 million and distributions from
SunCor were approximately $108 million. We expect SunCor to make cash
distributions to the parent company of $80 to $100 million annually in 2004 and
2005 due to anticipated accelerated asset sales activity. As discussed in Note
3 under “ACC Financing Orders,” APS must maintain a common equity ratio of at
least 40% and may not pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its
common equity below that threshold. As defined in the Financing Order, common
equity ratio is common equity divided by common equity plus long-term debt,
including current maturities of long-term debt. At December 31, 2003, APS’
common equity ratio was approximately 46%.

On May 12, 2003, APS issued $500 million of debt as follows: $300 million
aggregate principal amount of its 4.65% Notes due 2015 and $200 million
aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% Notes due 2033. Also on May 12, 2003,
APS made a $500 million loan to Pinnacle West Energy, and Pinnacle West Energy
distributed the net proceeds of that loan to us to fund our repayment of a
portion of the debt incurred to finance the construction of the PWEC Dedicated
Assets. See “ACC Financing Order” in Note 3 for additional information. With
Pinnacle West Energy’s distribution to us on May 12, 2003, we repaid the
outstanding balance ($167 million) under a credit facility. We used a portion
of the remaining proceeds to redeem our $250 million Floating Rate Notes due
2003 on June 2, 2003 and to repay other short-term debt. On November 12, 2003,
we issued $165 million of our Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2005.

At December 31, 2003, the parent company’s outstanding long-term debt,
including current maturities, was $681 million. At December 31, 2003, we had
unused credit commitments from various banks totaling $275 million, which were
available to support the issuance of commercial paper or to be used as bank
borrowings. At December 31, 2003, we had no commercial paper outstanding and
no short-term borrowings. We ended 2003 in an invested position.

Pinnacle West sponsors a pension plan that covers employees of Pinnacle
West and our subsidiaries. We contribute at least the minimum amount required
under IRS regulations, but no more than the maximum tax-deductible amount. The
minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of the fund assets
and our pension obligation. We elected to contribute cash to our pension plan
in each of the last five years; our minimum required contributions during each
of


those years was zero. Specifically, we contributed $73 million for 2002 ($46
million of which was contributed in June 2003); $24 million for 2001; $44
million for 2000 ($20 million of which was contributed in 2001); and $25
million for 1999. APS and other subsidiaries fund their share of the pension
contribution, of which APS represents approximately 89% of the total funding
amounts described above. The assets in the plan are mostly domestic common
stocks, bonds and real estate. Future year contribution amounts are dependent
on fund performance and fund valuation assumptions. Under current law, we are
required to contribute approximately $100 million to our pension plans in 2004
and expect to contribute approximately $50 million to our other postretirement
benefit plan in 2004. If currently pending legislation is enacted, our
required pension contribution in 2004 would decrease to the $25 to $50 million
range.

APS

APS’ capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and
optional and mandatory redemptions of long-term debt. See “Pinnacle West
(Parent Company)” above and Note 3 for discussion of the $500 million financing
arrangement between APS and Pinnacle West Energy approved by the ACC in 2003
and discussion of a $125 million financing arrangement between APS and Pinnacle
West.

APS pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations and, to
the extent necessary, external financings. APS has historically paid for its
dividends to Pinnacle West with cash from operations. See “Pinnacle West
(Parent Company)” above for a discussion of common equity ratio that APS must
maintain in order to pay dividends to Pinnacle West.

On April 7, 2003, APS redeemed approximately $33 million of its First
Mortgage Bonds, 8% Series due 2025, and on August 1, 2003, APS redeemed
approximately $54 million of its First Mortgage Bonds, 7.25% Series due 2023.

On February 15, 2004, $125 million of APS 5.875% Notes due 2004 were
redeemed at maturity and on March 1, 2004, $80 million of APS’ First Mortgage
Bonds, 6.625% Series due 2004 were redeemed at maturity. APS used cash from
operations and short-term debt to redeem the maturing debt.

APS’ outstanding debt was approximately $2.6 billion at December 31, 2003.
At December 31, 2003, APS had unused credit commitments from various banks
totaling about $250 million, which were available either to support the
issuance of commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings. At December 31,
2003, APS had no outstanding commercial paper or bank borrowings. APS ended
2003 in an invested position.

Although provisions in APS’ first mortgage bond indenture, articles of
incorporation and ACC financing orders establish maximum amounts of additional
first mortgage bonds, debt and preferred stock that APS may issue, APS does not
expect any of these provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital
requirements.

Pinnacle West Energy

The costs of Pinnacle West Energy’s construction of 2,360 MW of
generating capacity from 2000 through 2004 are expected to be about $1.4
billion, of which $1.35 billion has been incurred


through December 31, 2003. This does not reflect the proceeds from an
anticipated sale in 2004 to SNWA of a 25% interest in the 570 MW Silverhawk
Combined Cycle Plant 20 miles north of Las Vegas, Nevada, which would equal
about $100 million (plus capitalized interest) of Pinnacle West Energy’s
cumulative capital expenditures in the project. SNWA has agreed to purchase a
25% interest in the project upon completion. Such purchase is subject to an
appropriation of funds by SNWA. Pinnacle West Energy’s capital requirements
are currently funded through capital infusions from Pinnacle West, which
finances those infusions through debt and equity financings and
internally-generated cash. See the capital expenditures table above for actual
capital expenditures in 2003 and projected capital expenditures for the next
three years.

See Note 3 and “Pinnacle West (Parent Company)” above for a discussion of
the $500 million financing arrangement between APS and Pinnacle West Energy
authorized by the ACC pursuant to the Financing Order.

Other Subsidiaries

During the past three years, SunCor funded its cash requirements with cash
from operations and its own external financings. SunCor’s capital needs
consist primarily of capital expenditures for land development and retail and
office building construction. See the capital expenditures table above for
actual capital expenditures in 2003 and projected capital expenditures for the
next three years. SunCor expects to fund its capital requirements with cash
from operations and external financings.

In 2003, SunCor acquired or issued $10 million in long-term debt, and
redeemed, refinanced or repaid $1 million in long-term debt (see Note 6).

SunCor’s outstanding long and short-term debt was approximately $104
million as of December 31, 2003. SunCor’s total short-term debt was $86
million at December 31, 2003. SunCor had a $120 million line of credit, under
which $50 million of short-term borrowings were outstanding at December 31,
2003. SunCor’s long-term debt, including current maturities, totaled $18
million at December 31, 2003.

We expect SunCor to make cash distributions to the parent company of $80
to $100 million annually in 2004 and 2005 due to anticipated accelerated asset
sales activity.

El Dorado funded its cash requirements during the past three years,
primarily for NAC in 2002, with cash infused by the parent company and with
cash from operations. El Dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the
next three years and intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its
existing investments.

APS Energy Services’ cash requirements during the past three years were
funded with cash infusions from the parent company and with cash from
operations. See the capital expenditures table above regarding APS Energy
Services’ actual capital expenditures for 2003 and projected capital
expenditures for the next three years.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management
must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues,


expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements
and during the reporting period. Some of those judgments can be subjective and
complex, and actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the
following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the
uncertainties, judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting
standards and operations involved.

Regulatory Accounting

Regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators, such as the
ACC and the FERC, to be reflected in our financial statements. Their actions
may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense
in the current period by unregulated companies. If future recovery of costs
ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current
period earnings. We had $165 million of regulatory assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at December 31, 2003. See Notes 1 and 3 for more information
about regulatory assets and APS’ general rate case.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting

Changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and
other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant
impact on our earnings and financial position. The most relevant actuarial
assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net
periodic cost, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to
estimate earnings on invested funds over the long-term, and the assumed
healthcare cost trend rates. We review these assumptions on an annual basis
and adjust them as necessary.

The following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain
actuarial assumptions would have had on the 2003 projected benefit obligation,
our 2003 reported pension liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and our
2003 reported pension expense, after consideration of amounts capitalized or
billed to electric plant participants, on our Consolidated Statements of Income

See Note 8 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Derivative Accounting

Derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and
subject to varying interpretations. Our evaluation of these rules, as they
apply to our contracts, will determine whether we use accrual accounting or
fair value (mark-to-market) accounting. Mark-to-market accounting requires
that changes in fair value be recorded in earnings or, if certain hedge
accounting criteria are met, in common stock equity (as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss)). See “Market Risks - Commodity Price Risk” below
for quantitative analysis. See Note 18 for a further discussion on derivative
and energy trading accounting.

Mark-to-Market Accounting

The market value of our derivative contracts is not always readily
determinable. In some cases, we use models and other valuation techniques to
determine fair value. The use of these models and valuation techniques
sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment. Actual results could
differ from the results estimated through application of these methods. Our
marketing and trading portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a
portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales
transactions. See “Market Risks - Commodity Price Risk” below for quantitative
analysis. See Note 1 for discussion on accounting policies and Note 18 for a
further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting.


OTHER ACCOUNTING MATTERS

Accounting for Derivative and Trading Activities

We adopted EITF 03-11 effective October 1, 2003. EITF 03-11 provides
guidance on whether realized gains and losses on physically settled derivative
contracts not held for trading purposes should be reported on a net or gross
basis and concluded such classification is a matter of judgment that depends on
the relevant facts and circumstances. In the electricity business, some
contracts to purchase energy are netted against other contracts to sell energy.
This is called “book-out” and usually occurs in contracts that have the same
terms (quantities and delivery points) and for which power does not flow. We
netted these book-outs, reducing both revenues and purchased power and fuel
costs in 2003, 2002 and 2001, but this did not impact our financial condition,
net income or cash flows.

We adopted EITF 02-3 in the fourth quarter of 2002. We recorded a $66
million after-tax charge in net income as a cumulative effect adjustment for
the previously recorded accumulated unrealized mark-to-market on energy trading
contracts that did not meet the accounting definition of a derivative. Our
energy trading contracts that are derivatives are accounted for at fair value
under SFAS No. 133. Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative
are now accounted for on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and
costs recorded at the time the contracted commodities are delivered or
received.

In 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133 and recorded a $15 million after-tax
charge in net income and a $72 million after-tax credit in common stock equity
(as a component of other comprehensive income), both as a cumulative effect of
a change in accounting for derivatives.

See Notes 1 and 18 for further information on accounting for derivatives.

Asset Retirement Obligations

On January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations.” The standard requires the fair value of asset
retirement obligations to be recorded as a liability, along with an offsetting
plant asset, when the obligation is incurred. Accretion of the liability due
to the passage of time is an operating expense and the capitalized cost is
depreciated over the useful life of the long-lived asset. (See Note 1 for more
information regarding our previous accounting for removal costs.)

We determined that we have asset retirement obligations for our nuclear
facilities (nuclear decommissioning) and certain other generation, transmission
and distribution assets. On January 1, 2003, we recorded a liability of $219
million for our asset retirement obligations including the accretion impacts; a
$67 million increase in the carrying amount of the associated assets; and a net
reduction of $192 million in accumulated depreciation related primarily to the
reversal of previously recorded accumulated decommissioning and other removal
costs related to these obligations. Additionally, we recorded a regulatory
liability of $40 million for our asset retirement obligations related to our
regulated utility. This regulatory liability represents the difference between
the amount currently being recovered in regulated rates and the amount
calculated under SFAS No. 143. We believe we can recover in regulated rates
the transition costs and ongoing current period costs calculated in accordance
with SFAS No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of


Regulation” (see Note 1) and SFAS No. 143 (see Note 12). Adopting SFAS
No. 143 had no impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income or our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.

Variable Interest Entities

See
“Liquidity and Capital Resources - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” and
Note 20 for discussion of VIEs.

FACTORS AFFECTING OUR FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

APS General Rate Case

We believe APS’ general rate case pending before the ACC is the key issue
affecting our outlook. As discussed in greater detail in Note 3, in this rate
case APS has requested, among other things, a 9.8% retail rate increase
(approximately $175 million annually), rate treatment for the PWEC Dedicated
Assets and the recovery of $234 million written off by APS as part of the 1999
Settlement Agreement. In its filed testimony, the ACC staff recommended, among
other things, that the ACC decrease APS’ rates by approximately 8%
(approximately $143 million annually), not allow the PWEC Dedicated Assets to
be included in APS’ rate base, and not allow APS to recover any of the $234
million written off as a result of the 1999 Settlement Agreement. The ACC
staff recommendations, if implemented as proposed, could have a material
adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity,
dividend sustainability, credit ratings and access to capital markets. We
believe that APS’ rate case requests are supported by, among other things, APS’
demonstrated need for the PWEC Dedicated Assets; APS’ need to attract capital
at reasonable rates of return to support the required capital investment to
ensure continued customer reliability in APS’ high-growth service territory;
and the conditions in the western energy market. As a result, we believe it is
unlikely that the ACC would adopt the ACC staff recommendations in their
present form, although we can give no assurances in that regard. The hearing
on the rate case is scheduled to begin on May 25, 2004. We believe the ACC
will be able to make a decision by the end of 2004.

Wholesale Power Market Conditions

The marketing and trading division focuses primarily on managing APS’
purchased power and fuel risks in connection with its costs of serving retail
customer demand. We moved this division to APS in early 2003 for future
marketing and trading activities (existing wholesale contracts remained at
Pinnacle West) as a result of the ACC’s Track A Order prohibiting APS’ transfer
of generating assets to Pinnacle West Energy. Additionally, the marketing and
trading division, subject to specified parameters, markets, hedges and trades
in electricity, fuels and emission allowances and credits. Our future earnings
will be affected by the strength or weakness of the wholesale power market.
The market has suffered a substantial reduction in overall liquidity because
there are fewer creditworthy counterparties and because several key
participants have exited the market or scaled back their activities. Based on
the erosion in the market and on the market outlook, we currently expect
contributions from our trading activities to be negligible for 2004, and
approximately $10 million (pretax) annually thereafter.

Generation Construction Program

See
“Liquidity and Capital Resources - Pinnacle West Energy” for
information regarding Pinnacle West Energy’s generation construction program,
which is nearing completion. The


additional generation is expected to increase revenues, fuel expenses,
operating expenses and financing costs.

Factors Affecting Operating Revenues

General

Electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity
in regulated retail markets in Arizona and from competitive retail and
wholesale power markets in the western United States. These revenues are
expected to be affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer mix,
customer growth and average usage per customer as well as electricity prices
and variations in weather from period to period. Competitive sales of energy
and energy-related products and services are made by APS Energy Services in
western states that have opened to competitive supply.

Customer Growth

Customer growth in APS’ service territory averaged about
3.4% a year for the three years 2001 through 2003; we currently expect customer
growth to average about 3.5% per year from 2004 to 2006. We currently estimate
that total retail electricity sales in kilowatt-hours will grow 4.9% on
average, from 2004 through 2006, before the retail effects of weather
variations. The customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph
applies to Native Load customers. Customer growth for the year ended December
31, 2003 compared with the prior year period was 3.3%.

Retail Rate Changes

As part of the 1999 Settlement Agreement, APS agreed
to a series of annual retail electricity price reductions of 1.5% on July 1 for
each of the years 1999 to 2003 for a total of 7.5%. The final price reduction
was implemented July 1, 2003. See “1999 Settlement Agreement” in Note 3 for
further information. In addition, the Company has requested a 9.8% retail rate
increase to be effective July 1, 2004. See “APS General Rate Case and Retail
Rate Adjustment Mechanisms” in Note 3 for further information.

Other Factors Affecting Future Financial Results

Purchased Power and Fuel Costs

Purchased power and fuel costs are
impacted by our electricity sales volumes, existing contracts for purchased
power and generation fuel, our power plant performance, prevailing market
prices, new generating plants being placed in service and our hedging program
for managing such costs. See “Natural Gas Supply” in Note 11 for more
information on fuel costs.

Operations and Maintenance Expenses

Operations and maintenance expenses
are impacted by growth, power plant additions and operations, inflation,
outages, higher trending pension and other postretirement benefit costs and
other factors.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses

Depreciation and amortization
expenses are impacted by net additions to existing utility plant and other
property, changes in regulatory asset amortization and our generation
construction program. West Phoenix Unit 4 was placed in service in June 2001.
Redhawk Units 1 and 2 and the new Saguaro Unit 3 began commercial operations in
July 2002. West Phoenix Unit 5 was placed in service in July 2003 and
Silverhawk is expected to be in service in mid-2004. The regulatory assets to
be recovered under the 1999 Settlement Agreement are currently being amortized
as follows (dollars in millions):

Property Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of
property taxes, which are affected by tax rates and the value of property
in-service and under construction. The average property tax rate for APS,
which currently owns the majority of our property, was 9.3% of assessed value
for 2003 and 9.7% for 2002. We expect property taxes to increase primarily due
to our generation construction program, as the plants phase-in to the property
tax base over a five-year period, and our additions to existing facilities.

Interest Expense

Interest expense is affected by the amount of debt
outstanding and the interest rates on that debt. The primary factors affecting
borrowing levels in the next several years are expected to be our capital
requirements and our internally generated cash flow. Capitalized interest
offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under
construction. We stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is
placed in commercial operation. As noted above, we placed new power plants in
commercial operation in 2001, 2002 and 2003 and we expect to bring an
additional plant on-line in 2004. Interest expense is also affected by
interest rates on variable-rate debt and interest rates on the refinancing of
the Company’s future liquidity needs. In addition, see Note 1 for a discussion
of AFUDC.

Retail Competition

The regulatory developments and legal challenges to
the Rules discussed in Note 3 have raised considerable uncertainty about the
status and pace of retail electric competition and of electric restructuring in
Arizona. Although some very limited retail competition existed in APS’ service
area in 1999 and 2000, there are currently no active retail competitors
providing unbundled energy or other utility services to APS’ customers. As a
result, we cannot predict when, and the extent to which, additional competitors
will re-enter APS’ service territory.

Subsidiaries

In the case of SunCor, efforts to accelerate asset sales
activities in 2003 were successful. A portion of these sales have been, and
additional amounts may be required to be, reported as discontinued operations
on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The annual earnings contribution
from SunCor was $56 million after tax in 2003. See Note 22 for further
discussion. We anticipate SunCor’s annual earnings contributions in 2004 and
2005 will be in the $30-$40 million range after tax.

The annual earnings contribution from APS Energy Services is expected to
be positive over the next several years due primarily to a number of retail
electricity contracts in California. APS Energy Services had after tax
earnings of $16 million in 2003.

We expect SunCor and APS Energy Services to have combined earnings of
approximately $10 million per year after tax beyond 2005.

El Dorado’s historical results are not necessarily indicative of future
performance for El Dorado. In addition, we do not currently expect material
losses related to NAC in the future.

General

Our financial results may be affected by a number of broad
factors. See “Forward-Looking Statements” below for further information on
such factors, which may cause our actual future results to differ from those we
currently seek or anticipate.


Market Risks

Our operations include managing market risks related to changes in
interest rates, commodity prices and investments held by the nuclear
decommissioning trust fund and our pension plans.

Interest Rate and Equity Risk

Our major financial market risk exposure is changing interest rates.
Changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variable-rate debt and
interest earned by our nuclear decommissioning trust fund (see Note 12). Our
policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of
fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. On January 29, 2004, we entered into a
fixed-for-floating interest rate swap transaction (see Note 6 for additional
information). The nuclear decommissioning fund also has risk associated with
changing market values of equity investments. Nuclear decommissioning costs
are recovered in regulated electricity prices.

The table below presents contractual balances of our consolidated
long-term and short-term debt at the expected maturity dates as well as the
fair value of those instruments on December 31, 2003. The interest rates
presented in the tables below represent the weighted-average interest rates for
the year ended December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands).

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price
and transportation costs of electricity, natural gas, coal and emissions
allowances. We manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by
utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives, including
exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options and
swaps. Our ERMC, consisting of officers and key management personnel, oversees
company-wide energy risk management activities and monitors the results of
marketing and trading activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy
risk management and trading policies. As part of our risk management program,
we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity, fuels and
emissions allowances and credits. The changes in market value of such
contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities.
In addition, subject to specified risk


parameters monitored by the ERMC, we
engage in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from market price
movements.

The mark-to-market value of derivative instruments related to our risk
management and trading activities are presented in two categories consistent
with our business segments:

•

Regulated Electricity - non-trading derivative instruments
that hedge our purchases and sales of electricity and fuel for APS’
Native Load requirements of our regulated electricity business
segment; and

•

Marketing and Trading - non-trading and trading derivative
instruments of our competitive business segment.

The following tables show the pretax changes in mark-to-market of our
non-trading and trading derivative positions in 2003 and 2002 (dollars in
millions):

Credit Risk

We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by
counterparties. We have risk management and trading contracts with many
counterparties, including two counterparties for which a worst case exposure
represents approximately 37% of our $237 million of risk management and trading
assets as of December 31, 2003. See Note 1, “Mark-to-Market Accounting” for a
discussion of our credit valuation adjustment policy. See Note 18 for further
discussion of credit risk.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management at Pinnacle West has always understood and accepted
responsibility for our financial statements and related disclosures and the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting (“internal
control”). Just as we do throughout all aspects of our business, we
continuously strive to identify opportunities to enhance the effectiveness and
efficiency of internal control.

SEC rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require
our 2004 Annual Report to contain a management’s report and an independent
accountants’ report regarding the effectiveness of internal control. However,
in this 2003 Annual Report, we chose to voluntarily include this report on
internal control. As a basis for our report, we tested and evaluated the
design, documentation, and operating effectiveness of internal control.

In early
March 2004, the PCAOB issued its auditing standard, which may
require changes to the processes we utilize to test and evaluate the design,
documentation, and operating effectiveness of internal control and
may affect our future internal control disclosures. Based on our
assessment as of December 31, 2003, we make the following
assertion:

•

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting of Pinnacle West
Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries (the “Company”). The internal
control contains monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to
correct deficiencies identified.

•

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any
internal control, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even
effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because
of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may
vary over time.

•

Management evaluated the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2003. This assessment was
based on criteria for effective internal control over financial
reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway

Company maintained effective internal control over financial

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Pinnacle West Capital Corporation

Phoenix, Arizona

We have examined the accompanying management’s assertion that Pinnacle West
Capital Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2003, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management’s assertion based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”)
and, accordingly, included obtaining an understanding of the internal control
over financial reporting, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of the internal control, and performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Because of inherent limitations in any internal control, misstatements due to
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the internal control may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assertion that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2003 is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

An examination of management’s assertion regarding the effectiveness of
internal control under AICPA standards may not be the same in scope as an audit
of internal control under the current proposed standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) and, accordingly, may not necessarily
result in the same conclusion or disclose all matters in internal control that
might ultimately be noted in performing an audit under PCAOB standards when
they are finally adopted. Accordingly, our examination of the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is not
intended to comply with, and should not be relied upon for compliance with, the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule relating to Section 404 or Section
103 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Pinnacle West Capital Corporation

Phoenix, Arizona

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pinnacle West
Capital Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2003
and 2002 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in common
stock equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the Index. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2003 the
Company changed its method of accounting for non-trading derivatives in order
to comply with the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-11,

Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject
to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not “Held for Trading Purposes” as Defined in
Issue No. 02-3.

As discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the
Company changed its method of accounting for trading activities in order to
comply with the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-3,

Issues
Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and
Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities.

As discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the
Company changed its method of accounting for derivatives and hedging activities
in order to comply with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation and Nature of Operations

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pinnacle
West and our subsidiaries: APS, Pinnacle West Energy, APS Energy Services,
SunCor and El Dorado (principally NAC). Significant intercompany accounts and
transactions between the consolidated companies have been eliminated.

APS is a vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either
retail or wholesale electric service to substantially all of the state of
Arizona, with the major exceptions of the Tucson metropolitan area and about
one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area. APS also generates, sells and
delivers electricity to wholesale customers in the western United States. In
early 2003, the marketing and trading division of Pinnacle West was moved to
APS for future marketing and trading activities (existing wholesale contracts
remained at Pinnacle West) as a result of the ACC’s Track A Order prohibiting
the previously required transfer of APS’ generating assets to Pinnacle West
Energy. See Note 3 for a discussion of the Track A Order. Pinnacle West
Energy, which was formed in 1999, is the subsidiary through which we conduct
our unregulated generation operations. APS Energy Services was formed in 1998
and provides competitive commodity energy and energy-related products to key
customers in competitive markets in the western United States. SunCor is a
developer of residential, commercial and industrial real estate projects in
Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho and Utah. El Dorado is an investment firm, and its
principal investment is in NAC, which is a company specializing in spent
nuclear fuel technology.

Accounting Records and Use of Estimates

Our accounting records are maintained in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We
have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year
presentation.

Derivative Accounting

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price
and transportation costs of electricity, natural gas, coal and emissions
allowances. We manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by
utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives, including
exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options and
swaps. As part of our overall risk management program, we use such instruments
to hedge purchases and sales of electricity, fuels, and emissions allowances
and credits. In addition, subject to specified risk parameters monitored by
the ERMC, we engage in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from
market price movements.

We account for our derivative contracts in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”
SFAS No. 133 requires that


PINNACLE WEST CAPTAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

entities recognize all derivatives as either assets
or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair
value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are either
recognized periodically in income or, if hedge criteria are met, in common stock
equity (as a component of other comprehensive income (loss)). SFAS No. 133
provides a scope exception for contracts that meet the normal purchases and
sales criteria specified in the standard.

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2002, we accounted for our trading activity
at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in earnings as required by
EITF 98-10 “Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk
Management Activities.” In the fourth quarter of 2002, we adopted EITF 02-3
“Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading
Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management
Activities,” which rescinded EITF 98-10. We recorded a $66 million after-tax
charge in net income as a cumulative effect adjustment for the previously
recorded accumulated unrealized mark-to-market on energy trading contracts that
did not meet the accounting definition of a derivative. Our energy trading
contracts that are derivatives are accounted for at fair value under SFAS No.
133. Energy trading contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative
are now accounted for on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and
costs recorded at the time the contracted commodities are delivered or
received.

See Note 18 for additional information about our derivative and energy
trading accounting policies.

Mark-to-Market Accounting

Under mark-to-market accounting, derivative contracts for the purchase or
sale of energy commodities are reflected at fair market value, net of valuation
adjustments, with resulting unrealized gains and losses recorded as current or
long-term assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We determine fair market value using actively-quoted prices when
available. We consider quotes for exchange-traded contracts and
over-the-counter quotes obtained from independent brokers to be
actively-quoted.

When actively-quoted prices are not available, we use prices provided by
other external sources. This includes quarterly and calendar year quotes from
independent brokers. We convert quarterly and calendar year quotes into
monthly prices based on historical relationships.

For options, long-term contracts and other contracts for which price
quotes are not available, we use models and other valuation methods. The
valuation models we employ utilize spot prices, forward prices, historical
market data and other factors to forecast future prices. The primary valuation
technique we use to calculate the fair value of contracts where price quotes
are not available is based on the extrapolation of forward pricing curves using
observable market data for more liquid delivery points in the same region and
actual transactions at the more illiquid delivery points. We also value option
contracts using a variation of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

For non-exchange traded contracts, we calculate fair market value based on
the average of the bid and offer price, and we discount to reflect net present
value. We maintain certain valuation


PINNACLE WEST CAPTAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

adjustments for a number of risks
associated with the valuation of future commitments. These include valuation
adjustments for liquidity and credit risks based on the financial condition of
counterparties. The liquidity valuation adjustment represents the cost
that would be incurred if all unmatched positions were closed-out or hedged.

The credit valuation adjustment represents estimated credit losses on our
overall exposure to counterparties, taking into account netting arrangements,
expected default experience for the credit rating of the counterparties and the
overall diversification of the portfolio. Counterparties in the portfolio
consist principally of major energy companies, municipalities and local
distribution companies. We maintain credit policies that management believes
minimize overall credit risk. Determination of the credit quality of
counterparties is based upon a number of factors, including credit ratings,
financial condition, project economics and collateral requirements. When
applicable, we employ standardized agreements that allow for the netting of
positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. See
Note 18 for further discussion on credit risk.

The use of models and other valuation methods to determine fair market
value often requires subjective and complex judgment. Actual results could
differ from the results estimated through application of these methods. Our
marketing and trading portfolio includes structured activities hedged with a
portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales
transactions. Our practice is to hedge within timeframes established by the
ERMC.

Regulatory Accounting

APS is regulated by the ACC and the FERC. The accompanying financial
statements reflect the rate-making policies of these commissions. For
regulated operations, we prepare our financial statements in accordance with
SFAS No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation.” SFAS
No. 71 requires a cost-based, rate-regulated enterprise to reflect the impact
of regulatory decisions in its financial statements. As a result, we
capitalize certain costs that would be included as expense in the current
period by unregulated companies. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs
that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in
customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent the recovery of
expected future costs in current customer rates.

Management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable
of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory
environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the
same jurisdiction. This determination reflects the current political and
regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future. If
future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off
as a charge in current period earnings.

As part of the 1999 Settlement Agreement with the ACC (see Note 3), we
continue to amortize certain regulatory assets over an eight-year period as
follows (dollars in millions):

Rate Synchronization Cost Deferrals

As authorized by the ACC, operating costs (excluding fuel) and financing
costs of Palo Verde Units 2 and 3 were deferred from the commercial operation
dates (September 1986 for Unit 2 and January 1988 for Unit 3) until the date

the units were included in a rate order (April 1988 for Unit 2 and December
1991 for Unit 3). In accordance with the 1999 Settlement Agreement, we are
continuing to accelerate the amortization of the deferrals over an eight-year
period that will end June 30, 2004. Amortization of the deferrals is included
in depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Income.

Utility Plant and Depreciation

Utility plant is the term we use to describe the business property and
equipment that supports electric service, consisting primarily of generation,
transmission and distribution facilities. We report utility plant at its
original cost, which includes:


PINNACLE WEST CAPTAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We expense the costs of plant outages, major maintenance and routine
maintenance as incurred. We charge retired utility plant to accumulated
depreciation. Prior to 2003, we charged removal costs, less salvage, to
accumulated depreciation. Effective January 1, 2003, we applied the provisions
of SFAS 143 (see Note 12).

We record depreciation on utility plant on a straight-line basis over the
remaining useful life of the related assets. The approximate remaining average
useful lives of our utility property at December 31, 2003 were as follows:

For the years 2001 through 2003, the depreciation rates, as prescribed by
our regulators, ranged from a low of 1.51% to a high of 12.5%. The
weighted-average rate was 3.35% for 2003, 3.35% for 2002 and 3.40% for 2001.
We depreciate non-utility property and equipment over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets, ranging from 3 to 30 years.

El Dorado Investments

El Dorado accounts for its investments using the consolidated (if
controlled), equity (if significant influence) and cost (less than 20%
ownership) methods. Beginning in the third quarter of 2002, El Dorado began
consolidating the operations of NAC.

Capitalized Interest

Capitalized interest represents the cost of debt funds used to finance
construction projects. Plant construction costs, including capitalized
interest, are expensed through depreciation when completed projects are placed
into commercial operation. The rate used to calculate capitalized interest was
a composite rate of 4.55% for 2003, 4.80% for 2002 and 6.13% for 2001.
Capitalized interest ceases to accrue when construction is complete.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

AFUDC represents the approximate net composite interest cost of borrowed
funds and a reasonable return on the equity funds used for construction of
utility plant. Plant construction costs, including AFUDC, are recovered in
authorized rates through depreciation when completed projects are placed into
commercial operation.


PINNACLE WEST CAPTAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AFUDC was calculated by using a composite rate of 8.55% for 2003. APS
compounds AFUDC monthly and ceases to accrue AFUDC when construction work is
completed and the property is placed in service.

In 2003, APS returned to the AFUDC method of capitalizing interest and
equity costs associated with construction projects in a regulated utility.
This is consistent with APS returning to a vertically-integrated utility, as
evidenced by APS’ recent general rate case filing, which includes the request
for rate recognition of generation assets. Previously, APS capitalized
interest in accordance with SFAS No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest Cost.”
Although AFUDC both increases the plant balance and results in higher current
earnings during the construction period, AFUDC is realized in future revenues
through depreciation provisions included in rates. This change increased
earnings by $11 million in 2003 as compared to what it would have been under
SFAS No. 34.

Electric Revenues

We derive electric revenues from sales of electricity to our regulated
Native Load customers and sales to other parties from our marketing and trading
activities. Revenues related to the sale of electricity are generally recorded
when service is rendered or electricity is delivered to customers. However,
the determination and billing of electricity sales to individual Native Load
customers is based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic
basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of electricity
delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading and billing and
the corresponding unbilled revenue are estimated. We exclude sales taxes on
electric revenues from both revenue and taxes other than income taxes.
Revenues from our Native Load customers and non-derivative instruments are
reported on a gross basis in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

All gains and losses (realized and unrealized) on energy trading contracts
that qualify as derivatives are included in marketing and trading segment
revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income on a net basis.

We adopted EITF 03-11, “Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative
Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not ‘Held for
Trading Purposes’ As Defined in Issue No. 02-3,” effective October 1, 2003.
EITF 03-11 provides guidance on whether realized gains and losses on physically
settled derivative contracts not held for trading purposes should be reported
on a net or gross basis and concluded such classification is a matter of
judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. In the
electricity business, some contracts to purchase energy are netted against
other contracts to sell energy. This is called “book-out” and usually occurs
in contracts that have the same terms (quantities and delivery points) and for
which power does not flow. We netted these book-outs reducing both revenues
and purchased power and fuel costs in 2003, 2002 and 2001, but this did not
impact our financial condition, net income or cash flows (see Note 18 for
additional information).

SunCor

SunCor recognizes revenue from land, home and qualifying commercial
operating assets sales in full, provided (a) the income is determinable, that
is, the collectibility of the sales price is


PINNACLE WEST CAPTAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

reasonably assured or the amount
that will not be collectible can be estimated, and (b) the earnings process is
virtually complete, that is, SunCor is not obligated to perform significant
activities after the sale to earn the income. Unless both conditions exist,
recognition of all or part of the income is postponed. SunCor recognizes
income only after the assets’ title has passed. A single method of recognizing
income is applied to all sales transactions within an entire home, land or
commercial development project. Commercial property and management revenues are recorded
over the term of the lease or period in which services are provided. In
addition, see Note 22 – Real Estate Activities – Discontinued Operations.

Percentage of Completion – NAC

Certain NAC contract revenues are accounted for under the
percentage-of-completion method. These revenues are reported in other revenue
on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenues are recognized based upon
total costs incurred to date compared to total costs expected to be incurred
for each contract. Revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are
reflected in the accounting period when known. Provisions are made for the
full amounts of anticipated losses in the periods in which they are first
determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated
profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and
final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income, and
are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. Profit
incentives are included in revenues when their realization is reasonably
assured.

Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those
indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor,
supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. General and administrative
costs are charged to expense as incurred.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an initial
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Nuclear Fuel

APS charges nuclear fuel to fuel expense by using the unit-of-production
method. The unit-of-production method is an amortization method based on
actual physical usage. APS divides the cost of the fuel by the estimated
number of thermal units it expects to produce with that fuel. APS then
multiplies that rate by the number of thermal units produced within the current
period. This calculation determines the current period nuclear fuel expense.

APS also charges nuclear fuel expense for the permanent disposal of spent
nuclear fuel. The DOE is responsible for the permanent disposal of spent
nuclear fuel, and it charges APS $0.001 per kWh of nuclear generation. See
Note 11 for information about spent nuclear fuel disposal and Note 12 for
information on nuclear decommissioning costs.


PINNACLE WEST CAPTAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability approach
prescribed by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” We file our federal
income tax return on a consolidated basis and we file our state income tax
returns on a consolidated or unitary basis. In accordance with our
intercompany tax sharing agreement, federal and state income taxes are
allocated to each subsidiary as though each first-tier subsidiary filed a
separate income tax return. Any difference between that method and the
consolidated (and unitary) income tax liability is attributed to the parent
company. See Note 4.

Reacquired Debt Costs

For debt related to the regulated portion of APS’ business, APS defers
those gains and losses incurred upon early retirement and is seeking recovery
in the APS general rate case (see Note 3). In accordance with the 1999
Settlement Agreement, APS is continuing to accelerate the amortization of
reacquired debt costs over an eight-year period that will end June 30, 2004.
All regulatory asset amortization is included in depreciation and amortization
expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Real Estate Investments

Real estate investments primarily include SunCor’s land, home inventory
and investments in joint ventures. Land includes acquisition costs,
infrastructure costs, property taxes and capitalized interest directly
associated with the acquisition and development of each project. Land under
development and land held for future development are stated at accumulated
cost, except that, to the extent that such land is believed to be impaired, it
is written down to fair value. Land held for sale is stated at the lower of
accumulated cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell. Home inventory
consists of construction costs, improved lot costs, capitalized interest and
property taxes on homes under construction. Home inventory is stated at the
lower of accumulated cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell.
Investments in joint ventures for which SunCor does not have a controlling
financial interest are not consolidated but are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting. In 2003, SunCor acquired two joint ventures for $10
million and consolidated $53 million of assets and $43 million of liabilities,
which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2003.
The $10 million cash investment is included on the other investing line of the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow at December 31, 2003. In addition, see Note
22 – Real Estate Activities – Discontinued Operations.

Stock-Based Compensation

In 2002, we began applying the fair value method of accounting for
stock-based compensation, as provided for in SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.” The fair value method of accounting is the
preferred method. In accordance with the transition requirements of SFAS No.
123, we applied the fair value method prospectively, beginning with 2002 stock
grants. In prior years, we recognized stock compensation expense based on the
intrinsic value method allowed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No.
25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”

assets (which are primarily capitalized software costs) were $237 million at
December 31, 2003 and $214 million at December 31, 2002. The related
accumulated amortization was $128 million at December 31, 2003 and $104 million
at December 31, 2002. Amortization expense was

provides that APS will have the opportunity to recover $350 million
net present value (in 1999 dollars) through a competitive transition
charge that will remain in effect through December 31, 2004, at
which time it will terminate. The costs subject to recovery under
the adjustment clause described above will be decreased or increased
by any over/under-recovery of the $350 million due to sales volume
variances. As discussed below under “APS General Rate Case and
Retail Rate Adjustment
Mechanisms,” APS is seeking to recover amounts written off by APS
as a result of the 1999 Settlement Agreement.

•

The 1999 Settlement Agreement required APS to form, or cause
to be formed, a separate corporate affiliate or affiliates and
transfer to such affiliate(s) its competitive electric assets and
services no later than December 31, 2002. The 1999 Settlement
Agreement provided that APS would be allowed to defer and later
collect, beginning July 1, 2004, 67% of its costs to accomplish the
required transfer of generation assets to an affiliate. However, as
discussed below, in 2002 the ACC unilaterally modified this aspect
of the 1999 Settlement Agreement by issuing the Track A Order, an
order preventing APS from transferring its generation assets. APS
is seeking to recover all costs incurred by APS in preparation for
the previously anticipated transfer of generation assets to Pinnacle
West Energy. See “APS General Rate Case and Retail Rate Adjustment
Mechanisms” below.

Retail Electric Competition Rules

The Rules approved by the ACC include the following major provisions:


PINNACLE WEST CAPTAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

competitive electric assets and services to
affiliates no later than December 31, 2002. However, as discussed
below, in 2002 the ACC reversed its decision, as reflected in the
Rules, to require APS to transfer its generation assets.

Under the 1999 Settlement Agreement, the Rules are to be interpreted and
applied, to the greatest extent possible, in a manner consistent with the 1999
Settlement Agreement. If the two cannot be reconciled, APS must seek, and the
other parties to the 1999 Settlement Agreement must support, a waiver of the
Rules in favor of the 1999 Settlement Agreement.

On November 27, 2000, a Maricopa County, Arizona, Superior Court judge
issued a final judgment holding that the Rules are unconstitutional and
unlawful in their entirety due to failure to establish a fair value rate base
for competitive electric service providers and because certain of the Rules
were not submitted to the Arizona Attorney General for certification. The
judgment also invalidates all ACC orders authorizing competitive electric
service providers, including APS Energy Services, to operate in Arizona. We do
not believe the ruling affects the 1999 Settlement Agreement. The 1999
Settlement Agreement was not at issue in the consolidated cases before the
judge. Further, the ACC made findings related to the fair value of APS’
property in the order approving the 1999 Settlement Agreement. The ACC and
other parties aligned with the ACC appealed the ruling to the Arizona Court of
Appeals, and in January 2004, the Court invalidated some, but not all, of the
Rules as either violative of Arizona’s constitutional requirement that the ACC
consider the “fair value” of a utility’s property in setting rates or as being
beyond the ACC’s constitutional and statutory powers. Other Rules were set
aside for failure to submit such regulations to the Arizona Attorney General
for approval as required by statute.

Provider of Last Resort Obligation

Although the Rules allow retail customers to have access to competitive
providers of energy and energy services, APS is, under the Rules, the “provider
of last resort” for standard-offer, full-service customers under rates that
have been approved by the ACC. These rates are established until at least July
1, 2004. The 1999 Settlement Agreement allows APS to seek adjustment of these
rates in the event of emergency conditions or circumstances, such as the
inability to secure financing on reasonable terms; material changes in APS’
cost of service for ACC-regulated services resulting from federal, tribal,
state or local laws; regulatory requirements; or judicial decisions, actions or
orders. Energy prices in the western wholesale market vary and, during the
course of the last two years, have been volatile. At various times, prices in
the spot wholesale market have significantly exceeded the amount included in
APS’ current retail rates. In the event of shortfalls due to unforeseen
increases in load demand or generation or transmission outages, APS may need to
purchase additional supplemental power in the wholesale spot market. Unless
APS is able to obtain an adjustment of its rates under the emergency provisions
of the 1999 Settlement Agreement, there can be no assurance that APS would be
able to fully recover the costs of this power. See “APS General Rate Case and
Retail Rate Adjustment Mechanisms” below for a discussion of retail rate
adjustment mechanisms that were the subject of ACC hearings in April 2003.

Track A Order

On September 10, 2002, the ACC issued the Track A Order, in which the ACC,
among other things:


PINNACLE WEST CAPTAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

•

reversed its decision, as reflected in the Rules, to require
APS to transfer its generation assets either to an unrelated third
party or to a separate corporate affiliate; and

•

unilaterally modified the 1999 Settlement Agreement, which
authorized APS’ transfer of its generating assets, and directed APS
to cancel its activities to transfer its generation assets to
Pinnacle West Energy.

On November 15, 2002, APS filed appeals of the Track A Order in the
Maricopa County, Arizona Superior Court and in the Arizona Court of Appeals.

Arizona Public Service Company vs.
Arizona Corporation Commission

, CV 2002-0222 32.

Arizona Public Service
Company vs. Arizona Corporation Commission

, 1CA CC 02-0002. On December 13,
2002, APS and the ACC staff agreed to principles for resolving certain issues
raised by APS in its appeals of the Track A Order. APS and the ACC are the
only parties to the Track A Order appeals. The major provisions of the
principles include, among other things, the following:

•

APS and the ACC staff agreed that it would be appropriate for
the ACC to consider the following matters in APS’ general rate case,
which was filed on June 27, 2003:

•

the generating assets to be included in APS’ rate
base, including the question of whether the PWEC Dedicated
Assets should be included in APS’ rate base;

•

the appropriate treatment of the $234 million
pretax asset write-off agreed to by APS as part of the 1999
Settlement Agreement; and

•

the appropriate treatment of costs incurred by
APS in preparation for the previously anticipated transfer of
generation assets to Pinnacle West Energy.

•

Upon the ACC’s issuance of a final decision that is no longer
subject to appeal approving APS’ request to provide $500 million of
financing or credit support to Pinnacle West Energy or the Company,
with appropriate conditions, APS’ appeals of the Track A Order would
be limited to the issues described in the preceding bullet points,
each of which would be presented to the ACC for consideration prior
to any final judicial resolution. As noted below, the ACC issued
the Financing Order on April 4, 2003. The Financing Order is final
and no longer subject to appeal. As a result, APS’ appeals of the
Track A Order are limited to the issues described in the preceding
bullet points.

On August 27, 2003, APS, Pinnacle West and Pinnacle West Energy filed a
lawsuit asserting damage claims relating to the Track A Order.

Arizona Public
Service Company et al. v. The State of Arizona ex rel

., Superior Court of the
State of Arizona, County of Maricopa, No. CV2003-016372.

Track B Order

On March 14, 2003, the ACC issued the Track B Order, which required APS to
solicit bids for certain estimated amounts of capacity and energy for periods
beginning July 1, 2003. For 2003,


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APS was required to solicit competitive bids for about 2,500 MW of
capacity and about 4,600 gigawatt-hours of energy, or approximately 20% of APS’
total retail energy requirements. The bid amounts are expected to increase in
2004 and 2005 based largely on growth in APS’ retail load and APS’ retail
energy sales. The Track B Order also confirmed that it was “not intended to
change the current rate base status of [APS’] existing assets.”

The order recognizes APS’ right to reject any bids that are unreasonable,
uneconomical or unreliable. The ACC staff and an independent monitor
participated in the Track B procurement process. The Track B Order also
contains requirements relating to standards of conduct between APS and any
affiliate of APS participating in the competitive solicitation, requires that
APS treat bidders in a non-discriminatory manner and requires APS to file a
protocol regarding short-term and emergency procurements. The order permits
the provision by APS of corporate oversight, support and governance as long as
such activities do not favor Pinnacle West Energy in the procurement process or
provide Pinnacle West Energy with confidential APS bidding information that is
not available to other bidders. The order directs APS to evaluate bids on
cost, reliability and reasonableness. The decision requires bidders to allow
the ACC to inspect their plants and requires assurances of appropriate
competitive market conduct from senior officers of such bidders. Following the
solicitation, the decision requires APS to prepare a report evaluating
environmental issues relating to the procurement, and a series of workshops on
environmental risk management will be commenced thereafter.

APS issued requests for proposals in March 2003 and, by May 6, 2003, APS
entered into contracts to meet all or a portion of its requirements for the
years 2003 through 2006 as follows:

(1)

Pinnacle West Energy agreed to provide 1,700 MW in July
through September of 2003 and in June through September of 2004,
2005 and 2006, by means of a unit contingent contract.

(2)

PPL EnergyPlus, LLC agreed to provide 112 MW in July through
September of 2003 and 150 MW in June through September of 2004 and
2005, by means of a unit contingent contract.

(3)

Panda Gila River LP agreed to provide 450 MW in October of
2003 and 2004 and May of 2004 and 2005, and 225 MW from November
2003 through April 2004 and from November 2004 through April 2005,
by means of firm call options.

ACC Financing Orders

On April 4, 2003, the ACC issued the Financing Order authorizing APS to
lend up to $500 million to Pinnacle West Energy, guarantee up to $500 million
of Pinnacle West Energy debt, or a combination of both, not to exceed $500
million in the aggregate (the “APS Loan”), subject to the following principal
conditions:

•

any debt issued by APS pursuant to the order must be unsecured;

•

the APS Loan must be callable and secured by the PWEC Dedicated Assets;


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

•

the APS Loan must bear interest at a rate equal to 264 basis
points above the interest rate on APS debt that could be issued and
sold on equivalent terms (including, but not limited to, maturity
and security);

•

Covered Transactions less than $100 million,
measured on a cumulative basis over the calendar year in which
the Covered Transactions are made;

•

Covered Transactions by SunCor of less than $300
million through 2005, consistent with SunCor’s anticipated
accelerated asset sales activity during those years;

•

Covered Transactions related to the payment of
ongoing construction costs for Pinnacle West Energy’s (a) West
Phoenix Unit 5, located in Phoenix, and (b) Silverhawk plant,
located near Las Vegas, with an expected commercial operation
date in mid-2004; and

•

Covered Transactions related to the sale of 25%
of the Silverhawk plant to SNWA pursuant to an agreement
between SNWA and Pinnacle West Energy.

The ACC also ordered the ACC staff to conduct an inquiry into our and our
affiliates’ compliance with the retail electric competition and related rules
and decisions. On June 13, 2003,


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APS submitted its report on these matters to the ACC staff. The ACC has indicated that the preliminary investigation would
be addressed in the pending general rate case (see below).

On May 12, 2003, APS issued $500 million of debt pursuant to the Financing
Order and made a $500 million loan to Pinnacle West Energy. Pinnacle West
Energy distributed the net proceeds of that loan to us to fund the repayment of
a portion of the debt we incurred to finance the construction of the PWEC
Dedicated Assets. See Note 6.

On November 22, 2002, the ACC issued an order approving APS’ request to
permit APS to make short-term advances to Pinnacle West in the form of an
interaffiliate line of credit in the amount of $125 million. As of December
31, 2003, there were no borrowings outstanding under this financing
arrangement, and this authority expired on December 4, 2003.

APS General Rate Case and Retail Rate Adjustment Mechanisms

As noted above, on June 27, 2003, APS filed a general rate case with the
ACC and requested a $175.1 million, or 9.8%, increase in its annual retail
electricity revenues, to become effective July 1, 2004. In this rate case, APS
updated its cost of service and rate design.

Major Components of the Request

The major reasons for the request
include:

Requested Rate Increase

The requested rate increase totals $175.1
million, or 9.8%, and is comprised of the following items (dollars in
millions):

Annual Revenue

Percent

Increase in base rates

Test Year

The filing is based on an adjusted historical test year ended
December 31, 2002.


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Cost of Capital

The proposed weighted average cost of capital for the
test year ended December 31, 2002 is 8.67%, including an 11.5% return on
equity.

Rate Base

The request is based on a rate base of $4.2 billion, calculated
using Original Cost Less Depreciation (“OCLD”) methodology. The OCLD rate base
approximates the ACC-jurisdictional portion of the net book value of utility
plant, net of accumulated depreciation and deferred taxes, as of December 31,
2002, except as set forth below.

The requested rate base includes the PWEC Dedicated Assets, with a total
combined capacity of approximately 1,800 MW. These assets were included at
their estimated July 1, 2004 net book value. Upon approval of the request, the
PWEC Dedicated Assets would be transferred to APS from Pinnacle West Energy.

The filing also includes calculated amounts for Fair Value Rate Base and
Replacement Cost New Depreciated (“RCND”) rate base. The ACC is required by
the Arizona Constitution to make a finding of Fair Value Rate Base, which has
traditionally been defined by the ACC as the arithmetic average of OCLD rate
base and RCND rate base.

Recovery of Previous $234 Million Write-Off

The request includes
recovery, over a fifteen year period, of the write-off of $234 million pretax
of regulatory assets by APS as a result of the 1999 Settlement Agreement. See
“1999 Settlement Agreement” above.

Estimated Timeline

APS has asked the ACC to approve the requested rate
increase by July 1, 2004. The ACC ALJ has issued a procedural schedule setting
a hearing date on the application of May 25, 2004. Based on the schedule and
existing ACC regulations, we believe the ACC will be able to make a decision in
this general rate case by the end of 2004.

The general rate case also addresses the implementation of rate adjustment
mechanisms that were the subject of ACC hearings in April 2003. The rate
adjustment mechanisms, which were authorized as a result of the 1999 Settlement
Agreement, would allow APS to recover several types of costs, the most
significant of which are power supply costs (fuel and purchased power costs)
and costs associated with complying with the Rules.

On November 4, 2003, the ACC approved the issuance of an order which
authorizes a rate adjustment mechanism allowing APS to recover changes in
purchased power costs (but not changes in fuel costs) incurred after July 1,
2004. The other rate adjustment mechanisms authorized in the 1999 Settlement
Agreement (such as the costs associated with complying with the ACC electric
competition rules) were also tentatively approved for subsequent implementation
in the general rate case. The provisions of this order will not become
effective until there is a final order in the general
rate case, and the ACC further reserved the right to amend, modify or
reconsider, in its entirety, this November 4 order during the rate case.

Testimony

As required by the procedural schedule, on February 3, 2004,
the following parties filed their initial written testimony with the ACC on all
issues except cost of service (i.e., cost allocation among customer classes)
and rate design:

•

the ACC “litigation” staff;


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

•

the Arizona Residential Utility Consumers Office (“RUCO”), an
office established by the Arizona legislature to represent the
interests of residential utility consumers before the ACC; and

•

other approved rate case interveners.

ACC Staff Recommendations

In its filed testimony, the ACC staff
recommended, among other things, that the ACC:

•

decrease APS’ annual retail electricity revenues by at least
$142.7 million, which would result in a rate decrease of
approximately 8%, based on a 9% return on equity;

•

not allow the PWEC Dedicated Assets to be included in APS’
rate base;

•

not allow APS to recover any of the $234 million written off
as a result of the 1999 Settlement Agreement; and

•

not implement any adjustment mechanisms for fuel and
purchased power.

The ACC staff recommendations, if implemented as proposed, could have a
material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position,
liquidity, dividend sustainability, credit ratings and access to capital
markets. We believe that APS’ rate case requests are supported by, among other
things, APS’ demonstrated need for the PWEC Dedicated Assets; APS’ need to
attract capital at reasonable rates of return to support the required capital
investment to ensure continued customer reliability in APS’ high-growth service
territory; and the conditions in the western energy market. As a result, we
believe it is unlikely that the ACC would adopt the ACC staff recommendations
in their present form, although we can give no assurances in that regard.

The ACC staff also submitted testimony indicating that APS and its
affiliates had violated the “spirit, if not the letter” of the Rules, the Code
of Conduct and the 1999 Settlement Agreement.

RUCO Recommendations

In its filed testimony, RUCO recommended, among
other things, that the ACC:

•

decrease APS’ annual retail electricity revenues by $53.6
million, which would result in a rate decrease of approximately
2.84%, based on a 9.5% return on equity;

•

not allow the PWEC Dedicated Assets to be included in APS’
rate base;

•

not allow APS to recover any of the $234 million written off
as a result of the 1999 Settlement Agreement; and

•

not implement any adjustment mechanisms for fuel and
purchased power.

APS believes that its rate request is necessary to ensure APS’ continued
ability to reliably serve one of the fastest growing regions in the country and
views any ultimate decision that would deny recovery of the Company’s
investment in the PWEC Dedicated Assets as constituting a


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

regulatory “taking.”
APS will vigorously oppose the recommendations of the ACC staff, RUCO, and
other parties offering similar recommendations.

Request for Proposals

In early December 2003, APS issued a request for proposals (“RFP”) for
long-term power supply resources, and on January 8, 2004, an ACC Administrative
Law Judge issued an order requiring, among other things, APS to file a summary
of the proposals with the ACC. On January 27, 2004, APS filed a summary of the
proposals with the ACC. APS is negotiating with certain of the parties that
submitted proposals.

Federal

In July 2002, the FERC adopted a price mitigation plan that constrains the
price of electricity in the wholesale spot electricity market in the western
United States. The FERC adopted a price cap of $250 per MWh for the period
subsequent to October 31, 2002. Sales at prices above the cap must be
justified and are subject to potential refund.

On July 31, 2002, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for
Standard Market Design for wholesale electric markets. Voluminous comments and
reply comments were filed on virtually every aspect of the proposed rule. On
April 28, 2003, the FERC Staff issued an additional white paper on the proposed
Standard Market Design. The white paper discusses several policy changes to
the proposed Standard Market Design, including a greater emphasis on
flexibility for regional needs. We cannot currently predict what, if any,
impact there may be to the Company if the FERC adopts the proposed rule or any
modifications proposed in the comments.

General

The regulatory developments and legal challenges to the Rules discussed in
this Note have raised considerable uncertainty about the status and pace of
retail electric competition and of electric restructuring in Arizona. Although
some very limited retail competition existed in APS’ service area in 1999 and
2000, there are currently no active retail competitors providing unbundled
energy or other utility services to APS’ customers. As a result, we cannot
predict when, and the extent to which, additional competitors will re-enter
APS’ service territory. As competition in the electric industry continues to
evolve, we will continue to evaluate strategies and alternatives that will
position us to compete in the new regulatory environment.

4.     Income Taxes

Certain assets and liabilities are reported differently for income tax
purposes than they are for financial statements. The tax effect of these
differences is recorded as deferred taxes. We calculate deferred taxes using
the current income tax rates.

APS has recorded a regulatory asset related to income taxes on its Balance
Sheets in accordance with SFAS No. 71. This regulatory asset is for certain
temporary differences, primarily the allowance for equity funds used during
construction. APS amortizes this amount as the differences reverse. In
accordance with ACC settlement agreements, APS is continuing to accelerate


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

amortization of a regulatory asset related to income taxes over an eight-year
period that will end June 30, 2004 (see Note 1). Accordingly, we are including
this accelerated amortization in depreciation and amortization expense on our
Consolidated Statements of Income.

As a result of a change in IRS guidance, we claimed a tax deduction
related to an APS tax accounting method change on the 2001 federal consolidated
income tax return. The accelerated deduction resulted in a $200 million
reduction in the current income tax liability and a corresponding increase in
the plant-related deferred tax liability. In 2002, we received an income tax
refund of approximately $115 million related to our 2001 federal consolidated
income tax return. In 2003, we resolved certain prior-year issues with the
taxing authorities and recorded an $18 million tax benefit associated with tax
credits and other reductions to income tax expense.

5.     Lines of Credit and Short-Term Borrowings

APS had committed lines of credit with various banks of $250 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, which were available either to support the issuance
of commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings. The current line
matures in May 2004, and the document allows for a 364-day extension of the
termination date without lender consent. The commitment fees at December 31,
2003 and 2002 for these lines of credit were 0.175% and 0.09% per annum. APS
had no bank borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31,
2003 and 2002.

APS had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2003
and 2002. By Arizona statute, APS’ short-term borrowings cannot exceed 7% of
its total capitalization unless approved by the ACC.


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Pinnacle West had committed lines of credit of $275 million at December
31, 2003 and $475 million at December 31, 2002, which were available either to
support the issuance of commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings.
The current lines mature in November and December of 2004 and the $150 million
facility allows for a 364-day extension of the termination date without lender
consent. Pinnacle West had no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2003 and
$72 million was outstanding at December 31, 2002. The commitment fees ranged
from 0.125% to 0.175% in 2003 and ranged from 0.10% to 0.15% in 2002. Pinnacle
West had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2003.
Commercial paper borrowings outstanding were $24 million at December 31, 2002.
The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings was 2.06% for
the year ended December 31, 2002.

All APS and Pinnacle West bank lines of credit and commercial paper
agreements are unsecured.

On November 22, 2002, the ACC approved APS’ request to permit APS to make
short-term advances to Pinnacle West in the form of an inter-affiliate line of
credit in the amount of $125 million. This interim loan matured in December
2003, and there were never any borrowings on this line.

SunCor had revolving lines of credit totaling $120 million at December 31,
2003 and $140 million at December 31, 2002. The commitment fees were 0.125% in
2003 and 2002. SunCor had $50 million outstanding at December 31, 2003 and
$126 million outstanding at December 31, 2002. The
weighted-average interest rate was 4.50% at December 31, 2003 and
was 3.75% at December 31, 2002. Interest for 2003 and 2002 was
based on LIBOR plus 2% or prime plus 0.5%. The balance is included in
short-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. SunCor had other
short-term loans in the amount of $36 million at December 31, 2003 and $6
million outstanding at December 31, 2002. These loans are made
up of multiple notes primarily with variable interest rates based
on LIBOR plus 2.5% at December 31, 2003 and 2002. In addition, two notes acquired in 2003 had
interest rates of 3.37% and 3.87%.

6.     Long-Term Debt

Borrowings under the APS mortgage bond indenture are secured by
substantially all utility plant. APS also has unsecured debt.
SunCor’s short and long-term debt
is collateralized by interests in certain real property and Pinnacle West’s
debt is unsecured. The following table presents the components of long-term
debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets outstanding at December 31, 2003 and

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Pinnacle West’s and APS’ debt covenants related to their respective
financing arrangements include a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio and an
interest coverage test. Pinnacle West and APS comply with these covenants and
each anticipates it will continue to meet the covenant requirement levels. The
ratio of debt to total capitalization cannot exceed 65% for each of the Company
and APS individually. At December 31, 2003, the ratio was
approximately 54% for Pinnacle West. At December 31, 2003, the
ratio was approximately 53% for APS. The provisions regarding
interest coverage require a minimum cash coverage of two times the interest
requirements for each of the Company and APS. Based on 2003 results, the
coverages were approximately 4 times for the Company, 4 times for the APS bank
agreements and 15 times for the APS mortgage indenture. Failure to comply with
such covenant levels would result in an event of default which, generally
speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the
covenants.


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Neither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’ financing agreements contain “ratings
triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and
principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, in the event
of a ratings downgrade, Pinnacle West and/or APS may be subject to increased
interest costs under certain financing agreements.

All of Pinnacle West’s bank agreements contain “cross-default” provisions
that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under
these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or APS were to default under other
agreements. All of APS’ bank agreements contain cross-default provisions that
would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these
bank agreements if APS were to default under other agreements. Pinnacle West’s
and APS’ credit agreements generally contain provisions under which the lenders
could refuse to advance loans in the event of a material adverse change in our
financial condition or financial prospects.

The following is a list of payments due on total long-term debt and
capitalized lease requirements through 2008:

APS’ first mortgage bondholders share a lien on substantially all utility
plant assets (other than nuclear fuel and transportation equipment and other
excluded assets). The mortgage bond indenture restricts the payment of common
stock dividends under certain conditions. APS may pay dividends on its common
stock if there is a sufficient amount “available” from retained earnings and
the excess of cumulative book depreciation (since the mortgage’s inception)
over mortgage depreciation, which is the cumulative amount of additional
property pledged each year to address collateral depreciation. As of December
31, 2003, the amount “available” under the mortgage would have allowed APS to
pay approximately $3 billion of dividends compared to APS’ current annual
common stock dividends of $170 million.

The mortgage currently constitutes a lien on substantially all of the
property of APS. We anticipate that in early April 2004, all first mortgage
bonds issued by APS under its existing mortgage and deed of trust, other than
the first mortgage bonds securing APS’ senior notes, will have been paid and
retired. At that time, APS’ obligation to make payment on the first mortgage
bonds securing the senior notes will also be deemed to be satisfied and
discharged and the senior note first mortgage bonds will cease to secure the
senior notes. APS is then obligated to take all steps necessary to terminate
its existing mortgage and deed of trust and cannot issue any additional first
mortgage bonds under that mortgage.

8.     Retirement Plans and Other Benefits

Pinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a
non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of
Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries. Effective January 1, 2003, Pinnacle West
sponsored a new account balance plan for all new employees in place of the
defined benefit plan, and, as of April 1, 2003, the plan was offered as an
alternative to the defined benefit plan for all existing employees. A defined
benefit plan specifies the amount of benefits a plan participant is to receive
using information about the participant. The pension plan covers nearly all of
our employees. The supplemental excess benefit retirement plan covers officers
of the Company and highly compensated employees designated for participation by
the Board of Directors. Our employees do not contribute to the plans.
Generally, we calculate the benefits based on age, years of service and pay.

Pinnacle West also sponsors other postretirement benefits for the
employees of Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries. We provide medical and life
insurance benefits to retired employees. Employees must retire to become
eligible for these retirement benefits, which are based on years of service and
age. For the medical insurance plans, retirees make contributions to cover a
portion of the plan costs. For the life insurance plan, retirees do not make
contributions. We retain the right to change or eliminate these benefits.

In December 2003, FASB revised SFAS No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,” to enhance disclosures of relevant
accounting information by


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

providing additional information on plan assets,
obligations, cash flows, and net cost. The revisions are reflected in this
Note. Pinnacle West uses a December 31 measurement date for its plans.

On December 8, 2003, the President signed the “Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (the Act). One feature of the Act
is a government subsidy of prescription drug costs. We have not yet quantified
the effect, if any, on accumulated projected benefit obligation or the net
periodic postretirement benefit cost in our financial statements and
accompanying notes. Specific accounting guidance for this subsidy, including
transition rules, is pending.

The following table provides details of the plan’s benefit costs. Also

PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In selecting the pretax expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
we consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of
investments held by the plan. For the year 2003, we decreased our pretax
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets from 10% to 9%, as a result of
continued declines in general equity and bond market conditions. For the year
2004 we are assuming a 9% rate of return on plan assets. This rate is
reflective of the market returns earned historically on our target asset
allocation. As recent history has demonstrated, markets may decline and
increase dramatically. However, the long-term rate of return on plan assets of
9% is reasonable given our asset allocation in relation to historical and
expected future performance.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for the health care plans. A 1% change in the assumed initial
and ultimate health care cost trend rates would have the following effects

The Board of Directors has established an investment policy for the
pension plan assets and has delegated oversight of the plan assets to an
Investment Management Committee. The investment policy sets forth the objective
of providing for future pension benefits by maximizing return consistent with a
stated tolerance of risk. The primary investment strategies are
diversification of assets, stated asset allocation targets and ranges,
prohibition of investments in Pinnacle West securities, and external management
of plan assets.

The Investment Management Committee, described above, has also been
delegated oversight of the plan assets for the postretirement benefit plans.
The investment policy for other post retirement benefit plan assets is similar
to that of the pension plan assets described above.

Contributions

Under current law, we are required to contribute approximately $100
million to our pension plans in 2004 and expect to contribute approximately $50
million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2004. If currently
pending legislation is enacted, our required pension contribution in 2004 would
decrease to the $25 to $50 million range.

Employee Savings Plan Benefits

Pinnacle West sponsors a defined contribution savings plan for eligible
employees of Pinnacle West and subsidiaries. In a defined contribution savings
plan, the benefits a participant receives result from regular contributions
participants make to their own individual account. Under this plan, the
Company matches a percentage of the participants’ contributions in the form of
Pinnacle West stock. After a five year vesting period, participants have an
option to transfer the Company matching contributions out of the Pinnacle West
Stock Fund to other investment funds within the plan. At December 31, 2003,
approximately 23% of total plan assets were in Pinnacle West stock. We
recorded expenses for this plan of approximately $5 million for each of the
years 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Severance Charges

In July 2002, we implemented a voluntary workforce reduction as part of
our cost reduction program. We recorded $36 million before taxes in voluntary
severance costs in 2002. No further charges are expected.

9.     Leases

In 1986, APS sold about 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain
common facilities in three separate sale leaseback transactions. APS accounts
for these leases as operating leases. The gain resulting from the transaction
of approximately $140 million was deferred and is being


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

amortized to operations
and maintenance expense over 29.5 years, the original term of the leases.
There are options to renew the leases for two additional years and to purchase
the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms. Consistent
with the ratemaking treatment, a regulatory asset is recognized for the
difference between lease payments and rent expense calculated on a
straight-line basis. See Note 20 for a discussion of VIEs, including the SPEs
involved in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions.

In addition, we lease certain land, buildings, equipment, vehicles and
miscellaneous other items through operating rental agreements with varying
terms, provisions and expiration dates.

Total lease expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income
was $67 million in 2003, $67 million in 2002 and $59 million in 2001.

The amounts to be paid for the Palo Verde Unit 2 leases are approximately
$49 million per year for the years 2004 to 2015.

In accordance with the 1999 Settlement Agreement and previous settlement
agreements, APS is continuing to accelerate amortization of the regulatory
asset for leases over an eight-year period that will end June 30, 2004 (see
Note 1). All regulatory asset amortization is included in depreciation and
amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of
this regulatory asset at December 31, 2003 was $5 million.

Estimated future minimum lease payments for our operating leases are
approximately as follows (dollars in millions):

Enron

We recorded charges totaling $21 million before income taxes for exposure
to Enron and its affiliates in the fourth quarter of 2001. This amount is
comprised of a $15 million reserve for the Company’s net exposure to Enron and
its affiliates and additional expenses of $6 million primarily related to 2002
power contracts with Enron that were canceled. These charges take into
consideration our rights of set-off with respect to the Enron related
contractual obligations. The APS portion of the write-off was $13 million.
The basis of the set-offs included, but was not limited to, provisions in the
various contractual arrangements with Enron and its affiliates, including an
International Swaps and Derivative Agreement (ISDA) between APS and Enron North
America. The write-off is also net of the expected recovery based on secondary
market quotes from the bond market. The amounts were written-off from the
balances of the related assets and liabilities from risk management and trading
activities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In February 2004, Enron filed
an adversary proceeding against APS in bankruptcy court regarding differences
in the valuation of trading positions involving APS.

Enron North

Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station

Spent Fuel and Waste Disposal

Nuclear power plant operators are required to enter into spent fuel
disposal contracts with the DOE, and the DOE is required to accept and dispose
of all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive wastes generated by
domestic power reactors. Although the Nuclear Waste Act required the DOE to
develop a permanent repository for the storage and disposal of spent nuclear
fuel by 1998, the DOE has announced that the repository cannot be completed
before 2010 and it does not intend to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel prior
to that date. In November 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) issued a decision preventing the
DOE from excusing its own delay, but refused to order the DOE to begin
accepting spent nuclear fuel. Based on this decision and the DOE’s delay, a
number of utilities, including APS (on behalf of itself and the other Palo
Verde owners), filed damages actions against the DOE in the Court of Federal
Claims.

Arizona Public Service Company v. United States of
America

, United
States Court of Federal Claims, 03-2832C.

In February 2002, the Secretary of Energy recommended to President Bush
that the Yucca Mountain, Nevada site be developed as a permanent repository for
spent nuclear fuel. The President transmitted this recommendation to Congress
and the State of Nevada vetoed the President’s recommendation. Congress
approved the Yucca Mountain site, overriding the Nevada veto. It is now
expected that the DOE will submit a license application to the NRC in late
2004. The State of Nevada has filed several lawsuits relating to the Yucca
Mountain site. We cannot currently predict what further steps will be taken in
this area.

APS has existing fuel storage pools at Palo Verde and is operating a new
facility for on-site dry storage of spent nuclear fuel. With the existing
storage pools and the addition of the new facility, APS believes spent nuclear
fuel storage or disposal methods will be available for use by Palo Verde to
allow its continued operation through the term of the operating license for
each Palo Verde unit.

Although some low-level waste has been stored on-site in a low-level waste
facility, APS is currently shipping low-level waste to off-site facilities.
APS currently believes interim low-level waste storage methods are or will be
available for use by Palo Verde to allow its continued operation and to safely
store low-level waste until a permanent disposal facility is available.

APS currently estimates it will incur $115 million (in 2003 dollars) over
the life of Palo Verde for its share of the costs related to the on-site
interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. As of December 31, 2003, APS had spent
$7 million and recorded a liability of $42 million for on-site interim spent
nuclear fuel storage costs related to nuclear fuel burned to date. APS has
recorded a corresponding regulatory asset of $49 million and is seeking
recovery of these costs through future rates (see “APS General Rate Case and
Retail Rate Mechanisms” in Note 3).

APS has reclassified prior year spent nuclear fuel costs of approximately
$44 million previously included in accumulated amortization of nuclear fuel to
the liability for asset retirements and removals on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets at December 31, 2002. Upon adoption of SFAS
No. 143 in 2003, APS reclassified this liability to a regulatory liability
because no legal obligation for removal exists.


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APS believes that scientific and financial aspects of the issues of spent
nuclear fuel and low-level waste storage and disposal can be resolved
satisfactorily. However, APS acknowledges that their ultimate resolution in a
timely fashion will require political resolve and action on national and
regional scales which APS is less able to predict. APS expects to vigorously
protect and pursue its rights related to this matter.

Nuclear Insurance

The Palo Verde participants have insurance for public liability resulting
from nuclear energy hazards to the full limit of liability under federal law.
This potential liability is covered by primary liability insurance provided by
commercial insurance carriers in the amount of $300 million and the balance by
an industry-wide retrospective assessment program. If losses at any nuclear
power plant covered by the programs exceed the accumulated funds, APS could be
assessed retrospective premium adjustments. The maximum assessment per reactor
under the program for each nuclear incident is approximately $101 million,
subject to an annual limit of $10 million per incident. Based on APS’ interest
in the three Palo Verde units, APS’ maximum potential assessment per incident
for all three units is approximately $88 million, with an annual payment
limitation of approximately $9 million.

The Palo Verde participants maintain “all risk” (including nuclear
hazards) insurance for property damage to, and decontamination of, property at
Palo Verde in the aggregate amount of $2.75 billion, a substantial portion of
which must first be applied to stabilization and decontamination. APS has also
secured insurance against portions of any increased cost of generation or
purchased power and business interruption resulting from a sudden and
unforeseen outage of any of the three units. The insurance coverage discussed
in this and the previous paragraph is subject to certain policy conditions and
exclusions.

Purchased Power and Fuel Commitments

APS and Pinnacle West are parties to various purchased power and fuel
contracts with terms expiring from 2004 through 2025 that include required
purchase provisions. We estimate the contract requirements to be approximately
$209 million in 2004; $68 million in 2005; $66 million in 2006; $51 million in
2007; $51 million in 2008 and $461 million thereafter. However, these amounts
may vary significantly pursuant to certain provisions in such contracts that
permit us to decrease required purchases under certain circumstances.

Of the various purchased power and fuel contracts mentioned above some of
those contracts have take-or-pay provisions. The contracts APS has for the
supply of its coal and nuclear fuel supply have take-or-pay provisions. The
current take-or-pay coal contracts have terms that expire in 2016. The current
take-or-pay nuclear fuel contracts expire in 2004 and had not been renewed as
of December 31, 2003.

The following table summarizes the estimated take-or-pay commitments for
the existing terms (dollars in millions):

Coal Mine Reclamation Obligations

APS must reimburse certain coal providers for amounts incurred for coal
mine reclamation. Our coal mine reclamation obligation was $60 million at
December 31, 2003 and $59 million at December 31, 2002 and is included in
deferred credits-other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

A regulatory asset has been established for amounts not yet recovered from
ratepayers related to the coal obligations. In accordance with the 1999
Settlement Agreement with the ACC, APS is continuing to accelerate the
amortization of the regulatory asset for coal mine reclamation over an
eight-year period that will end June 30, 2004. Amortization is included in
depreciation and amortization expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

California Energy Market Issues and Refunds in the Pacific Northwest

In July 2001, the FERC ordered an expedited fact-finding hearing to
calculate refunds for spot market transactions in California during a specified
time frame. APS was a seller and a purchaser in the California markets at
issue, and to the extent that refunds are ordered, APS should be a recipient as
well as a payor of such amounts. The FERC is still considering the evidence
and refund amounts have not yet been finalized. APS does not anticipate
material changes in its exposure and still believes, subject to the
finalization of the revised proxy prices, that it will be entitled to a net
refund.

The FERC also ordered an evidentiary proceeding to discuss and evaluate
possible refunds for the Pacific Northwest. The FERC affirmed the ALJ’s
conclusion that the prices in the Pacific Northwest were not unreasonable or
unjust and refunds should not be ordered in this proceeding. This decision has
now been appealed to the Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit).

Although the FERC ruling in the Pacific Northwest
matter is being appealed and the FERC has not yet calculated the specific refund amounts due in California, we do not
expect that the resolution of these issues, as to the amounts alleged in the
proceedings, will have a material adverse impact on our financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

On March 26, 2003, FERC made public a Final Report on Price Manipulation
in Western Markets, prepared by its Staff and covering spot markets in the West
in 2000 and 2001. The report stated that a significant number of entities who
participated in the California markets during the 2000-2001 time period,
including APS, may potentially have been involved in arbitrage transactions


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

that allegedly violated certain provisions of the ISO tariff. APS and the
FERC staff have settled this matter, and the settlement was approved by the
FERC.

SCE and PG&E have publicly disclosed that their liquidity has been
materially and adversely affected because of, among other things, their
inability to pass on to ratepayers the prices each has paid for energy and
ancillary services procured through the PX and the ISO. PG&E filed for
bankruptcy protection in 2001.

We are closely monitoring developments in the California energy market and
the potential impact of these developments on us and our subsidiaries. Based
on our evaluations, we previously reserved $10 million before income taxes for
our credit exposure related to the California energy situation, $5 million of
which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000 and $5 million of which was
recorded in the first quarter of 2001. Our evaluations took into consideration
our range of exposure of approximately zero to $38 million before income taxes
and a review of likely recovery rates in bankruptcy situations.

In the second quarter of 2002, PG&E filed its Modified Second Amended
Disclosure Statement and the CPUC filed its Alternative Plan of Reorganization.
Both plans generally indicated that PG&E would, at the close of bankruptcy
proceedings, be able to pay in full all outstanding, undisputed debts. As a
result of these developments, the probable range of our total exposure now is
approximately zero to $27 million before income taxes, and our best estimate of
the probable loss is now approximately $6 million before income taxes.
Consequently, we reversed $4 million of the $10 million reserve in the second
quarter of 2002. We cannot predict with certainty, however, the impact that
any future resolution or attempted resolution, of the California energy market
situation may have on us, our subsidiaries or the regional energy market in
general.

California Energy Market Litigation

On March 19, 2002, the State of
California filed a complaint with the FERC alleging that wholesale sellers of
power and energy, including the Company, failed to properly file rate
information at the FERC in connection with sales to California from 2000 to the
present.

State of California v. British Columbia Power Exchange et
al

., Docket
No. EL02-71-000. The complaint requests the FERC to require the wholesale
sellers to refund any rates that are “found to exceed just and reasonable
levels.” This complaint has been dismissed by the FERC and the State of
California is now appealing the matter to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
In addition, the State of California and others have filed various claims,
which have now been consolidated, against several power suppliers to California
alleging antitrust violations.

Wholesale Electricity Antitrust
Cases I and II

,
Superior Court in and for the County of San Diego, Proceedings Nos. 4204-00005
and 4204-00006. Two of the suppliers who were named as defendants in those
matters, Reliant Energy Services, Inc. (and other Reliant entities) and Duke
Energy and Trading, LLP (and other Duke entities), filed cross-claims against
various other participants in the PX and California independent system operator
markets, including APS, attempting to expand those matters to such other
participants. APS has not yet filed a responsive pleading in the matter, but
APS believes the claims by Reliant and Duke as they relate to APS are without
merit.

APS was also named in a lawsuit regarding wholesale contracts in
California, which has now been moved back to state court.

James Millar, et al.
v. Allegheny Energy Supply, et al

., San Francisco Superior Court, Case No.
407867. The First Amended Complaint alleges basically that the contracts

unfair competition laws. The PX has filed a lawsuit against the State of
California regarding the seizure of forward contracts and the State has filed a
cross complaint against APS and numerous other PX participants.

Cal PX v. The
State of California

, Superior Court in and for the County of Sacramento, JCCP
No. 4203. Various motions continue to be filed, and we currently believe
these claims will have no material adverse impact on our financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

Citizens Power Service Agreement

By letter dated March 7, 2001, Citizens, which owns a utility in Arizona,
advised APS that it believes APS overcharged Citizens by over $50 million under
a power service agreement. APS believes its charges under the agreement were
fully in accordance with the terms of the agreement. In addition, in testimony
filed with the ACC on March 13, 2002, Citizens acknowledged, based on its
review, “if Citizens filed a complaint with the FERC, it probably would lose
the central issue in the contract interpretation dispute.” APS and Citizens
terminated the power service agreement effective July 15, 2001. In replacement
of the power service agreement, the Company and Citizens entered into a power
sale agreement under which the Company will supply Citizens with future
specified amounts of electricity and ancillary services through May 31, 2008.
This new agreement does not address issues previously raised by Citizens with
respect to charges under the original power service agreement through June 1,
2001.

Natural Gas Supply

APS and Pinnacle West Energy purchase the majority of their natural gas
requirements for their gas-fired plants under contracts with a number of
natural gas suppliers. Effective September 1, 2003, APS’ and Pinnacle West
Energy’s natural gas supply is transported pursuant to a firm, contract demand
service agreement with El Paso Natural Gas Company. Pursuant to the terms of a
comprehensive settlement entered into in 1996, the rates charged for
transportation are subject to a 10-year rate moratorium extending through
December 31, 2005.

Prior to September 1, 2003, APS’ and Pinnacle West Energy’s natural gas
supply was transported pursuant to a firm, full requirements transportation
service agreement. On July 9, 2003 the FERC issued an order that altered the
contractual obligations and the rights of parties to the 1996 settlement by
requiring all firm, full requirements contract holders to convert to contract
demand service agreements effective September 1, 2003. This required
conversion has imposed additional


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

limitations on the former full requirements contract
holders’ ability to nominate firm transportation capacity. In order for APS
and Pinnacle West Energy to meet their natural gas supply and capacity
requirements, they must make market purchases, which we expect to increase
costs by approximately $5 million per year for natural gas supply and by
approximately $14 million per year for capacity. APS and Pinnacle West Energy
have sought appellate review of the FERC’s July 9 order and related issues on
the grounds that the FERC decision to abrogate the full requirements contracts
is arbitrary and capricious and is not supported by substantial evidence.

Arizona Public Service Company and Pinnacle West Energy Corporation v. Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission

, United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit, No. 03-1209. This petition for review was consolidated

,
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, No.

Litigation

We are party to various other claims, legal actions and complaints arising
in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to environmental
matters related to the Clean Air Act, Navajo Nation issues and EPA and ADEQ
issues. In our opinion, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, results of
operations or liquidity.

12.

Asset Retirement Obligations

On January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations.” SFAS No. 143 provides accounting requirements for the
recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets. The standard requires that these liabilities be
recognized at fair value as incurred and capitalized as part of the related
tangible long-lived assets. Accretion of the liability due to the passage of
time is an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the
useful life of the long-lived asset. Prior to January 1, 2003, we accrued
asset retirement obligations over the life of the related asset through
depreciation expense.

APS has asset retirement obligations for its Palo Verde nuclear facilities
and certain other generation, transmission and distribution assets. The Palo
Verde asset retirement obligation primarily relates to final plant
decommissioning. This obligation is based on the NRC’s requirements for
disposal of radiated property or plant and agreements APS reached with the ACC
for final decommissioning of the plant. The non-nuclear generation asset
retirement obligations primarily relate to requirements for removing portions
of those plants at the end of the plant life or lease term. Some of APS’
transmission and distribution assets have asset retirement obligations because
they are subject to right of way and easement agreements that require final
removal. These agreements have a history of uninterrupted renewal that APS
expects to continue. As a result, APS cannot reasonably estimate the fair
value of the asset retirement obligation related to such distribution and
transmission assets. The asset retirement obligations associated with our
non-regulated assets are immaterial.

On January 1, 2003 and in accordance with SFAS No. 143, APS recorded a
liability of $219 million for its asset retirement obligations, including the
accretion impacts; a $67 million increase in


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the carrying amount of the
associated assets; and a net reduction of $192 million in accumulated
depreciation related primarily to the reversal of previously recorded
accumulated decommissioning and other removal costs related to these obligations. Additionally, APS
recorded a net regulatory liability of $40 million for the asset retirement
obligations related to its regulated assets. This regulatory liability
represents the difference between the amount currently being recovered in
regulated rates and the amount calculated under SFAS No. 143. APS believes it
can recover in regulated rates the transition costs and ongoing current period
costs calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 143. The adoption of SFAS No. 143
did not have a material impact on our net income for the year ended December
31, 2003.

APS has
reclassified prior year removal costs of approximately $557
million previously included in accumulated depreciation to the liability for
asset retirements and removals on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2003,
APS reclassified the portion of this liability for which no legal obligation
for removal exists to a regulatory liability.

In accordance with SFAS No. 71, APS will continue to accrue for removal
costs for its regulated assets, even if there is no legal obligation for
removal. At December 31, 2003, regulatory liabilities shown on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets included approximately $480 million of estimated
future removal costs that are not considered legal obligations.

The following schedule shows the change in our asset retirement
obligations during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2003 (dollars in

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We believe that the carrying amounts of our cash equivalents are
reasonable estimates of their fair values at December 31, 2003 and 2002 due to
their short maturities.

We hold investments in fixed income and domestic equity securities for
purposes other than trading. The December 31, 2003 and 2002 fair values of
such investments, which we determine by using quoted market prices, approximate
their carrying amount. For further information, see disclosure of cost and
fair value of APS’ nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets in Note 12.

On December 31, 2003, the carrying value of our long-term debt (excluding
capitalized lease obligations) was $3.32 billion, with an estimated fair value
of $3.46 billion. The carrying value of our long-term debt (excluding
capitalized lease obligations) was $3.00 billion on December 31, 2002, with an
estimated fair value of $3.21 billion. The fair value estimates are based on
quoted market prices of the same or similar issues.

Earnings Per Share

Dilutive stock options increased average common shares outstanding by
approximately 140,000 shares in 2003, 61,000 shares in 2002 and 212,000 shares
in 2001. Total average common shares outstanding for the purposes of
calculating diluted earnings per share were 91,405,134 shares in 2003,
84,963,921 shares in 2002 and 84,930,140 shares in 2001.

Options to purchase 2,291,646 shares of common stock were outstanding at
December 31, 2003 but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings
per share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average
market price of the common shares. Options to purchase shares of common stock
that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share were
1,629,958 at December 31, 2002 and 212,562 at December 31, 2001.

Stock-Based Compensation

Pinnacle West offers stock-based compensation plans for officers and key
employees of the Company and our subsidiaries.

In May 2002, shareholders approved the 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2002
plan), which allows Pinnacle West to grant performance shares, stock ownership
incentive awards and non-qualified and performance-accelerated stock options to
key employees. The Company has reserved 6 million shares of common stock for
issuance under the 2002 plan. No more than 1.8 million shares may be issued in
relation to performance share awards and stock ownership incentive awards. The
plan also provides for the granting of new non-qualified stock options at a
price per share not less than the fair market value of the common stock at the
time of grant. The stock options vest over three years, unless certain
performance criteria are met, which can accelerate the vesting period. The
term of the option cannot be longer than 10 years and the option cannot be
repriced during its term.


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The 1994 plan and the 1985 plan each include outstanding options but no
new options will be granted under either plan. Options vest one-third of the
grant per year beginning one year after the date the option is granted and
expire ten years from the date of the grant. The 1994 plan also provided for
the granting of any combination of shares of restricted stock, stock
appreciation rights or dividend equivalents. Following the approval of the
2002 plan, no further grants have been made under the 1994 plan, except for
awards for the annual award of up to 20,000 shares of stock to satisfy stock
award obligations under employment contracts to certain executives.

In the third quarter of 2002, we began applying the fair value method of
accounting for stock-based compensation, as provided for in SFAS No. 123. The
fair value method of accounting is the preferred method. In accordance with
the transition requirements of SFAS No. 123, we applied the fair value method
prospectively, beginning with 2002 stock grants. In prior years, we recognized
stock compensation expense based on the intrinsic value method allowed in APB
No. 25. We recorded approximately $2.1 million in stock option expense before
income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Income in 2003 and approximately
$0.5 million in 2002. This amount may not be reflective of the stock option
expense we will record in future years because stock options typically vest
over several years and additional grants are generally made each year.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” The standard amends
SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary
change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation.
The standard also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No.
148 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. We adopted
the disclosure requirements in 2002. See Note 1 for our pro forma disclosures
on stock-based compensation and our weighted-average assumptions used to
calculate the fair value of our stock options.

Total stock-based compensation cost, including stock option cost, was $6
million in 2003, $5 million in 2002 and $3 million in 2001.

as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and changes during the years ending on

Business Segments

We have three principal business segments (determined by products,
services and the regulatory environment):

•

our regulated electricity segment, which consists of
traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses
and related activities, and includes electricity generation,
transmission and distribution;

•

our marketing and trading segment, which consists of our
competitive energy business activities, including wholesale
marketing and trading and APS Energy Services’ commodity-related
energy services. In early 2003, we moved our marketing and trading
activities to APS from Pinnacle West (existing wholesale contracts
remained at Pinnacle West) as a result of the ACC’s Track A Order
prohibiting the previously required transfer of APS’ generating
assets to Pinnacle West Energy; and

•

our real estate segment, which consists of SunCor’s real
estate development and investment activities.

The amounts in our other
segment include activity
principally related to El
Dorado’s investment in NAC, as
well as the parent company and
other subsidiaries. See Note
18 for information about
reclassifications related to
the adoption of EITF 03-11.
Financial data for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001 by business segments
is provided as follows (dollars

Derivative and Energy Trading Accounting

We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price
and transportation costs of electricity, natural gas, coal and emissions
allowances. We manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by
utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives, including
exchange-traded futures and options and over-the-counter forwards, options and
swaps. As part of our overall risk management program, we use such instruments
to hedge purchases and sales of electricity, fuels, and emissions allowances
and credits. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high
correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities. In addition, subject
to specified risk parameters monitored by the ERMC, we engage in marketing and
trading activities intended to profit from market price movements.

Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133 requires
that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the
balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair
value of derivative instruments are either recognized periodically in income
or, if hedge criteria is met, in common stock equity (as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss)). We use cash flow hedges to limit our exposure to
cash flow variability on forecasted transactions. Hedge effectiveness is
related to the degree to which the derivative contract and the hedged item are
correlated. It is measured based on the relative changes in fair value between
the derivative contract and the hedged item over time. We exclude the time
value of certain options from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. Any
change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, or the amount by which
the derivative contract and the hedged commodity are not directly correlated,
is recognized immediately in net income.


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In 2001, we recorded a $15 million after-tax charge in net income and a
$72 million after-tax credit in common stock equity (as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss)), both as cumulative effects of a change in
accounting for derivatives. The charge primarily resulted from electricity
option contracts. The credit resulted from unrealized gains on cash flow
hedges.

During 2002, the EITF discussed EITF 02-3 and reached a consensus on
certain issues. EITF 02-3 rescinded EITF 98-10 and was effective October 25,
2002 for any new contracts, and on January 1, 2003 for existing contracts, with
early adoption permitted. We adopted the EITF 02-3 guidance for all contracts
in the fourth quarter of 2002. We recorded a $66 million after-tax charge in
net income as a cumulative effect adjustment for the previously recorded
accumulated unrealized mark-to-market on energy trading contracts that did not
meet the accounting definition of a derivative. Our energy trading contracts
that are derivatives are accounted for at fair value under SFAS No. 133.
Energy trading contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative are
accounted for on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs
recorded at the time the contracted commodities are delivered or received.
Additionally, all gains and losses (realized and unrealized) on energy trading
contracts that qualify as derivatives are included in marketing and trading
segment revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income on a net basis.
Derivative instruments used for non-trading activities are accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No. 133.

Both non-trading and trading derivatives are classified as assets and
liabilities from risk management and trading activities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. For non-trading derivative instruments that qualify for cash
flow hedge accounting treatment, changes in the fair value of the effective
portion are recognized in common stock equity (as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss)). Non-trading derivatives, or any portion thereof,
that are not effective hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. Gains
and losses related to non-trading derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges
of expected transactions are recognized in revenue or purchased power and fuel
expense as an offset to the related item being hedged when the underlying
hedged physical transaction impacts earnings. If it becomes probable that a
forecasted transaction will not occur, we discontinue the use of hedge
accounting and recognize in income the unrealized gains and losses that were
previously recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). In the event a
non-trading derivative is terminated or settled, the unrealized gains and
losses remain in other comprehensive income (loss), and are recognized in
income when the underlying transaction impacts earnings. Derivative commodity
contracts for the physical delivery of purchase and sale quantities transacted
in the normal course of business are exempt from the requirements of SFAS No.
133 under the normal purchase and sales exception and are not reflected on the
balance sheet at fair value. Certain of our non-trading electricity purchase
and sales agreements qualify as normal purchases and sales and are exempted
from recognition in the financial statements until the electricity is
delivered. Derivatives associated with trading activities are adjusted to fair
value through income.

EITF 02-3 requires that derivatives held for trading purposes, whether
settled financially or physically, be reported in the income statement on a net
basis. Previous guidance under EITF 98-10 permitted physically-settled energy
trading contracts to be reported either gross or net in the income statement.
Beginning in the third quarter of 2002, we netted all of our energy trading
activities on the Consolidated Statements of Income and restated prior year
amounts for all periods presented. Reclassification of such trading activity
to a net basis of reporting resulted in reductions in both

revenues and purchased power and fuel costs, but did not have any impact
on our financial condition, net income or cash flows.

We adopted EITF 03-11, “Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative
Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not ‘Held for
Trading Purposes’ As Defined in Issue No. 02-3,” effective October 1, 2003.
EITF 03-11 provided guidance on whether realized gains and losses on physically
settled derivative contracts not held for trading purposes should be reported
on a net or gross basis and concluded such classification is a matter of
judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. In the
electricity business, some contracts to purchase energy are netted against
other contracts to sell energy. This is called “book-out” and usually occurs
in contracts that have the same terms (quantities and delivery points) and for
which power does not flow. We netted these book-outs, reducing both revenues
and purchased power and fuel costs in 2003, 2002 and 2001, but this did not
impact our financial condition, net income or cash flows. Following are the
net reclassifications to our previously reported amounts (dollars in
thousands):

In November 2003, the FASB revised its derivative guidance in DIG Issue
No. C15, “Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception for Option-Type Contracts
and Forward Contracts in Electricity.” Effective January 1, 2004, the new
guidance changes the criteria for the normal purchases and sales scope
exception for electricity contracts. We do not expect this guidance to have a
material impact on our financial statements.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133
on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” This statement amends and
clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and for
hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. The provisions of SFAS No. 149 that
relate to previously issued SFAS No. 133 derivatives implementation guidance
should continue to be applied in accordance with the effective dates of the
original implementation guidance. In general, other provisions are applied
prospectively to contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and
for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The impact of this
standard was immaterial to our financial statements.

The changes in the fair value of our hedged positions included in the
Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002 are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):

As of December 31, 2003, the maximum length of time over which we are
hedging our exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted
transactions is approximately five years. During the year ending December 31,
2004, we estimate that a net gain of $8 million before income taxes will be
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an offset to the
effect on earnings of market price changes for the related hedged transactions.

Our assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities are
presented in two categories, consistent with our business segments:

•

Regulated Electricity – non-trading derivative instruments
that hedge our purchases and sales of electricity and fuel for APS’
Native Load requirements of our regulated electricity business
segment; and

•

Marketing and Trading – both non-trading and trading
derivative instruments of our competitive business segment.

Cash or collateral may be required to serve as collateral against our open
positions on certain energy-related contracts. Collateral provided to
counterparties is $1 million at December 31, 2003 and $5 million at December
31, 2002, and is included in investments and other assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. Collateral provided to us by counterparties is $12 million at
December 31, 2003 and $22 million at December 31, 2002, and is included in
other deferred credits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Credit Risk

We are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by
counterparties. We have risk management and trading contracts with many
counterparties, including two counterparties for which a worst case exposure
represents approximately 37% of our $237 million of risk management and trading
assets as of December 31, 2003. Our risk management process assesses and
monitors the financial exposure of these and all other counterparties. Despite
the fact that the great majority of trading counterparties are rated as
investment grade by the credit rating agencies, including the counterparties
noted above, there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies
could default, resulting in a material impact on consolidated earnings for a
given period. Counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of major
energy companies, municipalities and local distribution companies. We maintain
credit policies that we believe minimize overall credit risk to within
acceptable limits. Determination of the credit quality of our counterparties
is based upon a number of factors, including credit ratings and our evaluation
of their financial condition. In many contracts, we employ collateral
requirements and standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive
and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. Valuation
adjustments are established representing our estimated credit losses on our
overall exposure to counterparties. See Note 1 “Mark-to-Market Accounting” for
a discussion of our credit valuation adjustment policy.

Other Income and Other Expense

The following table provides detail of other income and other expense for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (dollars in thousands):

(a)

Primarily related to the sale at SunCor of a land interest and profit
participation agreement in the fourth quarter of 2003 for $18 million. In
2002, SunCor received $2.5 million for the profit participation.

(b)

As defined by the FERC, includes below-the-line non-operating utility
costs (primarily community relations).

(c)

Primarily related to El Dorado’s investment losses in NAC prior to
consolidation in the third quarter of 2002.

20.

Variable Interest Entities

In 2003, we adopted FIN No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,” as it applies to special-purpose entities. FIN No. 46R requires
that we consolidate a VIE if we have a majority of the risk of loss from the
VIE’s activities or we are entitled to receive a majority of the VIE’s residual
returns or both. A VIE is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal
structure that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has
equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the
entity to support its activities. In 1986, APS entered into agreements with
three separate SPE lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in Palo
Verde Unit 2. The leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance
with GAAP. See Note 9 for further information about the sale leaseback
transactions. Based on our assessment of FIN No. 46R, we are not required to
consolidate the Palo Verde VIEs. Certain provisions of FIN No. 46R have a
future effective date. We do not expect these provisions to have a material
impact on our financial statements.


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APS is exposed to losses under the Palo Verde sale leaseback agreements
upon the occurrence of certain events that APS does not consider to be
reasonably likely to occur. Under certain circumstances (for example, the NRC
issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde or the occurrence
of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to assume the debt
associated with the transactions, make specified payments to the equity
participants, and take title to the leased Unit 2 interests, which, if
appropriate, may be required to be written down in value. If such an event had
occurred as of December 31, 2003, APS would have been required to assume
approximately $268 million of debt and pay the equity participants
approximately $200 million.

21.

Guarantees

On January 1, 2003, we adopted FIN No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others.” FIN No. 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made
by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain
guarantees. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at
inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The disclosure provisions were effective
for the year ended December 31, 2002. The initial recognition and measurement
provisions of FIN No. 45 were effective on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002.

We have issued parental guarantees and letters of credit and obtained
surety bonds on behalf of our unregulated subsidiaries. Our parental
guarantees related to Pinnacle West Energy consist of equipment and performance
guarantees related to our generation construction program, transmission service
guarantees for West Phoenix Units 4 and 5 and long-term service agreement
guarantees for new power plants. Our credit support instruments enable APS
Energy Services to offer commodity energy and energy-related products and
enable El Dorado to support the activities of NAC. Non-performance or payment
under the original contract by our unregulated subsidiaries would require us to
perform under the guarantee or surety bond. No liability is currently recorded
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to Pinnacle West’s guarantees on
behalf of its subsidiaries. Our guarantees have no recourse (except NAC) or
collateral provisions to allow us to recover amounts paid under the guarantee.
The amounts and approximate terms of our guarantees and surety bonds for each
subsidiary at December 31, 2003 are as follows (dollars in millions):

At December 31, 2003, we had entered into approximately $41 million of
letters of credit which support various construction agreements. These letters
of credit expire in 2004 and 2005. We intend to provide from either existing
or new facilities for the extension, renewal or substitution of


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the letters of
credit to the extent required. At December 31, 2003, Pinnacle West has
approximately $4 million of letters of credit related to workers’ compensation
expiring in 2004.

APS has entered into various agreements that require letters of credit for
financial assurance purposes. At December 31, 2003, approximately $200 million
of letters of credit were outstanding to support existing pollution control
bonds of approximately $200 million. The letters of credit are available to
fund the payment of principal and interest of such debt obligations. These
letters of credit have expiration dates in 2004 and 2005. APS has also entered
into approximately $109 million of letters of credit to support certain equity
lessors in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions (see Note 9 for further
details on the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions). These letters of
credit expire in 2005. Additionally, APS has approximately $5 million of
letters of credit related to counterparty collateral requirements expiring in
2004. APS intends to provide from either existing or new facilities for the
extension, renewal or substitution of the letters of credit to the extent
required.

We provide indemnifications relating to liabilities arising from
or related to certain of our agreements. APS has provided indemnifications to
the equity participants and other parties in the Palo Verde sale leaseback
transactions with respect to certain tax matters. Generally, a maximum
obligation is not explicitly stated in the indemnification and therefore, the
overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be
reasonably estimated. Based on historical experience and evaluation of the
specific indemnities, we do not believe that any material loss related to such
indemnifications is likely and therefore no related liability has been
recorded.

22.

Real Estate Activities – Discontinued Operations

Certain components of SunCor’s real estate sales activities, which are
included in the real estate segment, are required to be reported as
discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statements of Income in accordance
with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.” Among other guidance, SFAS No. 144 prescribes accounting for
discontinued operations and defines certain activities as discontinued
operations. We adopted SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002 and determined
that activities that would have required discontinued operations reporting in
2002 and 2001 were immaterial.

In 2003, SunCor sold its water utility company, which
resulted in an after-tax gain of $8 million ($14 million pretax). The amounts
of the gain on the sale and operating income of the water utility company in
2003 and 2002 are classified as discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The amounts related to 2001 were
immaterial for reclassification.

In the second quarter of 2002, SunCor sold a retail center, but maintained
a continuing involvement through a management contract. In the first quarter
of 2003, this management contract was canceled. As a result, the after-tax
gain of $6 million ($10 million pre-tax) recorded in operations in 2002 related
to this property was reclassified as discontinued operations on our
Consolidated Statements of Income. The income from discontinued operations in
the year ended December 31, 2002 primarily reflects this sale. The amounts
related to 2001 were immaterial for reclassification.


PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In the fourth quarter of 2003, SunCor sold a retail center, which resulted
in an after-tax gain of $2 million ($3 million pretax). The gain on the sale
and the operating income related to this property in 2003 are classified as
discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statements of Income. There were
no prior-year operations related to this retail center. The amounts related to
2001 were immaterial for reclassification.

Equity Compensation Plans Approved By Security Holders

The Company has four equity compensation plans that were approved by its
shareholders: the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Stock Option and Incentive
Plan, under which no new options may be granted; the Pinnacle West Capital
Corporation Directors Stock Option Plan, under which no new options may be
granted; the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan,
under which no new options and a limited number of other stock awards may be
granted; and the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2002 Long-Term Incentive
Plan. See Note 16 for additional information regarding these plans.

Equity Compensation Plans Not Approved By Security Holders

The Company has one equity compensation plan, the Pinnacle West Capital
Corporation 2000 Director Equity Plan (the “2000 Plan”), for which the approval
of shareholders was not required.


Number of Shares Subject to the 2000 Plan. The total number of shares of
the Company’s common stock granted under the 2000 Plan may not exceed 200,000.
In the case of a significant corporate event, such as a reorganization, merger
or consolidation, the 2000 Plan provides for adjustment of the above limit, the
number of shares to be awarded automatically to eligible non-employee directors
and the number of shares of the Company’s common stock non-employee directors
are required to own to receive an annual grant of common stock under the 2000
Plan.

Eligibility for Participation. Only non-employee directors may
participate in the 2000 Plan. A non-employee director is an individual who is
a director of the Company but who is not also an employee of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries.

Terms of Awards. The 2000 Plan provides for: (1) annual grants of common
stock to eligible non-employee directors, (2) discretionary grants of common
stock to eligible non-employee directors and (3) grants of nonqualified stock
options to eligible non-employee directors.

Annual Grants of Stock

Each individual who is a non-employee director as of July 1 of a calendar
year, and who meets requirements of ownership of the Company’s common stock set
forth below, will receive 900 shares of the Company’s common stock for such
calendar year. In the first calendar year in which a non-employee director is
eligible to participate in the 2000 Plan, he or she must own at least 900
shares of the Company’s common stock as of December 31 of the same calendar
year to receive a grant of 900 shares of the Company’s common stock. If the
non-employee director owns 900 shares of common stock as of June 30, he or she
will receive a grant of 900 shares of common stock as of July 1 of the same
calendar year. If the non-employee director does not own 900 shares of the
Company’s common stock as of June 30, but acquires the necessary shares on or
before December 31 of the same year, he or she will receive a grant of 900
shares of common stock within a reasonable time after the Company verifies that
the requisite number of shares has been acquired. In each subsequent year, the
number of shares of the Company’s common stock the non-employee director must
own to receive a grant of 900 shares of common stock will increase by 900
shares, until reaching a maximum of 4,500 shares. In each of the subsequent
years, the non-employee director must own the requisite number of shares of the
Company’s common stock as of June 30 of the relevant calendar year.

Discretionary Grants of Stock

The Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, excluding those
members who are not “Non-Employee Directors” under SEC Rule 16b-3(b)(3) the
Committee administers the 2000 Plan and may grant shares of the Company’s
common stock to non-employee directors in its discretion. No discretionary
grants of common stock have been made under the 2000 Plan.

Grants of Nonqualified Stock Options

The Committee can grant nonqualified stock options under the 2000 Plan.
The terms and the conditions of the option grant, including the exercise price
per share, which may not be less than fair market value on the date of grant,
will be set by the Committee in a written award agreement. The Committee will
determine the time or times at which any such options may be exercised in whole
or in part. The Committee will also determine the performance or other
conditions, if any, that must be satisfied before all or part of an option may
be exercised. Any such options granted to a participant


will expire on the tenth anniversary date of the date of grant, unless the
option is earlier terminated, forfeited or surrendered pursuant to a provision
of the 2000 Plan or the applicable award agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a participant ceases to be a Company director for any reason,
including death or disability, any such options held by that participant will
expire on the second anniversary of the date on which the participant ceased to
be a Company director, unless otherwise provided in the applicable award
agreement. Unless the Committee provides otherwise, no such options may be
sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated, other than by
will, the laws of descent and distribution, or under any other circumstances
allowed by the Committee. No options have been granted under the 2000 Plan.
