THE COMPANY

         GENERAL

         We were incorporated in 1985 under the laws of the State of Arizona and
are engaged,  through our  subsidiaries,  in the generation and  distribution of
electricity; in real estate development;  and in venture capital investment. Our
principal executive offices are located at 400 East Van Buren Street, Suite 700,
Phoenix, Arizona 85004 (telephone 602-379-2500).

         At December 31, 1998, we employed approximately 7,333 people, including
the employees of our subsidiaries.  Of these employees,  6,075 were employees of
our major subsidiary, APS, and employees assigned to joint projects of APS where
APS serves as a project manager,  and approximately 1,258 were our employees and
employees of our other subsidiaries.

         Our other  subsidiaries,  in  addition  to APS,  include  SunCor and El
Dorado. See "Business of SunCor Development  Company" and "Business of El Dorado
Investment Company" in this Item for further information regarding SunCor and El
Dorado.

         This document contains "forward-looking  statements" that involve risks
and uncertainties. Words such as "estimates," "expects," "anticipates," "plans,"
"believes,"   "projects,"  and  similar  expressions  identify   forward-looking
statements.  These risks and uncertainties  include, but are not limited to, the
ongoing  restructuring of the electric  industry;  the outcome of the regulatory
proceedings  relating to the restructuring;  regulatory,  tax, and environmental
legislation;  the ability of APS to successfully compete outside its traditional
regulated  markets;  regional economic  conditions,  which could affect customer
growth;  the cost of debt  and  equity  capital;  weather  variations  affecting
customer usage;  technological  developments in the electric industry; Year 2000
issues;  and the strength of the real estate  market.  See  "Business of Arizona
Public  Service  Company  --  Competition"  for a  discussion  of some of  these
factors.

         ARIZONA CORPORATION  COMMISSION AFFILIATED INTEREST RULES. On March 14,
1990, the ACC issued an order adopting certain rules purportedly applicable only
to a certain class of public utilities  regulated by the ACC, including APS. The
rules define the terms "public  utility holding  company" and  "affiliate"  with
respect to public service corporations  regulated by the ACC in such a manner as
to include us and all of our non-public  service  corporation  subsidiaries.  By
their terms, the rules,  among other things,  require public utilities,  such as
APS,  to  receive  ACC  approval  prior to (1)  obtaining  an  interest  in,  or
guaranteeing  or assuming the liabilities of, any affiliate not regulated by the
ACC; (2) lending to any such affiliate (except for short-term loans in an amount
less than  $100,000);  or (3) using utility funds to form a subsidiary or divest
itself of any  established  subsidiary.  The rules also  prevent a utility  from
transacting  business with an affiliate  unless the affiliate  agrees to provide
the ACC "access to the books and records of the affiliate to the degree required
to fully audit, examine or otherwise investigate transactions between the public
utility and the affiliate." In addition, the rules provide that an "affiliate or
holding company may not divest itself of, or otherwise  relinquish control of, a
public utility without thirty (30) days prior written notification to the [ACC]"
and requires all public utilities subject to them and all public utility holding
companies to annually  "provide the [ACC] with a description of  diversification
plans for the  current  calendar  year that have been  approved by the Boards of
Directors."  The  rules  have not had,  nor do we expect  the  rules to have,  a
material adverse impact on our business or operations.


                   BUSINESS OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

         Following is a discussion of the business of APS, our major subsidiary.

GENERAL

         APS was  incorporated  in 1920 under the laws of Arizona and is engaged
principally  in  serving  electricity  in the State of  Arizona.  The  principal
executive offices of APS are located at 400 North Fifth Street, Phoenix, Arizona
85004  (telephone  602-250-1000).  We own all of the outstanding  shares of APS'
common stock.

         APS is Arizona's largest electric utility, with 799,000 customers,  and
provides  wholesale  or retail  electric  service to the entire state of Arizona
with the  exception  of Tucson and about  one-half of the Phoenix  area.  During
1998, no single  purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than 2% of total
electric  revenues.  At December 31,  1998,  APS employed  6,075  people,  which
includes employees assigned to joint projects where APS is project manager.

COMPETITION

         RETAIL

     GENERAL. Under current law, APS is not in direct competition with any other
regulated   electric  utility  for  electric  service  in  APS'  retail  service
territory.  Nevertheless,  APS is subject to varying  degrees of  competition in
certain  territories  adjacent  to or within  areas that it serves that are also
currently served by other utilities in our region (such as Tucson Electric Power
Company,  Southwest Gas  Corporation,  and Citizens  Utility Company) as well as
cooperatives,   municipalities,  electrical  districts,  and  similar  types  of
governmental organizations (principally Salt River Project).

     APS faces  competitive  challenges  from low-cost  hydroelectric  power and
natural  gas fuel,  as well as the  access  of some  utilities  to  preferential
low-priced  federal  power and other  subsidies.  In addition,  some  customers,
particularly industrial and large commercial,  may own and operate facilities to
generate their own electric energy requirements. Such facilities may be operated
by the customers themselves or by other entities engaged for such purpose.

     ARIZONA  ELECTRIC   INDUSTRY   RESTRUCTURING.   See  Note  3  of  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in Item 8 for a discussion  of the electric
industry  restructuring in Arizona,  including ACC rules for the introduction of
retail electric  competition;  stranded cost recovery;  and Arizona  legislative
initiatives.   See  also   "Financial   Review  -   Competition   and   Industry
Restructuring" in Item 7.

     WHOLESALE

     GENERAL.   APS  competes  with  other  utilities,   power  marketers,   and
independent  power producers in the sale of electric  capacity and energy in the
wholesale  market.  APS expects that  competition  to sell  capacity will remain
vigorous.  APS' rates for wholesale  power sales and  transmission  services are
subject  to  regulation  by the FERC.  During  1998,  approximately  16% of APS'
electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and charges.

     The  National  Energy  Policy Act of 1992 (the  "Energy  Act") has promoted
increased  competition in the wholesale  electric power markets.  The Energy Act
reformed provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (the "1935
Act") and the Federal Power Act to remove certain  barriers to  competition  for
the supply of electricity. For example, the Energy Act permits the FERC to order
transmission  access  for third  parties  to  transmission  facilities  owned by
another entity so that independent suppliers and other third parties can sell at
wholesale  to  customers  wherever  located.  The Energy Act does not,  however,
permit  the FERC to  issue an order  requiring  transmission  access  to  retail
customers.


     Effective  July 9, 1996, a FERC  decision  requires all electric  utilities
subject to the FERC's  jurisdiction to file  transmission  tariffs which provide
competitors   with  access  to   transmission   facilities   comparable  to  the
transmission owners' access for wholesale transactions,  establishes information
requirements,  and provides for recovery of certain  wholesale  stranded  costs.
Retail stranded costs  resulting from a  state-authorized  retail  direct-access
program are the responsibility of the states,  unless a state lacks authority to
impose rates to recover such costs,  in which case FERC will consider  doing so.
APS has filed a revised open access tariff in accordance with this decision. APS
does not believe that this decision will have a material  adverse  impact on its
results of operations or financial position.

     REGULATORY ASSETS

     APS'  major   regulatory   assets  are  deferred   income  taxes  and  rate
synchronization  cost  deferrals.   These  items,  combined  with  miscellaneous
regulatory  assets and liabilities,  amounted to  approximately  $900 million at
December 31, 1998.  Under a 1996 regulatory  agreement,  the ACC accelerated the
amortization of  substantially  all of APS'  regulatory  assets to an eight-year
period that will end June 30,  2004.  APS'  existing  regulatory  orders and the
current  regulatory  environment  support APS' accounting  practices  related to
regulatory  assets.  If rate  recovery  of these  assets is no longer  probable,
whether due to competition or regulatory  action, APS would be required to write
off the remaining balance as an extraordinary charge to expense. This could have
a material impact on APS' financial  statements.  See Notes 1, 3, and 4 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.

     COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES

     APS  is  pursuing  strategies  to  maintain  and  enhance  its  competitive
position. These strategies include (i) cost management,  with an emphasis on the
reduction of variable costs (fuel, operations,  and maintenance expenses) and on
increased productivity through technological efficiencies;  (ii) a focus on APS'
core  business  through  customer  service,   distribution  system  reliability,
business  segmentation,  and the anticipation of market opportunities;  (iii) an
emphasis on good regulatory relationships; (iv) asset maximization (e.g., higher
capacity  factors and lower forced outage rates);  (v) expanding APS' generation
asset base to support growth in the  competitive  power  marketing  arena;  (vi)
strengthening APS' capital structure and financial  condition;  (vii) leveraging
core competencies  into related areas,  such as energy  management  products and
services;  and  (viii)  establishing  a trading  floor and  implementing  a risk
management  program to provide for more  stability  of prices and the ability to
retain or grow  incremental  margin  through more  competitive  pricing and risk
management.  Underpinning  APS'  competitive  strategies  are the strong  growth
characteristics  of APS'  service  territory.  As  competition  in the  electric
utility industry continues to evolve,  APS will continue to evaluate  strategies
and  alternatives  that  will  position  us to  compete  effectively  in a  more
competitive, restructured industry.

GENERATING FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER

     1998 ENERGY MIX

     APS'  sources of energy  during 1998 were:  coal - 36.2%;  nuclear - 27.5%;
purchased power - 32.3%; and other - 4.0%.

     COAL SUPPLY

     APS  believes  that  Cholla has  sufficient  reserves  of low  sulfur  coal
committed to the plant  through 2005. In 1998,  the current  supplier  agreed to
allow Cholla to test burn coal from other  sources,  which led to coal purchases
on the spot  market.  The  current  supplier  is expected to continue to provide
substantially all of Cholla's low sulfur coal  requirements.  APS believes there
are  sufficient  reserves of low sulfur coal  available  to allow the  continued
operation of Cholla for its useful life. APS also believes that Four Corners and
NGS have  sufficient  reserves  of low sulfur  coal  available  for use by those
plants to continue operating them for their useful lives.


     The current  sulfur  content of coal being used at Four  Corners,  NGS, and
Cholla is approximately 0.77%, 0.54%, and 0.44%, respectively.  In 1998, average
prices  paid for  coal  supplied  from the  reserves  dedicated  under  existing
contracts  were  slightly  lower,  but  still  comparable  to  1997.  Escalation
components of existing  long-term coal contracts  impact future coal prices.  In
addition,  major  price  adjustments  can occur from time to time as a result of
contract renegotiation.

     NGS and Four Corners are located on the Navajo  Reservation  and held under
easements  granted by the federal  government  as well as leases from the Navajo
Nation.  See "Properties-  Plant Sites Leased from the Navajo Nation" in Item 2.
APS purchases all of the coal which fuels Four Corners from a coal supplier with
a long-term lease of coal reserves owned by the Navajo Nation and for NGS from a
coal supplier with a long-term  lease with the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe.
Coal is supplied to Cholla from a coal  supplier who mines all of the coal under
a  long-term  lease of coal  reserves  owned by the Navajo  Nation,  the federal
government,  and  private  landholders.  See Note 12 of  Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial  Statements in Item 8 for  information  regarding APS'  obligation for
coal mine reclamation.

     NATURAL GAS SUPPLY

     APS is a party to  contracts  with a number of natural  gas  operators  and
marketers  which allow APS to purchase  natural gas in the method APS determines
to be most  economic.  Currently,  APS is purchasing the majority of its natural
gas  requirements  from 25  companies  pursuant to  contracts.  APS' natural gas
supply is transported pursuant to a firm transportation service contract with El
Paso Natural Gas Company.  APS  continues to analyze the market to determine the
most favorable source and method of meeting its natural gas requirements.

     NUCLEAR FUEL SUPPLY

     The fuel cycle for Palo Verde is comprised of the following stages:

+    the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates,
+    the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride,
+    the enrichment of uranium hexafluoride,
+    the fabrication of fuel assemblies,
+    the utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors and
+    the storage of spent fuel and the disposal thereof.

The Palo  Verde  participants  have  made  contractual  arrangements  to  obtain
quantities  of  uranium  concentrates  anticipated  to  be  sufficient  to  meet
operational  requirements  through 2001. Existing contracts and options could be
utilized to meet  approximately 93% of requirements in 2002, 62% of requirements
in 2003, 51% of requirements in 2004, and 44% of requirements  from 2005 through
2007. Spot purchases on the uranium market will be made, as appropriate, in lieu
of any uranium that might be obtained through contractual options.

     The Palo Verde participants have contracted for 85% of conversion  services
required through 2002. The Palo Verde  participants have an enrichment  services
contract  and an enriched  uranium  product  contract  that  furnish  enrichment
services  required for the operation of the three Palo Verde units through 2003.
In addition,  existing contracts will provide fuel assembly fabrication services
until at least 2003 for each Palo Verde  unit,  and  through  contract  options,
approximately fifteen additional years are available.

     SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL AND WASTE DISPOSAL. Pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act of 1982,  as amended in 1987 (the "Waste  Act"),  DOE is obligated to accept
and dispose of all spent nuclear fuel and other  high-level  radioactive  wastes
generated by all domestic power  reactors.  The NRC,  pursuant to the Waste Act,
requires  operators of nuclear power  reactors to enter into spent fuel disposal
contracts  with DOE.  APS has done so on its  behalf  and on behalf of the other
Palo Verde participants.  Under the Waste Act, DOE was to develop the facilities
necessary  for the storage and  disposal of spent  nuclear  fuel and to have the
first such  facility in operation by 1998.  That  facility was to be a permanent
repository. DOE has announced that such a repository now cannot be


completed  before 2010. In July 1996, the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) ruled that the DOE has an obligation
to start  disposing of spent nuclear fuel no later than January 31, 1998. By way
of letter dated December 17, 1996,  DOE informed APS and other contract  holders
that DOE anticipates that it will be unable to begin acceptance of spent nuclear
fuel for disposal in a  repository  or interim  storage  facility by January 31,
1998. In November  1997, the D.C.  Circuit issued a Writ of Mandamus  precluding
DOE from  excusing  its own delay on the grounds that DOE has not yet prepared a
permanent  repository  or interim  storage  facility.  On May 5, 1998,  the D.C.
Circuit  issued a ruling  refusing to order DOE to begin  moving  spent  nuclear
fuel.  On July 24,  1998,  APS  filed a  Petition  for  Review  regarding  DOE's
obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel. ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY
V. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  No. 98-1346 (D.C.  Cir.).
See "Palo Verde  Nuclear  Generating  Station" in Note 12 of Notes to  Financial
Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of interim spent fuel storage costs.

     Several  bills  have  been   introduced  in  Congress   contemplating   the
construction of a central interim storage facility; however, there is resistance
to certain features of these bills both in Congress and the Administration.

     Facility funding is a further complication. While all nuclear utilities pay
into a so-called  nuclear  waste fund an amount  calculated  on the basis of the
output of their respective plants, the annual  Congressional  appropriations for
the permanent  repository  have been for amounts less than the amounts paid into
the  waste  fund  (the  balance  of  which is being  used for  other  purposes).
According to DOE spokespersons,  the fund may now be at a level less than needed
to achieve a 2010 operational date for a permanent  repository.  No funding will
be available for a central interim facility until one is authorized by Congress.

     APS has  storage  capacity  in existing  fuel  storage  pools at Palo Verde
which,  with certain  modifications,  could  accommodate all fuel expected to be
discharged  from normal  operation of Palo Verde  through  about 2002.  APS also
believes it could augment that wet storage with new  facilities  for on-site dry
storage of spent fuel for an  indeterminate  period of  operation  beyond  2002,
subject to obtaining any required  governmental  approvals.  One way or another,
APS  currently  believes  that spent fuel  storage or disposal  methods  will be
available for use by Palo Verde to allow its continued operation beyond 2002.

     A new low-level  waste facility was built in 1995 on-site which could store
an amount of waste  equivalent  to ten years of normal  operation at Palo Verde.
Although some low-level waste has been stored on-site, APS is currently shipping
low-level  waste to off-site  facilities.  APS  currently  believes that interim
low-level  waste storage  methods are or will be available for use by Palo Verde
to allow its  continued  operation and to safely store  low-level  waste until a
permanent disposal facility is available.

     APS believes that  scientific and financial  aspects of the issues of spent
fuel and low-level  waste  storage and disposal can be resolved  satisfactorily.
However,  APS also  acknowledges  that  their  ultimate  resolution  in a timely
fashion  will  require  political  resolve and action on national  and  regional
scales which APS is less able to predict.

PURCHASED POWER AGREEMENTS

     In  addition  to that  available  from APS' own  generating  capacity  (see
"Properties"  in Item 2), APS purchases  electricity  from other utilities under
various arrangements. One of the most important of these is a long-term contract
with Salt River Project.  This contract may be canceled by Salt River Project on
three years' notice and requires Salt River Project to make  available,  and APS
to pay for,  certain amounts of electricity.  The amount of electricity is based
in large part on customer demand within certain areas now served by APS pursuant
to a related  territorial  agreement.  The generating  capacity available to APS
pursuant to the contract was 292 MW January  through May 1998, and starting June
1998  increased to 316 MW. In 1998,  APS received  approximately  943,354 MWh of
energy under the  contract and paid about $43 million for capacity  availability
and energy received.  See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements
for a discussion of amendments to agreements with Salt River Project.

     In September  1990,  APS entered into certain  agreements  with  PacifiCorp
relating  principally  to sales and  purchases  of electric  power and  electric
utility assets. In July 1991 APS sold Cholla 4 to PacifiCorp. As part of the


transaction,  PacifiCorp  agreed to make a firm  system  sale to APS for  thirty
years during our summer peak season.  The amount of the sale for the first seven
years was 175 MW and it  increases  after that at APS'  option,  up to a maximum
amount of 380 MW. APS  converted the firm system sales to  one-for-one  seasonal
capacity  exchanges with PacifiCorp on October 31, 1997. On January 1, 1999 APS'
agreements with PacifiCorp provide for 275 MW capacity exchange and beginning in
May 1999, an additional 205 MW capacity exchange begins. In 1998, APS had 275 MW
of generating  capacity  available from PacifiCorp.  APS received  approximately
281,217 MWh of energy under the exchange.

     During 1996, APS entered into an agreement with Citizens  Utilities Company
to build, own, operate,  and maintain a combustion turbine in northwest Arizona.
CUC terminated the combustion turbine project in February 1999. APS has notified
CUC that it will retain the rights to the combustion turbine project.

CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM

     During the years 1996 through 1998, APS incurred approximately $899 million
in capitalized expenditures. Utility capitalized expenditures for the years 1999
through  2001 are  expected  to be  primarily  for  expanding  transmission  and
distribution   capabilities  to  meet  customer   growth,   upgrading   existing
facilities, and for environmental purposes. Capitalized expenditures,  including
expenditures for environmental  control  facilities,  for the years 1999 through
2001 have been estimated as follows:

                              (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)
BY YEAR                                              BY MAJOR FACILITIES

                               ====              Total                      $945
                                                                            ====

     The amounts for 1999 through 2001 exclude  capitalized  interest  costs and
include  capitalized  property  taxes and about  $30-$35  million  each year for
nuclear fuel. APS conducts a continuing review of its construction  program. APS
is considering  expanding certain of its operations over the next several years,
which may result in additional  expenditures.  APS currently believes that there
will be opportunities to expand its investment in generating  assets in the next
five years. It is expected that these generating  assets would be organized in a
newly-created, non-regulated affiliate under us.

MORTGAGE REPLACEMENT FUND REQUIREMENTS

     So  long  as any of APS'  first  mortgage  bonds  are  outstanding,  APS is
required for each  calendar  year to deposit with the trustee under its Mortgage
cash in a formularized amount related to net additions to APS' mortgaged utility
plant. APS may satisfy all or any part of this "replacement fund" requirement by
utilizing  redeemed  or retired  bonds,  net  property  additions,  or  property
retirements.   For  1998,  the   replacement   fund   requirement   amounted  to
approximately  $138  million.  Certain  of the  bonds APS has  issued  under the
Mortgage that are callable  prior to maturity are  redeemable at their par value
plus accrued  interest with cash APS deposits in the  replacement  fund. This is
subject  in many cases to a period of time after the  original  issuance  of the
bonds during which they may not be so redeemed.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     EPA ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

     CLEAN AIR ACT. APS is subject to a number of  requirements  under the Clean
Air Act.  Pursuant to the 1977  amendments to the Clean Air Act, the EPA adopted
regulations that address  visibility  impairment in certain  federally-protected
areas which can be reasonably attributed to specific sources. In September 1991,
the EPA issued a final rule that limited  sulfur  dioxide  emissions at NGS. One
NGS unit had to comply with this rule in 1997, one in 1998, and the last unit in
1999. Salt River Project is the NGS operating agent. Salt River Project


estimates a capital cost of $430 million and annual  operations and  maintenance
costs of  approximately  $14 million for all three units,  for NGS to meet these
requirements.  APS is required to fund 14% of these expenditures.  Approximately
93% of these capital costs have been incurred through 1998.

     The Clean Air Act  Amendments  of 1990 (the  "Amendments")  address,  among
other things:

+    "acid rain,"
+    visibility in certain specified areas,
+    hazardous air pollutants and
+    areas that have not attained national ambient air quality standards.

With respect to "acid rain," the Amendments establish a system of sulfur dioxide
emissions  "allowances."  Each existing utility unit is granted a certain number
of "allowances." For Phase II plants, which include APS' plants, allowances will
be required  beginning in the year 2000 to operate the plants. On March 5, 1993,
the EPA  promulgated  rules  listing  allowance  allocations  applicable to APS'
plants.  Based on those  allocations,  APS will have  sufficient  allowances  to
permit  continued  operation of its plants at current levels without  installing
additional equipment.

     In  addition,  the  Amendments  require  the  EPA  to set  nitrogen  oxides
emissions  limitations.  These  limitations  require  certain  plants to install
additional  pollution control equipment.  In December 1996, the EPA issued rules
for  nitrogen  oxides  emissions  limitations  that may  require  APS to install
additional  pollution  control  equipment at Four Corners by January 1, 2000. On
February 14, 1997, APS filed a Petition for Review in the United States Court of
Appeals  for the  District of  Columbia.  APS  alleged  that the EPA  improperly
classified  Four Corners Unit 4 in these rules,  thereby  subjecting Unit 4 to a
more stringent  emission  limitation.  ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE  COMPANY V. UNITED
STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, No. 97-1091. In February 1998, the Court
vacated  the  Unit 4  emission  limitation  and  remanded  the  issue to EPA for
reconsideration. APS cannot currently predict how the EPA will respond. However,
based on APS' initial  evaluation,  APS currently  estimates its capital cost of
complying with the rules may be approximately $4 million.

     With respect to protection of visibility in certain  specified  areas,  the
Amendments require the EPA to conduct a study concerning  visibility  impairment
in those areas and to identify sources contributing to such impairment.  Interim
findings of this study  indicate that any  beneficial  effect on visibility as a
result of the  Amendments  would be offset by expected  population  and industry
growth.  The Amendments also require EPA to establish a "Grand Canyon Visibility
Transport  Commission"  to  complete  a study on  visibility  impairment  in the
"Golden Circle of National Parks" in the Colorado Plateau. NGS, Cholla, and Four
Corners are located near the Golden  Circle of National  Parks.  The  Commission
completed its study and on June 10, 1996 submitted its final  recommendations to
the EPA. The Commission  recommended  that,  beginning in 2000 and every 5 years
thereafter, if actual sulfur dioxide emissions from all stationary sources in an
eight-state region (including Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, and California)
exceed the projected emissions, which are projected to decline under the current
regulatory  scheme, the projected total emissions will be changed to a "regional
emissions  cap" and an emissions  trading  program would be implemented to limit
total  sulfur  dioxide  emissions  in the region.  The EPA will  consider  these
recommendations  before  promulgating  final  requirements  on a  regional  haze
regulatory  program which the EPA proposed in July 1997 and which is expected to
be finalized by mid-1999.

     Under EPA's  proposed  regional haze  program,  states would be required to
submit plans to meet  "presumptive  reasonable  progress  targets" for achieving
perceptible  improvements  in  visibility  conditions  in Federal  Class I areas
(e.g.,  national parks) every 10-15 years. The proposal also calls for states to
conduct three year "best  available  retrofit  technology"  ("BART")  reviews on
point  sources  which  became  operational  between  1962 and 1977 and which may
normally be anticipated to contribute to regional haze visibility impairment.

     Also, in July 1997,  EPA  promulgated  final  National  Ambient Air Quality
Standards for ozone and  particulate  matter.  Pursuant to the rules,  the ozone
standard is more  stringent and a new ambient  standard for very fine  particles
has been  established.  Congress  has enacted  legislation  that could delay the
implementation of regional


haze  requirements  and the  particulate  matter ambient  standard.  Because the
actual level of emissions controls, if any, for any unit cannot be determined at
this time, APS currently cannot estimate the capital expenditures, if any, which
would result from the final rules.  However, APS does not currently expect these
rules to have a material adverse effect on its financial  position or results of
operations.

     With respect to hazardous air pollutants  emitted by electric utility steam
generating units, the Amendments  require two studies.  The results of the first
study  indicated  an impact from  mercury  emissions  from such units in certain
unspecified  areas. The EPA has not yet stated whether or not mercury  emissions
limitations will be imposed.  Secondly, the EPA will complete a general study in
the next several years  concerning  the  necessity of  regulating  hazardous air
pollutant  emissions  from such units under the  Amendments.  Because APS cannot
speculate  as to the  ultimate  requirements  by the EPA,  APS cannot  currently
estimate the capital expenditures,  if any, which may be required as a result of
these studies.

     Certain aspects of the Amendments may require related  expenditures by APS,
such as permit fees. APS does not expect any of these to have a material  impact
on its financial position or results of operations.

     SUPERFUND.  The Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,  Compensation,  and
Liability Act ("Superfund")  establishes  liability for the cleanup of hazardous
substances  found  contaminating  the soil,  water, or air. Those who generated,
transported,  or disposed of hazardous  substances  at a  contaminated  site are
among  those  who are  potentially  responsible  parties  ("PRPs").  PRPs may be
strictly, and often jointly and severally,  liable for the cost of any necessary
remediation of the substances.  The EPA had previously  advised APS that the EPA
considers APS to be a PRP in the Indian Bend Wash  Superfund  Site,  South Area.
APS'  Ocotillo  Power  Plant is located in this area.  APS is in the  process of
conducting an  investigation  to determine the extent and scope of contamination
at the  plant  site.  Based  on the  information  to date,  including  available
insurance  coverage  and an EPA estimate of cleanup  costs,  APS does not expect
this matter to have a material  impact on its  financial  position or results of
operations.

     MANUFACTURED  GAS PLANT SITES.  APS is currently  investigating  properties
which  APS now owns or  which  were at one  time  owned by APS or its  corporate
predecessor,  that  were  at one  time  sites  of,  or  sites  associated  with,
manufactured gas plants. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if:

+    waste materials are present
+    such materials constitute an environmental or health risk and
+    APS has any responsibility for remedial action.

Where appropriate, APS has begun remediation of certain of these sites. APS does
not expect  these  matters to have a material  adverse  effect on its  financial
position or results of operations.

     PURPORTED NAVAJO ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

     Four  Corners  and NGS are located on the Navajo  Reservation  and are held
under  easements  granted by the federal  government  as well as leases from the
Navajo Nation. APS is the Four Corners operating agent. APS owns a 100% interest
in Four Corners  Units 1, 2, and 3, and a 15%  interest in Four Corners  Units 4
and 5. APS owns a 14% interest in NGS Units 1, 2, and 3.

     In July 1995,  the Navajo  Nation  enacted the Navajo  Nation Air Pollution
Prevention  and Control Act, the Navajo Nation Safe Drinking  Water Act, and the
Navajo Nation Pesticide Act  (collectively,  the "Acts").  Pursuant to the Acts,
the Navajo Nation  Environmental  Protection  Agency is authorized to promulgate
regulations  covering air quality,  drinking  water,  and pesticide  activities,
including  those that occur at Four Corners and NGS. By separate  letters  dated
October 12 and October  13,  1995,  the Four  Corners  participants  and the NGS
participants  requested the United  States  Secretary of the Interior to resolve
their dispute with the Navajo Nation regarding  whether or not the Acts apply to
operations of Four Corners and NGS. On October 17, 1995, the Four Corners


participants and the NGS participants each filed a lawsuit in the District Court
of the Navajo  Nation,  Window Rock  District,  seeking,  among other things,  a
declaratory judgment that

+    their respective leases and federal  easements  preclude the application of
     the Acts to the operations of Four Corners and NGS and

+    the  Navajo   Nation  and  its  agencies   and  courts  lack   adjudicatory
     jurisdiction to determine the enforceability of the Acts as applied to Four
     Corners and NGS.

On October 18, 1995, the Navajo Nation and the Four Corners and NGS participants
agreed to indefinitely stay these proceedings so that the parties may attempt to
resolve the dispute without litigation.  The Secretary and the Court have stayed
these  proceedings  pursuant to a request by the parties.  APS cannot  currently
predict the outcome of this matter.

     In  February  1998,  the  EPA  promulgated   regulations  specifying  those
provisions  of the  Clean Air Act for which it is  appropriate  to treat  Indian
tribes in the same manner as states. The EPA indicated that it believes that the
Clean Air Act generally would supersede pre-existing binding agreements that may
limit the scope of tribal  authority over  reservations.  On April 10, 1998, APS
filed a  Petition  for  Review in the United  States  Court of  Appeals  for the
District  of  Columbia.   ARIZONA  PUBLIC  SERVICE   COMPANY  V.  UNITED  STATES
ENVIRONMENTAL  PROTECTION  AGENCY,  No.  98-1196.  On February 19, 1999, the EPA
promulgated  regulations  setting  forth the EPA's  approach to issuing  Federal
operating permits to covered stationary sources on Indian reservations, pursuant
to the Amendments. APS is currently evaluating the impact of these regulations.

WATER SUPPLY

     Assured supplies of water are important for APS' generating  plants. At the
present time,  APS has adequate  water to meet its needs.  However,  conflicting
claims to  limited  amounts  of water in the  southwestern  United  States  have
resulted in numerous court actions in recent years.

     Both  groundwater  and surface water in areas  important to APS' operations
have been the subject of inquiries,  claims,  and legal  proceedings  which will
require a number of years to  resolve.  APS is one of a number of  parties  in a
proceeding  before a state court in New Mexico to adjudicate  rights to a stream
system from which water for Four  Corners is derived.  (STATE OF NEW MEXICO,  IN
THE RELATION OF S.E. REYNOLDS, STATE ENGINEER VS. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, CITY
OF FARMINGTON,  UTAH  INTERNATIONAL,  INC., ET AL., San Juan County, New Mexico,
District Court No. 75-184). An agreement reached with the Navajo Nation in 1985,
however,  provides  that if Four  Corners  loses a portion  of its rights in the
adjudication,  the Navajo  Nation will  provide,  for a  then-agreed  upon cost,
sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss.

     A summons  served on APS in early 1986 required all water  claimants in the
Lower Gila River Watershed in Arizona to assert any claims to water on or before
January 20, 1987, in an action pending in Maricopa County Superior Court. (IN RE
THE GENERAL ADJUDICATION OF ALL RIGHTS TO USE WATER IN THE GILA RIVER SYSTEM AND
SOURCE,  Supreme Court Nos. WC-79-0001 through WC 79-0004  (Consolidated) [WC-1,
WC-2, WC-3 and WC-4 (Consolidated)],  Maricopa County Nos. W-1, W-2, W-3 and W-4
(Consolidated)). Palo Verde is located within the geographic area subject to the
summons. APS' rights and the rights of the Palo Verde participants to the use of
groundwater  and effluent at Palo Verde is  potentially at issue in this action.
As project  manager of Palo Verde,  APS filed  claims  that  dispute the court's
jurisdiction  over the Palo  Verde  participants'  groundwater  rights and their
contractual rights to effluent relating to Palo Verde. Alternatively,  APS seeks
confirmation of such rights.  Three of APS' less-utilized  power plants are also
located within the geographic  area subject to the summons.  APS' claims dispute
the court's  jurisdiction  over APS'  groundwater  rights with  respect to these
plants.  Alternatively,  APS seeks confirmation of such rights. Issues important
to the claims are pending on appeal to the Arizona  Supreme Court. No trial date
concerning APS' water rights claims has been set in this matter.

     APS has also filed claims to water in the Little  Colorado River  Watershed
in Arizona in an action pending in the Apache County Superior Court.  (IN RE THE
GENERAL ADJUDICATION OF ALL RIGHTS TO USE WATER IN THE LITTLE


COLORADO  RIVER SYSTEM AND SOURCE,  Supreme Court No.  WC-79-0006  WC-6,  Apache
County No. 6417).  APS'  groundwater  resource  utilized at Cholla is within the
geographic  area subject to the  adjudication  and is therefore  potentially  at
issue in the case.  APS'  claims  dispute  the  court's  jurisdiction  over APS'
groundwater  rights.  Alternatively,  APS seeks confirmation of such rights. The
parties  are in the  process of  settlement  negotiations  with  respect to this
matter.  No trial date  concerning APS' water rights claims has been set in this
matter.

     Although the foregoing  matters remain subject to further  evaluation,  APS
expects that the described litigation will not have a material adverse impact on
its financial position or results of operations.

                     BUSINESS OF SUNCOR DEVELOPMENT COMPANY

         SunCor was  incorporated in 1965 under the laws of the State of Arizona
and is engaged primarily in the acquisition,  ownership, development, operation,
and sale of land  and  other  real  property,  including  homes  and  commercial
buildings.  The principal  executive offices of SunCor are located at 3838 North
Central, Suite 1500, Phoenix, Arizona 85012 (telephone 602-285-6800). SunCor and
its  subsidiaries,  excluding  SunCor Resort & Golf  Management,  Inc.  ("Resort
Management"), employ approximately 140 persons. Resort Management, which manages
the Wigwam Resort and Country Club (the  "Wigwam"),  employs between 620 and 750
persons at the Wigwam,  depending on the Wigwam's operating season. In addition,
Resort  Management   operates  three  golf  courses  and  family   entertainment
operations which together employ about 300 people.

         Effective January 1, 1996,  SunCor's  homebuilding  subsidiary,  SunCor
Homes,  Inc.,  purchased  the assets of Golden  Heritage  Homes.  Subsequent  to
December 31, 1996, SunCor Homes, Inc. changed its name to Golden Heritage Homes,
Inc.

         SunCor's  projects consist primarily of land and improvements and other
real estate  investments.  SunCor's major asset is the Palm Valley project which
consists  of over  9,000  acres and is  located  west of  Phoenix in the area of
Goodyear/Litchfield  Park,  Arizona  ("Palm  Valley").  SunCor has completed the
master plan for developing Palm Valley.  There has been significant  residential
and commercial development at Palm Valley by SunCor and by other developers that
have  acquired  land from SunCor or entered  into joint  ventures  with  SunCor.
Development at Palm Valley currently includes residential communities, including
a retirement community, with golf courses, hotels,  restaurants,  commercial and
retail outlets, hospitals, and assisted-care facilities.

         Other SunCor projects under  development  include seven  master-planned
communities and four commercial projects.  The four commercial projects and four
of the  master-planned  communities  are  located  in the  Phoenix  area.  Other
master-planned  communities are located near Sedona,  Arizona,  near St. George,
Utah, and near Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Several of the  master-plan and commercial
projects  are joint  ventures  with other  developers,  financial  partners,  or
landowners.

         For the past three years, SunCor's operating revenues were about: 1998,
$124.2 million;  1997, $116.5 million;  and 1996, $99.5 million.  For those same
periods SunCor's net income was about: 1998, $44.7 million;  1997, $5.3 million;
and 1996,  $4.2  million.  About  $37.2  million  of  SunCor's  1998 net  income
represents  income  related  to the  recognition  of a deferred  tax asset.  The
deferred  tax  asset  relates  to  net  operating   losses  and  book/tax  basis
differences.  SunCor is expected to realize these benefits in subsequent periods
pursuant to an intercompany tax allocation  agreement.  On a consolidated basis,
there was no impact to consolidated  net income.  SunCor's capital needs consist
primarily of capital expenditures for land development and home construction. On
the basis of projects now under  development,  SunCor expects capital needs over
the next three years to be: 1999, $58 million;  2000, $53 million; and 2001, $43
million.

         At December  31, 1998,  SunCor had total assets of about $407  million.
See Note 6 of  Notes  to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in Item 8 for
information  regarding  SunCor's  long-term debt. SunCor intends to continue its
focus  on  real  estate  development  in  homebuilding  and the  development  of
residential, commercial, and industrial projects.


                    BUSINESS OF EL DORADO DEVELOPMENT COMPANY

         El  Dorado  was  incorporated  in 1983  under  the laws of the State of
Arizona and is engaged  principally in the business of making equity investments
in other  companies.  El  Dorado's  short-term  goal is to convert  its  venture
capital  portfolio to cash as quickly and as  advantageously  as possible.  On a
long-term basis, we may use El Dorado,  when appropriate,  as our subsidiary for
new  ventures  that  are  strategically  close  to  our  principal  business  of
generating,  distributing,  and marketing  electricity.  El Dorado's offices are
located  at 400 East  Van  Buren  Street,  Suite  750,  Phoenix,  Arizona  85004
(telephone 602-379-2662).

         El Dorado had  investments  in venture  capital  partnerships  totaling
approximately  $7 million at December  31,  1998.  In addition to the  foregoing
investments,  at  December  31,  1998,  El  Dorado  had  direct  investments  of
approximately   $17  million  in  other   private  and  public   companies   and
partnerships.  These investments include a 56% interest in NAC International,  a
company  that  specializes  in nuclear  spent fuel  storage  and  transportation
technology,  as well as  nuclear  fuel  cycle and  international  energy  policy
consulting.

         For the past three  years,  El  Dorado's  net income  was:  1998,  $4.5
million;  1997, $8.2 million;  and 1996, $0.4 million.  At December 31, 1998, El
Dorado had total assets of about $27 million.

RESERVE MARGIN

     APS' peak one-hour  demand on its electric  system was recorded on July 16,
1998 at  5,072,000  kW,  compared to the 1997 peak of  4,608,600  kW recorded on
August 22. Taking into account  additional  capacity then available to APS under
purchase  power  contracts  as  well  as  APS'  own  generating  capacity,  APS'
capability  of meeting  system  demand on July 16, 1998,  computed in accordance
with  accepted  industry  practices,  amounted to 5,139,600 kW, for an installed
reserve margin of 3.1%.  The power actually  available to APS from its resources
fluctuates  from  time to time  due in part to  planned  outages  and  technical
problems.  The available  capacity from sources actually operable at the time of
the 1998 peak amounted to 4,862,600 kW, for a margin of (3.9%).  Firm  purchases
from neighboring  utilities  totaling  1,467,000 kW were in place at the time of
the peak  ensuring  the  ability  to meet the load  requirement,  with an actual
reserve margin of 7.4%.


PLANT SITES LEASED FROM NAVAJO NATION

     NGS and Four  Corners  are  located on land held under  easements  from the
federal  government  and also under  leases  from the Navajo  Nation.  We do not
believe that the risk with respect to enforcement of these  easements and leases
is material.  The lease for Four Corners waives until 2001 the requirement  that
APS, as well as its fuel supplier,  pay certain taxes to the Navajo  Nation.  In
September 1997, a settlement  agreement was finalized  between the coal supplier
to Four Corners,  the Navajo Nation, and APS which settled certain issues in the
Four Corners lease  regarding  the  obligation of the fuel supplier to pay taxes
prior to the expiration of tax waivers in 2001.  Pursuant to the  agreement,  in
1997 APS recognized  approximately  $14 million of pretax earnings  related to a
partial  refund of  possessory  interest  taxes paid by the fuel  supplier.  The
parties also agreed to renegotiate their business relationship before 2001 in an
effort  to  permit  the  electricity  generated  at Four  Corners  to be  priced
competitively.  APS cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter. Certain
of APS'  transmission  lines and almost all of its  contracted  coal sources are
also located on Indian reservations. See "Generating Fuel and Purchased Power --
Coal Supply" in Item 1.

PALO VERDE NUCLEAR GENERATING STATION

     PALO VERDE LEASES

     See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements in Item 8 for a
discussion of three sale and leaseback  transactions  related to Palo Verde Unit
2.

     REGULATORY

     Operation  of each of the three  Palo Verde  units  requires  an  operating
license from the NRC. The NRC issued full power operating licenses for Unit 1 in
June 1985,  Unit 2 in April 1986,  and Unit 3 in November  1987.  The full power
operating licenses, each valid for a period of approximately 40 years, authorize
APS, as operating agent for Palo Verde, to operate the three Palo Verde units at
full power.

     NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING COSTS

     The NRC recently amended its rules on financial assurance  requirements for
the  decommissioning of nuclear power plants. The amended rules became effective
on November  23,  1998.  The amended  rules  provide  that a licensee may use an
external  sinking fund as the  exclusive  financial  assurance  mechanism if the
licensee recovers estimated total  decommissioning costs through cost of service
rates or through a  "non-bypassable  charge." Other  mechanisms are  prescribed,
including prepayment, if the requirements for exclusive reliance on the external
sinking fund mechanism are not met. APS currently relies on the external sinking
fund  mechanism  to  meet  the  NRC  financial  assurance  requirements  for its
interests  in Palo Verde  Units 1, 2, and 3. The  decommissioning  costs of Palo
Verde  Units 1, 2, and 3 are  currently  included in ACC  jurisdictional  rates.
Proposed ACC rules regarding the introduction of retail electric  competition in
Arizona  (see Note 3)  currently  provide  that  decommissioning  costs would be
recovered through a non-bypassable  "system benefits" charge,  which would allow
APS to maintain its external  sinking  fund  mechanism.  See Note 13 of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements in Item 8 for additional  information  about
nuclear decommissioning costs.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL REVIEW

In this  section,  we explain  the  results  of  operations,  general  financial
condition, and outlook for Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries:  APS, SunCor, and
El Dorado, including:

+    the changes in our earnings from 1997 to 1998 and from 1996 to 1997
+    the factors  impacting our  business,  including  competition  and electric
     industry restructuring
+    the  effects of  regulatory  agreements  on our  results  and outlook 
+    our  capital  needs  and  resources  - both  for APS  and  our  non-utility
     operations and
+    Year 2000 technology issues.

Throughout this Financial  Review,  we refer to specific "Notes" in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements that begin on page 37. These Notes add further
details to the discussion.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1998  COMPARED  WITH 1997 Our 1998  consolidated  net income was $242.9  million
compared with $235.9 million in 1997 - a 3.0% increase.  Net income increased by
$7.0 million  primarily  because of increased  earnings at the  subsidiaries and
lower  financing costs as we paid down debt and took advantage of lower interest
rates.

APS' 1998 earnings increased $6.9 million - a 2.9% increase - over 1997 earnings
primarily  because of an increase in  customers,  expanded  power  marketing and
trading activities, and lower financing costs. In the comparison, these positive
factors  more than  offset  the  effects  of milder  weather,  two  fuel-related
settlements  recorded in 1997, and two retail price  reductions.  See Note 3 for
additional information about the price reductions.

In 1998,  electric  operating  revenues increased $128 million primarily because
of:

+    increased power marketing and trading revenues ($94 million)
+    increases in the number of customers and the amount of electricity  used by
     customers ($77 million) and
+    miscellaneous factors ($8 million).

As mentioned above,  these positive factors were partially offset by the effects
of milder weather ($33 million) and reductions in retail prices ($18 million).

Power marketing and trading activities are predominantly  short-term opportunity
wholesale sales. The increase in power marketing  revenues  resulted from higher
prices, increased activity in Western bulk power markets, and increased sales to
large  customers  in  California.  The increase in power  marketing  and trading
revenues was accompanied by related increases in purchased power expenses.

The two  fuel-related  settlements  increased 1997 pretax  earnings by about $21
million.  The income statement  reflects these settlements as reductions in fuel
expense and as other income.

Operations and  maintenance  expense  increased $15 million  because of customer
growth, initiatives related to competition, and expansion of our power marketing
and trading function.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $11 million because APS had more
plant in service.

APS  decreased  its  financing  costs by $9 million  primarily  because of lower
amounts of outstanding debt and preferred stock.

Our real estate subsidiary,  SunCor Development,  and our investment subsidiary,
El Dorado,  contributed a combined $12.0 million to  consolidated  net income in
1998 compared with $13.5 million in 1997. SunCor's  contribution  increased $2.2
million as a result of an  increase  in land  sales.  El  Dorado's  contribution
decreased $3.7 million as a result of a decrease in investment sales.

SunCor's  stand-alone  net  income was $44.7  million,  of which  $37.2  million
represents  income  related  to the  recognition  of a deferred  tax asset.  The
deferred  tax  asset  relates  to  net  operating   losses  and  book/tax  basis
differences.  SunCor is expected to realize these benefits in subsequent periods
pursuant to an intercompany tax allocation  agreement.  On a consolidated basis,
Pinnacle West had already recognized the income tax benefits,  therefore,  there
was no impact on consolidated net income in 1998.


1997 COMPARED WITH 1996
Our 1997 consolidated net income was $235.9 million compared with $181.2 million
in 1996. The following is a summary:

Net income                                             $235,856       $ 181,180
                                                       ========       =========

Our earnings from  continuing  operations  increased  from 1996 to 1997 by $24.8
million,  or 11.7%,  primarily because of increased earnings at the subsidiaries
and  lower  financing  costs as we paid down  debt and took  advantage  of lower
interest rates. The 1996 loss from discontinued  operations  related to remnants
of MeraBank legal matters.

APS'  1997  earnings  increased  $12.3  million  - a 5.4%  increase  - over 1996
earnings primarily because of:

+    an increase in customers
+    a $32 million pretax charge in 1996 for a voluntary severance program
+    two fuel-related settlements in 1997 and
+    lower financing costs.

These  positive  factors  more than  offset the  effects of the 1996  regulatory
agreement  with the Arizona  Corporation  Commission  (ACC),  which  during 1997
resulted in about $60 million of additional  regulatory asset amortization and a
$35 million revenue decrease caused by two retail price  reductions.  See Note 3
and  "Results  of  Operations  -  Regulatory  Agreements"  below for  additional
information.  In addition,  APS recognized $12 million of income tax benefits in
1996 that were not repeated in 1997.

In 1997,  electric  operating  revenues increased $160 million primarily because
of:

+    increased power marketing revenues ($128 million)
+    an increase in the number of customers ($58 million) and
+    weather effects ($7 million).

As  mentioned  above,  these  positive  factors were  partially  offset by a $35
million  revenue  decrease  caused by retail price  reductions.  The increase in
power marketing  revenues resulted from increased activity in Western bulk power
markets. This did not significantly affect our earnings because the increase was
substantially offset by higher purchased power expenses.

Two  fuel-related  settlements  in 1997 increased  pretax  earnings by about $21
million.  The income  statement  shows these  settlements  as reductions in fuel
expense and as other  income.  About $16 million of the  settlements  related to
years prior to 1997 and $5 million related to 1997. APS expects the total annual
savings from the settlements for at least the next several years to be about $10
million before income taxes. APS does not have a fuel adjustment  clause as part
of its  retail  rate  structure.  As a  result,  APS shows  changes  in fuel and
purchased power expenses in current earnings.

APS lowered its operations and maintenance  expenses in 1997 by putting in place
a voluntary  severance  program in late 1996, with related savings  reflected in
1997. These savings were partially  offset by increased  expenses for marketing,
information technology, and power plant maintenance.

APS  decreased its  financing  costs by $12 million  during 1997 by lowering the
amounts of outstanding debt and preferred stock.

SunCor  Development  and El Dorado  contributed  a  combined  $13.5  million  to
consolidated  net income in 1997  compared  with $4.6 million in 1996.  SunCor's
contribution increased as a result of increased land and home sales. El Dorado's
contribution increased as a result of an increase in investment sales.


REGULATORY AGREEMENTS

Regulatory  agreements with the ACC affect the results of APS'  operations.  The
following  discussion focuses on two agreements:  a 1996 agreement to accelerate
the  amortization of APS' regulatory  assets and a 1994 settlement to accelerate
amortization of APS' deferred investment tax credits (ITCs).

Under the 1996  agreement with the ACC, APS is recovering  substantially  all of
its present regulatory assets through accelerated amortization.  The recovery of
these  assets is taking place over an  eight-year  period that will end June 30,
2004.  For more details,  see Note 3. This  accelerated  amortization  increased
annual  amortization  expense by  approximately  $120 million ($72 million after
taxes).

Also, as part of the 1996 regulatory agreement, APS reduced its retail prices by
3.4%  effective  July 1,  1996.  This  reduces  revenue by about  $48.5  million
annually ($29 million after taxes). APS also agreed to share future cost savings
with its  customers,  which  resulted in the following  additional  retail price
reductions:

+    $17.6  million  annually  ($10.5  million  after  income  taxes),  or 1.2%,
     effective July 1, 1997, and
+    $17 million annually ($10 million after income taxes),  or 1.1%,  effective
     July 1, 1998.

APS  expects  to  file  with  the ACC  for  another  retail  price  decrease  of
approximately $10.8 million annually ($6.5 million after income taxes) to become
effective  July 1, 1999. The amount and timing of the price decrease are subject
to ACC approval.  This will be the last price decrease under the 1996 regulatory
agreement.

We discuss  above,  in "Results  of  Operations,"  the  factors  that offset the
earnings impact of the accelerated  regulatory asset  amortization and the price
decreases.

As  part  of  the  1994  rate  settlement,   APS  accelerated   amortization  of
substantially all deferred investment tax credits (ITCs) over a five-year period
that ends on December  31,  1999.  The  amortization  of ITCs  decreases  annual
consolidated income tax expense by approximately $24 million. Beginning in 2000,
no further benefits will be reflected in income tax expense. See Note 4.

CAPITAL NEEDS AND RESOURCES

PINNACLE WEST (PARENT COMPANY)

We have  reduced  our debt over the last  three  years as  follows:  1998,  $113
million;  1997, $45 million;  and 1996, $60 million. We have a $250 million line
of credit, under which we had $42 million of borrowings  outstanding at December
31, 1998. We do not have any debt repayment obligations until 2001.

During the past three years, our primary cash needs were for:

+    dividends for our shareholders
+    interest payments and
+    optional and mandatory repayment of principal on our long-term debt.

In addition, as part of the 1996 agreement with the ACC, we invested $50 million
in APS in 1998,  1997,  and 1996 and will invest the same  amount in 1999.  This
will be the last payment under the 1996 regulatory agreement. See Note 3. During
1997,  we  repurchased  $80  million  of  common  stock,   reducing  our  shares
outstanding at year-end by 2.7 million shares.

Our primary  source of cash is from APS  dividends.  During 1998,  APS paid $170
million in dividends. In 1998, SunCor provided cash of $30 million and El Dorado
provided cash of $12 million.  We expect both SunCor and El Dorado to contribute
to our cash flow in 1999.  Tax  allocation  payments from our  subsidiaries,  in
excess of payments we made to taxing  authorities,  were an additional source of
cash in 1998,  1997,  and 1996.  This is not expected to be a source of cash for
Pinnacle West in the future.

APS

APS' capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and optional
and mandatory  redemptions of long-term debt and preferred  stock.  APS pays for
its capital requirements with:

+    cash from operations
+    annual cash payments from Pinnacle West of $50 million annually from 1996
     through 1999 (see Note 3) and
+    to the extent necessary, external financing.


During  the  period  from 1996  through  1998,  APS paid for all of its  capital
expenditures  with cash from  operations.  APS expects to do so in 1999  through
2001, as well.

APS' capital  expenditures  in 1998 were $327 million.  APS'  projected  capital
expenditures  for the next three  years are:  1999,  $328  million;  2000,  $317
million;  and 2001,  $300 million.  These amounts  include about $30-$35 million
each  year  for  nuclear  fuel.  In  general,  most  of  the  projected  capital
expenditures are for:

+    expanding transmission and distribution capabilities to meet customer
     growth
+    upgrading existing utility property and
+    environmental purposes.

In addition,  APS is considering  expanding  certain of its operations  over the
next several years, which may result in additional  expenditures.  APS currently
believes that there will be opportunities to expand its investment in generating
assets in the next five years. It is expected that these generating assets would
be organized in a newly created non-regulated affiliate under the parent.

During 1998,  APS redeemed  about $145 million of long-term debt and $76 million
of preferred stock, including premiums,  with cash from operations and long- and
short-term debt. APS' long-term debt and preferred stock redemption requirements
and payment  obligations  on a  capitalized  lease for the next three years are:
1999, $260 million;  2000, $115 million; and 2001, $2 million. On March 1, 1999,
APS redeemed all $95 million of its outstanding preferred stock. Based on market
conditions and optional call  provisions,  APS may make optional  redemptions of
long-term debt from time to time.

As of December 31, 1998, APS had credit commitments from various banks totalling
about $400  million,  which were  available  either to support  the  issuance of
commercial paper or to be used as bank  borrowings.  At the end of 1998, APS had
about $179  million of  commercial  paper and $125  million  of  long-term  bank
borrowings outstanding.

In 1998,  APS issued $100 million of  unsecured  long- term debt and in February
1999, APS issued $125 million of unsecured long-term debt.

Although  provisions  in  APS'  first  mortgage  bond  indenture,   articles  of
incorporation,  and ACC financing orders establish maximum amounts of additional
first  mortgage  bonds  that APS may  issue,  APS does not  expect  any of these
provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements.

NON-UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES

During the past three years,  SunCor and El Dorado each funded all of their cash
requirements with cash from operations and their own financing.

SunCor's  capital  needs  consist  primarily  of capital  expenditures  for land
development  and  home  construction.   On  the  basis  of  projects  now  under
development, SunCor expects capital needs over the next three years to be: 1999,
$58 million; 2000, $53 million; and 2001, $43 million. Capital resources to meet
these  requirements  include  funds from  operations  and  SunCor's own external
financings.

As of December  31, 1998,  SunCor had a $55 million line of credit,  under which
$38 million of borrowings were outstanding. SunCor's debt repayment requirements
for the next three years are: 1999, $4 million; 2000, $26 million; and 2001, $51
million.

COMPETITION AND INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING

The  electric  industry  is  undergoing  significant  change.  It is moving to a
competitive,   market-based   structure  from  a  highly-regulated,   cost-based
environment in which  companies have been entitled to recover their costs and to
earn fair returns on their invested capital in exchange for commitments to serve
all customers within designated service  territories.  In December 1996, the ACC
adopted rules that provide a framework for the  introduction  of retail electric
competition  in Arizona and adopted  amendments  to the rules in August 1998. On
January 11,  1999,  the ACC issued an order which  stayed the amended  rules and
granted  waivers  from  compliance  with  the  rules to all  affected  utilities
(including APS) pending further ACC decisions.  On February 5, 1999, ACC hearing
officers  issued  recommendations  for  changes  to  the  amended  rules.  These
recommended  changes were further amended by an ACC Procedural Order dated March
12,  1999.  See Note 3 for  additional  information  about these rules and other
competitive  developments,  including  an  agreement  with  Salt  River  Project
Agricultural  Improvement  and Power  District (Salt River  Project).  We cannot
currently


predict when or if the amended rules will be further modified,  when the stay of
the amended rules will be lifted,  or when retail electric  competition  will be
introduced in Arizona with respect to affected utilities.

The rules as recommended indicate that the ACC will allow affected utilities the
opportunity to fully recover  unmitigated  stranded costs,  but do not set forth
the mechanisms for  determining and recovering such costs. On June 22, 1998, the
ACC issued an order on stranded cost  determination and recovery and on February
5, 1999, an ACC hearing officer issued recommended  changes to that order. These
recommended  changes were further amended by an ACC Procedural Order dated March
12, 1999. See Note 3 for additional information on proposed modifications to the
stranded cost order.

An Arizona joint legislative  committee  studied electric utility  restructuring
issues  in  1996  and  1997.  In May  1998,  a law  was  enacted  to  facilitate
implementation  of  retail  electric  competition  in the  state.  Additionally,
legislation  related to  electric  competition  has been  proposed in the United
States Congress. See Note 3 for a discussion of legislative developments.

We believe that further ACC  decisions,  legislation  at the Arizona and federal
levels,  and perhaps  amendments to the Arizona  Constitution will ultimately be
required before  significant  implementation of retail electric  competition can
lawfully occur in Arizona.  Until it has been determined how competition will be
implemented  in Arizona,  including the manner in which  stranded  costs will be
addressed, we cannot accurately predict the impact of full retail competition on
our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.  As competition in
the  electric  industry  continues  to  evolve,  we will  continue  to  evaluate
strategies and  alternatives  that will position us to compete  effectively in a
restructured industry.

APS prepares its financial  statements in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types
of Regulation." SFAS No. 71 requires a cost-based,  rate-regulated enterprise to
reflect the impact of  regulatory  decisions in its financial  statements.  APS'
existing  regulatory orders and the current regulatory  environment  support its
accounting  practices related to regulatory assets, which amounted to about $900
million at December  31,  1998.  Under the 1996  regulatory  agreement,  the ACC
accelerated the amortization of substantially  all of APS' regulatory  assets to
an eight-year period that will end June 30, 2004. If APS ceases to be cost-based
regulated,  it would no longer be able to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 71 to
part  or all of its  operations,  which  could  have a  material  impact  on our
financial  statements.  See  Note 1 for  additional  information  on  regulatory
accounting.

YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE

OVERVIEW

As the year 2000 approaches,  many companies face problems because many computer
systems and equipment will not properly  recognize calendar dates beginning with
the year 2000. We are  addressing  the Year 2000 issue as described  below.  APS
initiated a comprehensive  company-wide  Year 2000 program during 1997 to review
and  resolve  all Year 2000  issues in mission  critical  systems  (systems  and
equipment  that are key to business  function,  health,  and safety) in a timely
manner to ensure the  reliability  of electric  service to our  customers.  This
included a company-wide awareness program of the Year 2000 issue.

The following chart shows Year 2000 readiness of our mission critical systems as
of January 31, 1999:

                            Inventory       Assessment     Remediation & Testing
                            ---------       ----------     ---------------------
APS                           100%             100%               70%(1)
Pinnacle West and
  other subsidiaries
  (excluding APS)             100%             100%               80%(2)

(1)  Estimated to be at 100% by June 30, 1999, except one Palo Verde unit as
     discussed below.
(2) Estimated to be at 100% by June 30, 1999.

DISCUSSION

APS has been actively  implementing  and replacing  systems and technology since
1995 for general business reasons  unrelated to the Year 2000, and these actions
have resulted in  substantially  all of its major  information  technology  (IT)
systems becoming Year 2000 ready. The major IT systems that were, and are being,
implemented and replaced include the following:

+    Work Management
+    Materials Management
+    Energy Management


+    Payroll
+    Financial
+    Human Resources
+    Trouble Call Management
+    Computer and Communications Network Upgrades
+    Geographic Information Management
+    Customer Information System and
+    Palo Verde Site Work Management.

We  and  our  subsidiaries  have  made,  and  will  continue  to  make,  certain
modifications  to computer  hardware  and  software  systems  and  applications,
including  IT and non-IT  systems,  in an effort to ensure  they are  capable of
handling  changing  business  needs,  including  dates  in  the  year  2000  and
thereafter.  In  addition,  other APS IT systems and non-IT  systems,  including
embedded  technology and real-time  process control systems,  are being analyzed
for potential modifications.

Pinnacle  West,  APS,  SunCor,  and El  Dorado  have  inventoried  and  assessed
essentially all mission critical IT and non-IT systems and equipment. APS is 70%
complete and Pinnacle West and its other  subsidiaries are 80% complete with the
remediation and testing of these systems. Remediation and testing is expected to
be completed by June 30, 1999 for all mission critical systems, except for those
items that can only be completed during maintenance outages at Palo Verde, which
will be completed  for the last unit,  which is  substantially  identical to the
other two units, during the last half of 1999. APS has an internal audit/quality
review team that is periodically reviewing the individual Year 2000 projects and
their Year 2000 readiness.

APS currently  estimates that it will spend approximately $5 million relating to
Year  2000  issues,  about $3  million  of which  has been  spent to date.  This
includes an estimated  allocation of payroll costs for APS employees  working on
Year 2000 issues, and costs for consultants,  hardware,  and software. We do not
separately  track other internal costs.  This does not include any  expenditures
incurred  since 1995 to implement and replace  systems for reasons  unrelated to
the Year 2000,  as discussed  above.  Our cost to address the Year 2000 issue is
charged to  operating  expenses as incurred and has not had, and is not expected
to have, a material  adverse effect on our financial  position,  cash flows,  or
results of operations.  We expect to fund this cost with available cash balances
and cash provided by operations.

Pinnacle West and its  subsidiaries  are  communicating  with their  significant
suppliers,  business partners, other utilities, and large customers to determine
the  extent to which  they may be  affected  by these  third  parties'  plans to
remediate  their own Year 2000 issues in a timely manner.  These  companies have
been interfacing with suppliers of systems,  services, and materials in order to
assess whether their  schedules for analysis and remediation of Year 2000 issues
are timely and to assess their ability to continue to supply  required  services
and materials.

APS is also working with the North American Electric  Reliability Council (NERC)
through the Western Systems  Coordinating  Council (WSCC) to develop operational
plans for stable grid operation that will be utilized by APS and other utilities
in the western United  States.  These plans are expected to be completed by June
30, 1999. However, APS cannot currently predict the effect on APS if the systems
of these other companies are not Year 2000 ready.

We  currently  expect  that our most  reasonably  likely  worst  case  Year 2000
scenario would be  intermittent  loss of power to APS  customers,  similar to an
outage during a severe weather disturbance. In this situation, APS would restore
power as soon as possible by, among other things,  re-routing power flows. We do
not currently  expect that this scenario would have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

We are working to develop our own contingency  plans to handle Year 2000 issues,
including the most reasonably likely worst case scenario discussed above, and we
expect these plans to be completed by June 30, 1999. As discussed above, APS has
also been working  with NERC and WSCC to develop  contingency  plans  related to
grid operation.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS

We describe two new  accounting  rules in Note 2. First,  the new rule on energy
trading and risk  management is effective in 1999. We do not expect it to have a
material  impact  on our  financial  results.  Secondly,  the  new  standard  on
derivatives is effective for us in 2000. We are


currently evaluating what impact it will have on our financial statements. Also,
see Note 13 for a description  of a proposed  standard on accounting for certain
liabilities related to closure or removal of long-lived assets.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Our  operations  include  managing  market risks  related to changes in interest
rates,  commodity  prices,  and investments held by the nuclear  decommissioning
trust fund.

INTEREST RATE AND EQUITY RISK

Our major financial  market risk exposure is changing  interest rates.  Changing
interest  rates will affect  interest  paid on variable  rate debt and  interest
earned  by the  nuclear  decommissioning  trust  fund.  Our  policy is to manage
interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt.
The nuclear  decommissioning fund also has risks associated with changing market
values of equity  investments.  Nuclear  decommissioning  costs are recovered in
rates.

The tables below present  contractual  balances of our long-term and  short-term
debt at the  expected  maturity  dates  as  well  as the  fair  value  of  those
instruments  on December 31, 1998 and December  31, 1997.  The weighted  average
interest rates for the various debt presented are actual as of December 31, 1998
and December 31, 1997.

EXPECTED MATURITY/ PRINCIPAL REPAYMENT - DECEMBER 31, 1998


COMMODITY PRICE RISK

APS  utilizes  a variety of  derivative  instruments  including  exchange-traded
futures,  options,  and swaps as part of its overall risk management  strategies
and for  trading  purposes.  In  order  to  reduce  the  risk of  adverse  price
fluctuations in the electricity and natural gas markets, APS enters into futures
and/or option  transactions to hedge certain natural gas held in storage as well
as certain  expected  purchases  and sales of natural gas and  electricity.  The
changes in market value of such contracts  have a high  correlation to the price
changes in the hedged  commodity.  Gains and losses related to derivatives  that
qualify as hedges of expected  transactions  are  recognized  in income when the
underlying  hedged physical  transaction  closes  (deferral  method).  Gains and
losses on derivatives utilized for trading are recognized in income on a current
basis (the mark to market method).

APS has prepared a  sensitivity  analysis to estimate its exposure to the market
risk of its derivative position for natural gas and electricity. With respect to
these derivatives, a potential adverse price movement of 10% in the market price
of natural gas and electricity  from the December 31, 1998 levels would decrease
the fair value of these  instruments by approximately $1 million.  This analysis
does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical  price movement
would  have  on  expected  physical  purchases  and  sales  of  natural  gas and
electricity.

APS is exposed to credit losses in the event of  non-performance  or non-payment
by  counterparties.  APS uses a credit management  process to assess and monitor
the financial viability of its counterparties.  APS does not expect counterparty
defaults to materially impact its financial condition, results of operations, or
net cash flows.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The above discussion contains forward-looking  statements that involve risks and
uncertainties.  Words such as "estimates,"  "expects,"  "anticipates,"  "plans,"
"believes,"   "projects,"  and  similar  expressions  identify   forward-looking
statements.  These risks and uncertainties  include, but are not limited to, the
ongoing  restructuring of the electric  industry;  the outcome of the regulatory
proceedings  relating to the restructuring;  regulatory,  tax, and environmental
legislation;  the ability of APS to successfully compete outside its traditional
regulated  markets;  regional economic  conditions,  which could affect customer
growth;  the cost of debt  and  equity  capital;  weather  variations  affecting
customer usage;  technological  developments in the electric industry; Year 2000
issues; and the strength of the real estate market.

These factors and the other matters  discussed above may cause future results to
differ  materially  from  historical  results,  or from  results or  outcomes we
currently expect or seek.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT AND INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

The  primary  responsibility  for  the  integrity  of  the  Company's  financial
information rests with management, which has prepared the accompanying financial
statements and related information.  Such information was prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles  appropriate in the circumstances,
and based on  management's  best estimates and judgments.  Materiality was given
due consideration.  These financial  statements have been audited by independent
auditors and their report is included.

Management  maintains and relies upon systems of internal accounting controls. A
limiting factor in all systems of internal  accounting  control is that the cost
of the system should not exceed the benefits to be derived.  Management believes
that the Company's  system provides the  appropriate  balance between such costs
and benefits.

Periodically  the  internal  accounting  control  system is reviewed by both the
Company's internal auditors and its independent auditors to test for compliance.
Reports  issued by the internal  auditors are released to  management,  and such
reports or summaries thereof are transmitted to the Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors and the independent auditors on a timely basis.

The Audit Committee,  composed solely of outside  directors,  meets periodically
with the internal  auditors and independent  auditors (as well as management) to
review the work of each.  The internal  auditors and  independent  auditors have
free access to the Audit Committee,  without management  present, to discuss the
results of their audit work.

Management believes that the Company's systems,  policies and procedures provide
reasonable  assurance that  operations are conducted in conformity  with the law
and with management's commitment to a high standard of business conduct.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Pinnacle West
Capital  Corporation  and its  subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997 and
the related consolidated  statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows
for each of the  three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  1998.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.  We  conducted  our audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
auditing  standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material respects,  the financial position of Pinnacle West Capital  Corporation
and its  subsidiaries  at  December  31,  1998 and 1997 and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The consolidated  financial statements include the accounts of Pinnacle West and
our subsidiaries: APS, SunCor, and El Dorado.

APS, our major subsidiary and Arizona's largest electric  utility,  with 799,000
customers,  provides  wholesale or retail  electric  service to the entire state
with the exception of Tucson and about one-half of the Phoenix area. SunCor is a
developer of  residential,  commercial,  and industrial  projects on some 12,400
acres in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. El Dorado is a venture capital firm with
a diversified portfolio.

ACCOUNTING RECORDS

Our  accounting  records are maintained in accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting  principles  (GAAP).  The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in
accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates by management. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

REGULATORY ACCOUNTING

APS is regulated  by the Arizona  Corporation  Commission  (ACC) and the Federal
Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC).  The accompanying  financial  statements
reflect the ratemaking policies of these commissions. APS prepares its financial
statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." SFAS No. 71
requires  a  cost-based,  rate-regulated  enterprise  to  reflect  the impact of
regulatory decisions in its financial  statements.  APS' major regulatory assets
are deferred income taxes (see Note 4) and rate  synchronization  cost deferrals
(see "Rate  Synchronization Cost Deferrals" in this Note). These items, combined
with miscellaneous regulatory assets and liabilities,  amounted to approximately
$900 million at December 31, 1998 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 1997. Most of
these items are included in "Deferred  Debits" on the Balance Sheets.  Under the
1996 regulatory  agreement (see Note 3), the ACC accelerated the amortization of
substantially  all of APS' regulatory  assets to an eight-year  period that will
end June 30, 2004. APS records the accelerated  portion of the regulatory  asset
amortization, approximately $120 million pretax in 1998 and 1997 and $60 million
pretax in 1996, in depreciation  and  amortization  expense on the Statements of
Income.

During 1997, the Emerging  Issues Task Force (EITF) of the Financial  Accounting
Standards  Board (FASB) issued EITF 97-4. EITF 97-4 requires that SFAS No. 71 be
discontinued no later than when  legislation is passed or a rate order is issued
that  contains  sufficient  detail to determine its effect on the portion of the
business  being  deregulated,  which could result in writedowns or write-offs of
physical  and/or  regulatory  assets.  Additionally,  the EITF  determined  that
regulatory  assets should not be written off if they are to be recovered  from a
portion of the entity which continues to apply SFAS No. 71.

Although  rules have been  proposed  for  transitioning  generation  services to
competition,  there are many unresolved  issues. APS continues to apply SFAS No.
71 to its  generation  operations.  If rate recovery of regulatory  assets is no
longer probable,  whether due to competition or regulatory  action, APS would be
required  to write  off the  remaining  balance  as an  extraordinary  charge to
expense.

UTILITY PLANT AND DEPRECIATION

Utility  plant is the  term  APS uses to  describe  the  business  property  and
equipment  that  supports  electric  service.  APS reports  utility plant at its
original cost, which includes:

+    material and labor
+    contractor costs
+    construction overhead costs (where applicable) and
+    capitalized interest or an allowance for funds used during construction.


APS charges retired utility plant, plus removal costs less salvage realized,  to
accumulated  depreciation.  See Note 13 for information on a proposed accounting
standard that impacts accounting for removal costs.

APS records  depreciation on utility property on a straight-line  basis. For the
years 1996 through 1998 the rates, as prescribed by our regulators,  ranged from
a low of 1.51% to a high of 20%. The  weighted-average  rate for 1998 was 3.32%.
APS  depreciates  non-utility  property and equipment over the estimated  useful
lives of the related assets, ranging from 3 to 50 years.

CAPITALIZED INTEREST

In 1997,  APS began  capitalizing  interest  in  accordance  with  SFAS No.  34,
"Capitalization of Interest Cost."  Capitalized  interest represents the cost of
debt funds used to finance  construction  of utility plant.  Plant  construction
costs, including capitalized interest, are recovered in authorized rates through
depreciation  when  completed  projects  are placed into  commercial  operation.
Capitalized interest does not represent current cash earnings.  The rate used to
calculate capitalized interest for 1998 was 6.88% and for 1997 was 7.25%.

Prior to 1997,  APS  accrued an  allowance  for funds used  during  construction
(AFUDC).  AFUDC  represented  the cost of debt and equity  funds used to finance
construction  of utility plant.  AFUDC did not represent  current cash earnings.
AFUDC has been calculated using a composite rate of 7.75% for 1996.

REVENUES

APS records  electric  operating  revenues on the accrual basis,  which includes
estimated  amounts  for  service  rendered  but  unbilled  at the  end  of  each
accounting period.

RATE SYNCHRONIZATION COST DEFERRALS

As authorized by the ACC,  operating costs  (excluding fuel) and financing costs
of Palo Verde Units 2 and 3 were deferred from the  commercial  operation  dates
(September 1986 for Unit 2 and January 1988 for Unit 3) until the date the units
were  included in a rate order (April 1988 for Unit 2 and December 1991 for Unit
3). Beginning July 1, 1996, the deferrals are being amortized over an eight-year
period in accordance with the 1996  regulatory  agreement (see Note 3). Prior to
July 1, 1996,  the  deferrals  were  amortized  over  thirty-five  year periods.
Amortization  of the  deferrals  is included in  depreciation  and  amortization
expense on the Statements of Income.

NUCLEAR FUEL

APS charges nuclear fuel to fuel expense by using the unit-of-production method.
The unit-of-production  method is an amortization method that is based on actual
physical  usage.  APS  divides the cost of the fuel by the  estimated  number of
thermal  units that APS expects to produce with that fuel.  APS then  multiplies
that rate by the number of thermal  units that it  produces  within the  current
period. This provides APS with current period nuclear fuel expense.

APS also  charges  nuclear  fuel  expense  for the  permanent  disposal of spent
nuclear fuel. The United States  Department of Energy (DOE) is  responsible  for
the permanent  disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and it charges APS $0.001 per kWh
of nuclear  generation.  See Note 12 for  information  about spent  nuclear fuel
disposal. In addition, Note 13 has information on nuclear decommissioning costs.

INCOME TAXES

We file our federal  income tax return on a  consolidated  basis and we file our
state income tax returns on a consolidated  or unitary basis. In accordance with
our  intercompany  tax sharing  agreement,  federal and state  income  taxes are
allocated to each subsidiary as though each  subsidiary  filed a separate income
tax return.  Any  difference  between  the  aforementioned  allocations  and the
consolidated  (and  unitary)  income tax  liability is  attributed to the parent
company.

REACQUIRED DEBT COSTS

When APS incurs gains or losses on debt that it retires  prior to maturity,  APS
amortizes those gains or losses over the remaining original life of the debt. In
accordance with the 1996 regulatory  agreement (see Note 3), the ACC accelerated
APS'  amortization  of the  regulatory  asset for  reacquired  debt  costs to an
eight-year  period that will end June 30, 2004. The  accelerated  portion of the
regulatory  asset  amortization  is included in  depreciation  and  amortization
expense in the Statements of Income.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

We consider  temporary cash  investments  and  marketable  securities to be cash
equivalents for purposes of reporting cash flows. During 1998, 1997, and 1996 we
paid  interest,  net of amounts  capitalized,  income  taxes,  and  dividends on
preferred stock of APS.

Interest paid, net of amounts capitalized, was:

+    $143.9 million in 1998
+    $163.0 million in 1997 and
+    $185.9 million in 1996.


Income taxes paid were:

+    $164.9 million in 1998
+    $146.2 million in 1997 and
+    $121.0 million in 1996.

Dividends paid on preferred stock of APS were:

+    $10.3 million in 1998
+    $13.3 million in 1997 and
+    $17.4 million in 1996.

SEGMENTS

APS is Pinnacle West's only reportable segment. Unless otherwise identified, APS
represents substantially all of the consolidated information being reported.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

We have  reclassified  certain prior year amounts for  comparison  purposes with
1998.

2. ACCOUNTING MATTERS

In 1998 we adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income." This standard
changes the reporting of certain items  previously  reported in the common stock
equity section of the balance  sheet.  The effects of adopting SFAS No. 130 were
not material to our financial statements.

In November 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board's  Emerging Issues
Task Force  issued  EITF 98-10,  "Accounting  for  Contracts  Involved in Energy
Trading and Risk Management Activities," which is effective for us in 1999. EITF
98-10 requires  energy trading  contracts to be measured at fair value as of the
balance sheet date with the gains and losses included in earnings and separately
disclosed in the financial statements or footnotes. We have evaluated the impact
of this  rule  and  believe  the  effects  are  not  material  to our  financial
statements.

In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities,"  which  is
effective  for us in 2000.  SFAS No. 133 requires  that  entities  recognize all
derivatives  as either  assets or  liabilities  on the balance sheet and measure
those  instruments at fair value. The standard also provides  specific  guidance
for  accounting  for  derivatives  designated  as  hedging  instruments.  We are
currently  evaluating  what  impact  this  standard  will have on our  financial
statements.

3. REGULATORY MATTERS

ELECTRIC INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING

STATE

In  December  1996,  the ACC  adopted  rules that  provide a  framework  for the
introduction of retail electric  competition in Arizona.  The rules, as amended,
became  effective on August 10, 1998,  and on December 10, 1998, the ACC adopted
the amended rules without any modifications that would have a significant impact
on us. We believe that certain  provisions of the 1996 ACC rules and the amended
rules are  deficient  and APS has filed  lawsuits  to protect  its legal  rights
regarding the 1996 rules and the amended  rules.  These lawsuits are pending but
two related  cases filed by other  utilities  have been  partially  decided in a
manner adverse to those utilities' positions.

On January 11,  1999,  the ACC issued an order which  stayed the amended  rules,
granted  reconsideration  of the  decision  to make  the  rules  permanent,  and
directed the hearing  division of the ACC to  establish a  procedural  order for
further action on these rules.  The order also granted  waivers from  compliance
with the rules for APS, and all affected utilities.

On February 5, 1999, the ACC Hearing Division issued recommendations for changes
to the amended rules. The recommended  changes to the amended rules were further
modified by a Procedural Order of the ACC Hearing Division dated March 12, 1999.
The recommended rules include the following major provisions:

+    They would apply to virtually all Arizona electric  utilities  regulated by
     the ACC, including APS.
+    Each  utility  must  make at  least  20% of its  1995  retail  peak  demand
     available for competitive generation supply.
+    The rules  become  effective  when the ACC makes a final  decision  on each
     utility's  stranded  costs and  unbundled  rates (Final  Decision  Date) or
     January 1, 2001, whichever comes first.
+    Subject to the 20% requirement,  all utility  customers with single premise
     loads of one megawatt or greater will be eligible for competitive  electric
     services on the Final Decision Date. Customers with single premise loads of
     40  kilowatts  or greater  may  aggregate  loads to meet this one  megawatt
     requirement.
+    When  effective,  residential  customers  will be phased  in at 1-1/4%  per
     quarter  calculated  beginning  on  January  1,  1999,  subject  to the 20%
     requirement above.
+    Electric  service  providers  that  get  Certificates  of  Convenience  and
     Necessity  (CC&Ns)  from  the ACC can  supply  only  competitive  services,
     including   electric   generation,   but  not  electric   transmission  and
     distribution.
+    Affected utilities must file ACC tariffs with separate pricing for electric
     services provided for noncompetitive services.


+    ACC shall  allow a  reasonable  opportunity  for  recovery  of  unmitigated
     stranded costs (see "Stranded Costs" below).
+    Absent an ACC waiver,  prior to January 1, 2001, each affected utility must
     transfer  all  competitive  generation  assets  and  services  either to an
     unaffiliated party or to a separate corporate affiliate.
+    Affiliate transaction rules prohibit a utility and its competitive electric
     affiliates from sharing certain assets, employees, and information.

If  approved  by the ACC,  the rules  would be subject to the formal  rulemaking
process  under  Arizona  statute.   In  compliance  with  statutory   procedural
requirements,  ACC oral  proceedings  on the matter would be scheduled no sooner
than 30 days after the proposed rules are published by the Secretary of State.

We  cannot  currently  predict  when or if the  amended  rules  will be  further
modified,  when the stay of the  amended  rules will be lifted,  or when  retail
electric competition will be introduced in Arizona.

STRANDED COSTS

On June 22, 1998,  the ACC issued an order on stranded  cost  determination  and
recovery.  APS believes  that certain  provisions of the stranded cost order are
deficient and in August 1998, APS filed two lawsuits to protect its legal rights
relating to the order.

On February 5, 1999, the ACC Hearing Division issued recommended  changes to the
June 1998 stranded cost order. These recommended changes were further amended by
an ACC  Procedural  Order dated March 12, 1999. The  recommended  changes to the
stranded cost order would be effective upon approval of the ACC. The recommended
order, as amended on March 12, 1999, allows each affected utility to choose from
five options for the recovery of stranded costs:

+    Net Revenues Lost Methodology is the difference between generation revenues
     under traditional regulation and generation revenues under competition.
     This option provides for declining recovery percentages for stranded costs
     over a five-year recovery period. Regulatory assets are to be fully
     recovered under their presently authorized amortization schedule. In
     accordance with a 1996 regulatory agreement, the ACC accelerated the
     amortization of substantially all of APS' regulatory assets to an
     eight-year period that ends June 30, 2004.
+    Divestiture/Auction   Methodology   allows  a  utility  to  divest  all  or
     substantially  all of its generating  assets,  including  regulatory assets
     associated  with  generation,  in  order  to  collect  100  percent  of the
     difference  between  net sales  price and book value of  generating  assets
     divested over a ten-year period, with no return on the unamortized balance.
+    Financial Integrity  Methodology allows a utility  "sufficient  revenues to
     meet minimum financial ratios" for a period of ten years.
+    Settlement Methodology allows a settlement to be agreed upon by the ACC and
     a utility.
+    Any combination of the above is shown to be in the best interest of all
     affected parties.

LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES

An  Arizona  joint  legislative  committee  studied  electric  utility  industry
restructuring  issues in 1996 and 1997.  In  conjunction  with that  study,  the
Arizona legislative counsel prepared memoranda in late 1997 related to the legal
authority of the ACC to deregulate the Arizona  electric utility  industry.  The
memoranda  raise a  question  as to the  degree to which the ACC may,  under the
Arizona  Constitution,  deregulate any portion of the electric  utility industry
and allow rates to be  determined by market  forces.  This latter issue has been
subsequently  decided  by lower  courts  in  favor  of the ACC in four  separate
lawsuits, two of which are unrelated.

In May 1998, a law was enacted to facilitate  implementation  of retail electric
competition in Arizona. The law includes the following major provisions:

+    Arizona's largest government-operated electric utility (Salt River Project)
     and, at their option, smaller municipal electric systems must (i) make at
     least 20% of their 1995 retail peak demand available to electric service
     providers by December 31, 1998 and for all retail customers by December 31,
     2000; (ii) decrease rates by at least 10% over a ten-year period beginning
     as early as January 1, 1991; (iii) implement procedures and public
     processes comparable to those already applicable to public service
     corporations, for establishing the terms, conditions, and pricing of
     electric services as well as certain other decisions affecting retail
     electric competition;
+    describes the factors which form the basis of consideration by Salt River
     Project in determining stranded costs; and
+    metering and meter reading services must be provided on a competitive basis
     during the first two years of competition only for customers having demands
     in excess of one megawatt (and that are eligible for competitive generation
     services),  and thereafter for all customers receiving competitive electric
     generation.


In addition,  the Arizona  legislature will review and make  recommendations for
the 1999 legislature on certain competitive issues.

AGREEMENT WITH SALT RIVER PROJECT

On April 25, 1998,  APS entered into a Memorandum  of Agreement  with Salt River
Project  in  anticipation  of, and to  facilitate,  the  opening of the  Arizona
electric industry. The Agreement contains the following major components:

+    Both parties would amend the  Territorial  Agreement to remove any barriers
     to the provision of  competitive  electricity  supply and  non-distribution
     services.
+    Both  parties  would amend the Power  Coordination  Agreement  to lower the
     price  that  APS  will  pay  Salt  River  Project  for  purchased  power by
     approximately  $17  million  (pretax)  during  the first full year that the
     Agreement is effective and by lesser annual  amounts  during the next seven
     years.
+    Both parties agreed on certain  legislative  positions  regarding  electric
     utility restructuring at the state and federal level.

Certain provisions of the Agreement (including those relating to the amendments
of the Territorial Agreement and the Power Coordination Agreement) are affected
by the timing of the introduction of competition. See "ACC Rules" above. On
February 18, 1999, the ACC approved the Agreement.

GENERAL

We believe that further ACC  decisions,  legislation  at the Arizona and federal
levels, and perhaps amendments to the Arizona  Constitution (which would require
a  vote  of  the  people)  will  ultimately  be  required   before   significant
implementation  of retail  electric  competition  can lawfully occur in Arizona.
Until the manner of implementation of competition, including addressing stranded
costs,  is determined,  we cannot  accurately  predict the impact of full retail
competition on our financial position,  cash flows, or results of operation.  As
competition in the electric  industry  continues to evolve,  we will continue to
evaluate strategies and alternatives that will position us to compete in the new
regulatory environment.

FEDERAL

The  Energy  Policy  Act of 1992 and recent  rulemakings  by FERC have  promoted
increased  competition in the wholesale  electric  power  markets.  APS does not
expect these rules to have a material impact on its financial statements.

Several  electric  utility  reform  bills  have been  introduced  during  recent
congressional  sessions,  which as currently  written  would allow  consumers to
choose their  electricity  suppliers by 2000 or 2003.  These bills,  other bills
that are expected to be introduced, and ongoing discussions at the federal level
suggest  a wide  range of  opinion  that  will need to be  narrowed  before  any
substantial restructuring of the electric utility industry can occur.

1996 REGULATORY AGREEMENT

In April 1996, the ACC approved a regulatory agreement between the ACC Staff and
APS. The major provisions of this agreement are:

+    An annual rate reduction of approximately  $48.5 million ($29 million after
     income taxes), or 3.4% on average for all customers except certain contract
     customers, effective July 1, 1996.
+    Recovery of  substantially  all of APS' present  regulatory  assets through
     accelerated  amortization  over an eight-year period that will end June 30,
     2004,  increasing  annual  amortization by approximately  $120 million ($72
     million after income taxes). See Note 1.
+    A  formula  for  sharing   future  cost  savings   between   customers  and
     shareholders  (price reduction formula)  referencing a return on equity (as
     defined) of 11.25%.
+    A moratorium  on filing for  permanent  rate changes prior to July 2, 1999,
     except under the price  reduction  formula and under  certain other limited
     circumstances.
+    Infusion of $200 million of common  equity into APS by the parent  company,
     in annual payments of $50 million starting in 1996.

Based on the price reduction formula, the ACC approved retail price decreases of
approximately  $17.6  million  ($10.5  million  after  income  taxes),  or 1.2%,
effective July 1, 1997, and  approximately $17 million ($10 million after income
taxes),  or 1.1%,  effective  July 1, 1998. APS expects to file with the ACC for
another retail price  decrease of  approximately  $10. 8 million  annually ($6.5
million after income  taxes) to become  effective  July 1, 1999.  The amount and
timing of the price decrease are subject to ACC approval.  This will be the last
price decrease under the 1996 regulatory agreement.


4. INCOME TAXES

INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT

Because of a 1994 rate settlement agreement, we are amortizing almost all of our
investment tax credits (ITCs) over 5 years (1995-1999).

INCOME TAXES

Certain assets and liabilities are reported  differently for income tax purposes
than they are for financial  statements.  The tax effect of these differences is
recorded as deferred taxes. We calculate deferred taxes using the current income
tax rates.

APS has recorded a regulatory asset on its Balance Sheet in accordance with SFAS
No. 71. This regulatory asset is for certain  temporary  differences,  primarily
AFUDC equity. APS amortizes this amount as the differences reverse. APS has been
able to accelerate its  amortization of the regulatory asset for income taxes to
an  eight-year  period that will end June 30,  2004.  This is a result of a 1996
regulatory   agreement  with  the  ACC.  We  are  including   this   accelerated
amortization  in  depreciation  and  amortization  expense on the  Statements of
Income. The components of income tax expense are:

(a)  This  schedule  does not reflect the timing of  redemptions  that may occur
     prior to maturity.
(b)  The  weighted-average  rate for the year ended  December 31, 1998 was 3.39%
     and for December 31, 1997 was 3.62%.  Changes in short-term  interest rates
     would affect the costs associated with this debt.
(c)  APS has issued $150 million of first  mortgage bonds ("senior note mortgage
     bonds") to the senior note trustee as collateral for the senior notes.  The
     senior note mortgage  bonds have the same interest rate,  interest  payment
     dates,  maturity,  and  redemption  provisions  as the senior  notes.  APS'
     payments of principal, premium, and/or interest on the senior notes satisfy
     its corresponding payment obligations on the senior note mortgage bonds. As
     long as the senior note mortgage bonds secure the senior notes,  the senior
     notes will  effectively  rank equally with the first mortgage bonds. On the
     date that APS has repaid all of its first mortgage 


     bonds,  other than those that secure senior notes, the senior note mortgage
     bonds  will no  longer  secure  the  senior  notes  and  will  cease  to be
     outstanding.
(d)  The  weighted-average  rate at December  31, 1998 was 5.69% and at December
     31, 1997 was 6.25%.  Changes in short-term  interest rates would affect the
     costs associated with this debt.
(e)  Represents  the present value of future lease  payments  (discounted  at an

(f)  The  weighted-average  rate at December  31, 1998 was 8.21% and at December
     31, 1997 was 8.60%.  Interest  for 1998 and 1997 was based on LIBOR plus 2%
     or prime plus 0.5%.

     31, 1997 was 8.44%.  Interest  for 1998 and 1997 was based on LIBOR plus 2%

     1997 was LIBOR plus 0.33%-0.4%.
(j)  Includes two series of notes: $25 million at 6.62% due 2001, and $25
     million at 6.87% due 2003.

The following is a list of principal  payments due on total  long-term  debt and
sinking fund requirements through 2003:

+    $168.0 million in 1999
+    $140.4 million in 2000
+    $121.0 million in 2001
+    $125.1 million in 2002 and
+    $150.1 million in 2003.

First  mortgage  bondholders  share a lien on  substantially  all utility  plant
assets  (other than nuclear  fuel,  transportation  equipment,  and the combined
cycle  plant).  The  mortgage  bond  indenture  includes  provisions  that would
restrict the payment of common stock dividends under certain  conditions.  These
conditions did not exist at December 31, 1998.

9. RETIREMENT PLANS AND OTHER BENEFITS

VOLUNTARY SEVERANCE PLAN

APS sponsored a voluntary  severance plan in 1996.  There was a pretax charge of
$31.7 million in 1996 recorded  mostly as operations  and  maintenance  expense.
This  pretax  charge  included  additional  pension and  postretirement  benefit
expense. Employees who participated in the plan were credited with an additional
year of age and service  when their  pension and  postretirement  benefits  were
calculated.  The  additional  expenses  recorded in 1996 for this plan were $2.3
million for pension and $5.4 million for postretirement benefits.

PENSION PLANS

Pinnacle West and its  subsidiaries  sponsor  defined  benefit pension plans for
their employees.  A defined benefit plan specifies the amount of benefits a plan
participant  is to receive using  information  about the  participant.  The plan
covers  nearly all of our  employees.  Our  employees do not  contribute to this
plan. Generally, we calculate the benefits under these plans based on age, years
of  service,  and pay.  We fund the plan by  contributing  at least the  minimum
amount required under Internal Revenue Service  regulations but no more than the
maximum  tax-deductible amount. The assets in the plan at December 31, 1998 were
mostly  domestic  and  international  common  stocks and bonds and real  estate.
Pension expense, including administrative and severance costs, was:

+    $10.5 million in 1998
+    $9.3 million in 1997 and
+    $15.5 million in 1996.

We made the assumptions below to calculate the pension liability:

Expected long- term rate of return on assets            10.00%           9.00%

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN BENEFITS

We also  sponsor a defined  contribution  savings plan that is offered to nearly
all employees.  In a defined contribution plan, the benefits a participant is to
receive result from regular  contributions to a participant account.  Under this
plan,  we make  matching  contributions  to  participant  accounts.  We recorded
expenses for this plan of:

+    $4.1 million in 1998
+    $3.9 million in 1997 and
+    $3.6 million in 1996.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

We provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired  employees.  Employees
must retire to become eligible for these retirement benefits, which are based on
years of  service  and age.  For the  medical  insurance  plans,  retirees  make
contributions to cover a portion of the plan costs. For the life insurance plan,
retirees  do not make  contributions  to cover a portion of the plan  costs.  We
retain the right to change or eliminate these benefits.

Funding  is  based  upon  actuarially  determined  contributions  that  take tax
consequences into account.  Plan assets consist primarily of domestic stocks and
bonds. The postretirement benefit expense was:

+    $9.1 million for 1998
+    $9.8 million for 1997 and
+    $16.2 million for 1996.

The following table shows the components of net periodic  postretirement benefit
costs  before  consideration  of  amounts  capitalized  or billed to others  and

We made the assumptions below to calculate the postretirement liability:

Expected long- term rate of return

  (reached in the year 2002)                             5.00%           5.00%

Assuming a 1%  increase  in the health  care cost trend  rate,  the 1998 cost of
postretirement benefits other than pensions would increase by approximately $4.6
million and the  accumulated  benefit  obligation  as of December 31, 1998 would
increase by approximately $37.8 million.

Assuming a 1%  decrease  in the health  care cost trend  rate,  the 1998 cost of
postretirement benefits other than pensions would decrease by approximately $3.8
million and the  accumulated  benefit  obligation  as of December 31, 1998 would
decrease by approximately $31.9 million.

10.  LEASES

In 1986, APS sold about 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain common
facilities in three separate sale leaseback transactions. APS accounts for these
leases  as  operating  leases.  The gain of  approximately  $140.2  million  was
deferred and is being  amortized  to  operations  expense  over 29.5 years,  the
original  term of the  leases.  There are  options  to renew the  leases for two
additional  years and to purchase  the property for fair market value at the end
of the lease terms. Consistent with the ratemaking treatment, an amount equal to
the annual lease  payments is included in rent  expense.  A regulatory  asset is
recognized for the difference between lease payments and rent expense calculated
on a straight-line basis.

The average amounts to be paid for the Palo Verde Unit 2 leases are as follows:

     Year     (In Millions)
     ----     -------------
     1999        $ 40. 1
     2000          46. 3
2001-2015          49. 0

In  accordance  with  the  1996  regulatory  agreement  (see  Note  3),  the ACC
accelerated  APS'  amortization  of  the  regulatory  asset  for  leases  to  an
eight-year  period that will end June 30, 2004. The accelerated  amortization is
included in depreciation and  amortization  expense on the Statements of Income.
The balance of this  regulatory  asset at December  31, 1998 was $48.5  million.
Lease  expense was  approximately  $42 million in each of the years 1996 through
1998.

APS has a capital  lease on a  combined  cycle  plant,  which it sold and leased
back. The lease requires  semiannual payments of $2.6 million through June 2001,
and includes  renewal and purchase options based on fair market value. The plant
is  included  in  plant  in  service  at its  original  cost of  $54.4  million;
accumulated amortization at December 31, 1998 was $48.6 million.

In addition,  we lease certain land,  buildings,  equipment,  and  miscellaneous
other items through operating rental agreements with varying terms,  provisions,
and expiration dates. Approximate miscellaneous lease expense was:

+    $13.1 million in 1998
+    $11.2 million in 1997 and
+    $12.8 million in 1996.

Estimated  future  minimum  lease  commitments,  excluding  the Palo  Verde  and
combined cycle leases, are as follows:

Year                       (In Millions)
- ----                       -------------

2003                            18.2

11.  JOINTLY-OWNED FACILITIES

APS shares ownership of some of its generation and transmission  facilities with
other companies.  The following table shows APS' interest in those jointly-owned
facilities  at December 31, 1998.  APS' share of operating and  maintaining  the
facilities  is  included  in the  Income  Statement  in utility  operations  and
maintenance expense.


(a)  The construction  costs at Navajo are primarily related to the installation
     of scrubbers required by environmental legislation.
(b)  PacifiCorp  owns  Cholla  Unit 4 and APS  operates  the unit for them.  The
     common facilities at the Cholla Plant are jointly-owned.

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

LITIGATION

We are party to various  claims,  legal actions,  and complaints  arising in the
ordinary course of business.  In our opinion,  the ultimate  resolution of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.

PALO VERDE NUCLEAR GENERATING STATION

Under the  Nuclear  Waste  Policy Act,  the  Department  of Energy  (DOE) was to
develop the facilities  necessary for the storage and disposal of spent fuel and
to have the first such facility in operation by 1998.  That facility was to be a
permanent repository, but DOE has announced that such a repository now cannot be
completed  before 2010. In response to lawsuits  filed over DOE's  obligation to
accept  used  nuclear  fuel,  the United  States  Court of Appeals  for the D.C.
Circuit has ruled that DOE had an  obligation  to begin  accepting  used nuclear
fuel in 1998.  However,  the Court refused to issue an order  compelling  DOE to
begin moving used fuel.  Instead,  the Court ruled that any damages to utilities
should be sought under the standard  contract  signed between DOE and utilities,
including  APS. The United  States  Supreme Court has refused to grant review of
the D. C.  Circuit's  decision.  In July 1998,  APS filed a Petition  for Review
regarding DOE's obligation to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel.

APS has  capacity in  existing  fuel  storage  pools at Palo Verde  which,  with
certain modifications, could accommodate all fuel expected to be discharged from
normal  operation of Palo Verde through 2002, and believes it could augment that
wet  storage  with new  facilities  for on-site dry storage of spent fuel for an
indeterminate period of operation beyond 2002, subject to obtaining any required
governmental approvals.  APS currently estimates that it will incur $113 million
(in 1998 dollars) over the life of Palo Verde for its share of the costs related
to the on-site  interim  storage of spent nuclear fuel.  Beginning in 1999,  APS
will accrue these costs as a component of fuel expense, meaning the charges will
be accrued as the fuel is burned.  During 1998,  APS recorded a liability  and a
regulatory  asset of $35 million for on-site  interim nuclear fuel storage costs
related to nuclear fuel burned prior to 1999. APS currently  believes that spent
fuel  storage or disposal  methods  will be  available  for use by Palo Verde to
allow its continued operation beyond 2002.

The Palo Verde  participants have insurance for public liability  resulting from
nuclear  energy  hazards to the full limit of liability  under federal law. This
potential liability is covered by primary


liability  insurance provided by commercial  insurance carriers in the amount of
$200  million  and the  balance  by an  industry-wide  retrospective  assessment
program. If losses at any nuclear power plant covered by the programs exceed the
accumulated funds, APS could be assessed retrospective premium adjustments.  The
maximum  assessment  per reactor under the program for each nuclear  incident is
approximately  $88  million,  subject  to an  annual  limit of $10  million  per
incident.  Based upon APS' 29.1%  interest in the three Palo Verde  units,  APS'
maximum  potential  assessment per incident for all three units is approximately
$77 million, with an annual payment limitation of approximately $9 million.

The Palo Verde  participants  maintain  "all  risk"(including  nuclear  hazards)
insurance for property damage to, and decontamination of, property at Palo Verde
in the aggregate  amount of $2.75 billion,  a substantial  portion of which must
first be applied to  stabilization  and  decontamination.  APS has also  secured
insurance  against  portions of any  increased  cost of  generation or purchased
power and business interruption resulting from a sudden and unforeseen outage of
any of the  three  units.  The  insurance  coverage  discussed  in this  and the
previous paragraph is subject to certain policy conditions and exclusions.

FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER COMMITMENTS

APS is a party to various fuel and purchased power contracts with terms expiring
from 1999 through 2020 that include required purchase provisions.  APS estimates
its 1999 contract  requirements to be about $132 million.  However,  this amount
may vary  significantly  pursuant to certain  provisions in such  contracts that
permit APS to decrease its required purchases under certain circumstances.

APS must  reimburse  certain coal  providers for amounts  incurred for coal mine
reclamation.  APS estimates  its share of the total  obligation to be about $103
million.  The portion of the coal mine  reclamation  obligation  related to coal
already  burned is about $62  million at  December  31,  1998 and is included in
"Deferred  Credits-Other"  in the Balance  Sheet.  A  regulatory  asset has been
established  for amounts not yet recovered from  ratepayers.  In accordance with
the  1996  regulatory   agreement  (see  Note  3),  the  ACC  began  accelerated
amortization of APS' regulatory  asset for coal mine  reclamation  costs over an
eight-  year  period that will end June 30,  2004.  Amortization  is included in
depreciation and amortization  expense on the Statements of Income.  The balance
of the regulatory asset at December 31, 1998 was about $51 million.

CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM

Consolidated capital expenditures in 1999 are estimated at $386 million.

13. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING COSTS

APS  recorded  $11.4  million for  decommissioning  expense in each of the years
1998,  1997,  and 1996.  APS  estimates  it will cost about $1.8  billion  ($452
million in 1998 dollars) to decommission its 29.1% share of the three Palo Verde
units.  The  decommissioning  costs are  expected to be incurred  over a 14-year
period beginning in 2024. APS charges  decomissioning costs to expense over each
unit's operating license term and includes them in the accumulated  depreciation
balance until each unit is retired.  Nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered
in rates.

APS' current  estimates are based on a 1998  site-specific  study for Palo Verde
that  assumes the prompt  removal/dismantlement  method of  decommissioning.  An
independent  consultant prepared this study. APS is required to update the study
every three years.

To fund  the  costs  APS  expects  to  incur  to  decommission  the  plant,  APS
established   external   decommissioning   trusts  in  accordance  with  Nuclear
Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  regulations.  The trust  accounts are reported in
"Investments  and Other  Assets"  on the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets at their
market  value of $145.6  million at  December  31,  1998 and  $124.6  million at
December  31,  1997.  APS  invests  the trust funds  primarily  in fixed  income
securities  and  domestic  stock  and  classifies  them as  available  for sale.
Realized  and   unrealized   gains  and  losses  are  reflected  in  accumulated
depreciation.

In February 1996,  the FASB issued an exposure  draft,  "Accounting  for Certain
Liabilities  Related to Closure or Removal of Long-Lived Assets."  This proposed
standard   would   require  the   estimated   present   value  of  the  cost  of
decommissioning  and certain  other removal costs to be recorded as a liability,
along with an  offsetting  plant asset when a  decommissioning  or other removal
obligation is incurred.  The FASB has indicated  that a revised  exposure  draft
will be issued in 1999.

(b)  Dividends for the quarters ending September 30, 1998 and September 30, 1997
     were declared in June.

15. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We believe  that the carrying  amounts of our cash  equivalents  and  commercial
paper are  reasonable  estimates  of their fair values at December  31, 1998 and
1997 due to their short maturities.

We hold  investments  in debt and  equity  securities  for  purposes  other than
trading.  The December 31, 1998 and 1997 fair values of such investments,  which
we determine by using quoted market values or by discounting cash flows at rates
equal to our cost of capital, approximate their carrying amount.

The  carrying  value  of our  long-term  debt  (excluding  a  capitalized  lease
obligation) was $2.21 billion on December 31, 1998, with an estimated fair value
of $2.28 billion. On December 31, 1997, the carrying value of our long-term debt
(excluding a capitalized lease obligation) was $2.34 billion,  with an estimated
fair value of $2.38 billion. The fair value estimates are based on quoted market
prices of the same or similar issues.


16. EARNINGS PER SHARE

In 1997 we adopted SFAS No. 128,  "Earnings Per Share." This statement  requires
the  presentation of both basic and diluted  earnings per share on the financial
statements.  The  following  table  presents  earnings per average  common share
outstanding (EPS):

                                               1998         1997        1996
                                               ----         ----        ----
Basic EPS:
  Continuing operations                        $2.87        $2.76      $ 2.41

  Net income                                   $2.87        $2.76      $ 2.07
                                               =====        =====      ======

Diluted EPS:
  Continuing operations                        $2.85        $2.74      $ 2.40
  Discontinued operations                         --           --       (0.11)
  Extraordinary charge                            --           --       (0.23)
                                               -----        -----      ------
  Net income                                   $2.85        $2.74      $ 2.06
                                               =====        =====      ======

Dilutive stock options  increased  average common shares  outstanding by 571,728
shares  in 1998,  519,800  shares in 1997,  and  580,405  shares in 1996.  Total
average  common  shares  outstanding  for the  purposes of  calculating  diluted
earnings per share were 85,345,946  shares in 1998,  86,022,709  shares in 1997,
and 88,021,920 shares in 1996.

Options  to  purchase  244,200  shares of common  stock at $46.78 per share were
outstanding  during  the last  quarter  of 1998 but  were  not  included  in the
computation of diluted EPS because the options'  exercise price was greater than
the average market price of the common shares.

17. STOCK OPTIONS

We offer several stock incentive plans for our officers,  APS officers,  and key
employees.

The plans provide for the granting of new options or awards of up to 3.5 million
shares at a price per  option  not less than fair  market  value on the date the
option is granted. The plans also provide for the granting of any combination of
stock appreciation rights or dividend equivalents.  The awards outstanding under
the  various  incentive  plans  at  December  31,  1998  approximate   1,497,012
non-qualified  stock  options,   158,121  restricted  shares,  and  no  dividend
equivalent shares, incentive stock options, or stock appreciation rights.

The FASB issued SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation"  which
was effective for 1996. The statement  encourages,  but does not require, that a
company record compensation  expense based on the fair value method. We continue
to  recognize  expense  based on  Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees."  If we had  recorded  compensation
expense based on the fair value  method,  our net income would have been reduced
to the following pro forma amounts:

Except Per Share Amounts)              1998          1997          1996

  Pro forma (fair value method)      $   2.86      $   2.75      $   2.07


We did not consider  compensation costs for stock options granted before January
1, 1995. Therefore, future reported net income may not be representative of this
compensation  cost  calculation.  In order to present the pro forma  information
above,  we calculated the fair value of each fixed stock option in the incentive
plans  using  the  Black-Scholes   option-pricing  model.  The  fair  value  was
calculated   based  on  the  date  the  option  was   granted.   The   following
weighted-average assumptions were also used in order to calculate the fair value
of the stock options:

                                   1998           1997           1996

December 31, 1998,  1997,  and 1996 and changes during the years ending on those
dates:
