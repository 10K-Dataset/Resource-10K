                               ITEM 1. BUSINESS

THE COMPANY

    Pinnacle West Capital  Corporation  (the "Company") was incorporated in 1985
under the laws of the State of Arizona  and is engaged  in the  acquisition  and
holding of securities of  corporations  for investment  purposes.  The principal
executive  offices of the  Company  are  located  at 400 East Van Buren  Street,
Phoenix, Arizona 85004 (telephone 602-379-2500).

    The Company and its  subsidiaries  employ  approximately  7,440 persons.  Of
these employees,  approximately  6,535 are employees of the Company's  principal
subsidiary,  Arizona Public Service Company ("APS"),  and employees  assigned to
joint projects of APS where APS serves as a project manager,  and  approximately
905 are employees of the Company and its other subsidiaries.

    Other  subsidiaries  of the  Company,  in  addition to APS,  include  SunCor
Development  Company  ("SunCor") and El Dorado Investment Company ("El Dorado").
SunCor is engaged  primarily in the owning,  holding,  and  development  of real
property.  El Dorado is involved in the business of making equity investments in
other  companies.  See "Business of Non-Utility  Subsidiaries"  in this Item for
further information regarding SunCor and El Dorado.

    CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

    During the past three years,  the Company's  primary cash needs were for the
payment of interest and the optional and mandatory repayment of principal on its
long-term  debt.  Additional  cash  needs in 1993 and 1994 were  related  to the
resumption  and  subsequent  growth of common  stock  dividends.  The  Company's
ability to satisfy its debt service obligations is substantially  dependent upon
the receipt of common stock  dividends  from APS. See Note 5 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding
the Company's and APS' outstanding long-term debt.

    The terms and  provisions of certain of the Company's  financing  agreements
place severe  restrictions on the Company's ability to incur additional debt, to
make capital infusions into its subsidiaries  (excluding APS), to make other new
investments,  and to pay  cash  dividends  to its  shareholders  unless  certain
conditions  are met.  While the debt under these  financing  agreements  remains
outstanding, the Company has agreed not to incur new debt, except generally (and
with  certain  restrictions)  for  borrowings  to reduce,  refinance,  or prepay
existing  debt.  The  Company's  ability to pay cash  dividends or to make other
corporate  distributions is dependent upon the satisfaction of certain financial
covenants. As of December 31, 1994, the Company could have declared dividends of
approximately $259 million based on these covenants.

    In the event of a sale of all or  substantially  all of the assets or shares
of common stock of El Dorado or SunCor, the net cash proceeds must be applied by
the Company to reduce its  outstanding  debt.  Until the  Company's  lenders are
fully  repaid,  (1) any  new  investments  by the  Company  in its  subsidiaries
(excluding APS) are generally restricted to $15 million in the aggregate and (2)
any other new investments by the Company are generally restricted to $20 million
in the  aggregate.  As of December 31,  1994,  the Company had not made any such
investments.

    As part of the  Company's  1990  debt  restructuring,  the  Company  granted
substantially all of its lenders a security  interest in the outstanding  common
stock of APS pursuant to a Pledge  Agreement,  dated as of January 31, 1990 (the
"Pledge  Agreement").  At  December  31,  1994,  the APS  common  stock  secured
approximately $430 million of the Company's  outstanding debt. Until the Company
and the collateral  agent under the Pledge  Agreement (the  "Collateral  Agent")
receive  notice of the occurrence  and  continuation  of an Event of Default (as
defined in the Pledge Agreement), the Company is entitled to exercise or refrain
from exercising any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the
APS common  stock.  As to matters  other than the  election  of  directors,  the
Company agreed not to exercise or refrain from exercising any such rights if, in
the  Collateral  Agent's  judgment,  such action  would have a material  adverse
effect  on the  value  of the APS  common  stock.  After  notice  of an Event of
Default, the Collateral Agent would have the right to vote the APS common stock.

    REGULATION

    PUBLIC  UTILITY  HOLDING  COMPANY.   The  Company   currently   conducts  no
significant  business  activities  other than investing in its  subsidiaries and
owns no significant assets other than the common stock of its subsidiaries.  The
Company and its subsidiaries are currently  exempt from  registration  under the
Public  Utility  Holding  Company  Act of 1935 (the "1935  Act");  however,  the
Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (the "SEC") has the authority to revoke or
condition an exemption if it appears that any question  exists as to whether the
exemption may be detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors
or consumers.  In May 1990, the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "ACC") filed
a petition  with the SEC  requesting  the SEC to revoke or modify the  Company's
exemption  under the 1935 Act.  To date,  the SEC has not taken any action  with
respect to the ACC petition. The Company cannot predict what action, if any, the
SEC may take with respect to such petition.

    ARIZONA CORPORATION  COMMISSION AFFILIATED INTEREST RULES. On March 14, 1990
the ACC issued an order adopting certain rules purportedly  applicable only to a
certain class of public utilities regulated by the ACC, including APS. The rules
define the terms "public utility holding  company" and "affiliate"  with respect
to  public  service  corporations  regulated  by the ACC in such a manner  as to
include the  Company and all of the  Company's  non-public  service  corporation
subsidiaries.  By their terms,  the rules,  among other things,  require  public
utilities,  such as APS,  to receive  ACC  approval  prior to (1)  obtaining  an
interest in, or  guaranteeing  or assuming the liabilities of, any affiliate not
regulated by the ACC; (2) lending to any such  affiliate  (except for short-term
loans in an amount less than  $100,000);  or (3) using  utility  funds to form a
subsidiary or divest itself of any established subsidiary.  The rules also would
prevent a  utility  from  transacting  business  with an  affiliate  unless  the
affiliate  agrees to provide  the ACC  "access  to the books and  records of the
affiliate  to  the  degree  required  to  fully  audit,   examine  or  otherwise
investigate  transactions  between  the public  utility and the  affiliate."  In
addition, the rules provide that an "affiliate or holding company may not divest
itself of, or otherwise  relinquish  control of, a public utility without thirty
(30) days prior written  notification to the [ACC]" and would require all public
utilities  subject to them and all public utility holding  companies to annually
"provide the [ACC] with a description of  diversification  plans for the current
calendar  year that have been  approved by the Boards of  Directors."  The order
became effective as to APS on December 1, 1992. The rules have not had, nor does
the Company expect the rules to have, a material  adverse impact on the business
or operations of the Company.

                  BUSINESS OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

    Following is a discussion  of the business of APS, the  Company's  principal
subsidiary.

GENERAL

    APS was  incorporated  in 1920  under  the laws of  Arizona  and is  engaged
principally  in  serving  electricity  in the State of  Arizona.  The  principal
executive offices of APS are located at 400 North Fifth Street, Phoenix, Arizona
85004  (telephone  602-250-1000).  APS  currently  employs  approximately  6,535
people, which includes employees assigned to joint projects where APS is project
manager.

    APS serves  approximately  681,000 customers in an area that includes all or
part of 11 of Arizona's 15 counties. During 1994, no single purchaser or user of
energy accounted for more than 3% of total electric revenues.

INDUSTRY AND COMPANY ISSUES

    The  utility  industry  continues  to  experience  a number  of  challenges.
Depending on the  circumstances of a particular  utility,  these may include (i)
competition in general from numerous  sources (see  "Competition"  below);  (ii)
difficulties in meeting government imposed environmental requirements; (iii) the
necessity to make substantial  capital outlays for transmission and distribution
facilities;  (iv) uncertainty  regarding projected electrical demand growth; (v)
controversies over  electromagnetic  fields;  (vi) controversies over the safety
and use of nuclear power; (vii) issues related to spent fuel and low-level waste
(see  "Generating  Fuel"  below);  and  (viii)  increasing  costs of  wages  and
materials.

COMPETITION

    Certain  territory  adjacent to or within  areas  served by APS is served by
other  investor-owned  utilities  (notably Tucson Electric Power Company serving
electricity in the Tucson area, Southwest Gas Corporation serving gas throughout
the state, and Citizens Utilities Company serving electricity and gas in various
locations  throughout the state) and a number of  cooperatives,  municipalities,
electrical   districts,   and  similar  types  of   governmental   organizations
(principally the Salt River Project Agricultural  Improvement and Power District
("SRP") serving electricity in various areas in and around Phoenix).

    Electric   utilities  have  historically   operated  in  a  highly-regulated
environment  that  provides  limited  opportunities  for direct  competition  in
providing electric service to their customers. The National Energy Policy Act of
1992  (the  "Energy  Act")  has  far-reaching  implications  for  APS by  moving
utilities  toward a more  competitive  environment.  The Energy Act is designed,
among  other  things,  to promote  competition  among  utility  and  non-utility
generators by amending the 1935 Act to exempt a new class of  independent  power
producers that are not subject to regulation  under the 1935 Act. The Energy Act
also  amends  the  Federal  Power Act to allow  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory
Commission  ("FERC")  to order  electric  utilities  to  transmit,  or  "wheel,"
wholesale  power for others.  The FERC is  prohibited  under the Energy Act from
requiring  utilities to provide  transmission  access to retail  customers,  and
there remains uncertainty about a state's ability to authorize such transmission
access to and for retail  electric  customers.  

    One of the issues that must be  addressed  responsibly  is the recovery in a
more  competitive  environment of the carrying value of assets  (including those
referred to in Note 1K of the Notes to the Consolidated  Financial Statements in
Item 8) acquired or recorded under the existing regulatory environment. Pursuant
to a 1994  rate  settlement  (see  Note 2 of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements  in Item 8), APS and the ACC staff will  develop  certain  procedures
that are responsive to the competitive forces in larger customer segments,  with
the objective of making joint recommendations to the ACC in 1995. A separate ACC
proceeding on competition was opened in mid-1994 and is expected to continue for
some months.

    As the forces of competition continue to impact the industry, it will become
clearer as to what  customer  sectors and what regions will be most affected and
what strategies are best to deal with those forces. See "Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Competition" in
Item 7 for a discussion of some of APS' strategies.

                                                        ==========    ========

See Notes 4, 5 and 6 of Notes to  the Consolidated Financial  Statements in Item
8.

    On January 12, 1995,  APS issued $75 million of its 10% junior  subordinated
deferrable interest  debentures,  Series A (MIDS), due 2025, and applied the net
proceeds to the repayment of short-term  borrowings  incurred for the redemption
of preferred  stock in 1994. On March 2, 1995,  APS redeemed  $49.15  million in
aggregate  principal amount of APS' First Mortgage Bonds, 10.25% Series due 2000
(the "10.25% Bonds").

    So long as any of APS' first mortgage bonds are outstanding, APS is required
for each  calendar year to deposit with the trustee under its mortgage cash in a
formularized  amount related to net additions to APS'  mortgaged  utility plant;
however,  APS may satisfy all or any part of this "replacement fund" requirement
by utilizing  redeemed or retired  bonds,  net property  additions,  or property
retirements.   For  1994,  the   replacement   fund   requirement   amounted  to
approximately  $125  million.  Many,  though not all, of the bonds issued by APS
under its mortgage are redeemable at their par value plus accrued  interest with
cash deposited by APS in the replacement fund, subject in many cases to a period
of time after the original issuance of the bonds during which they may not be so
redeemed and/or to other restrictions on any such redemption. The cash deposited
with the trustee by APS in partial  satisfaction  of its 1994  replacement  fund
requirements  was used to redeem the 10.25% Bonds at their principal amount plus
accrued interest.

RATES

    STATE.  The ACC has  regulatory  authority  over APS in matters  relating to
retail electric rates and the issuance of securities. See Note 2 of the Notes to
the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in Item 8 for a discussion of the 1994
retail rate settlement agreement between APS and the ACC.

    FEDERAL.  APS' rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services are
subject  to  regulation  by the  FERC.  During  1994,  approximately  6% of APS'
electric  operating  revenues  resulted  from such sales and  charges.  For most
wholesale  transactions  regulated by the FERC, a fuel adjustment clause results
in monthly adjustments for changes in the actual cost of fuel for generation and
in the fuel component of purchased power expense.

CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM

    Present  construction  plans exclude any major baseload  generating  plants.
Utility construction  expenditures for the years 1995 through 1997 are therefore
expected  to  be  primarily  for   expanding   transmission   and   distribution
capabilities to meet customer growth,  upgrading  existing  facilities,  and for
environmental purposes.  Construction  expenditures,  including expenditures for
environmental  control  facilities,  for the years 1995  through  1997 have been
estimated as follows:

                             (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)
BY YEAR                                           BY MAJOR FACILITIES

                             =====                                          $793
                                                                            ====

    The amounts for 1995  through 1997 exclude  capitalized  interest  costs and
capitalized  property  taxes.  These amounts include about $27 million each year
for  nuclear  fuel  expenditures.  APS  conducts  a  continuing  review  of  its
construction  program.  This  program  and the above  estimates  are  subject to
periodic  revisions based upon changes in projections as to system  reliability,
system  load  growth,  rates  of  inflation,  the  availability  and  timing  of
environmental  and other  regulatory  approvals,  the  availability and costs of
outside  sources of  capital,  and  changes in project  construction  schedules.
During the years 1992 through 1994, APS incurred  approximately  $728 million in
construction   expenditures   and   approximately   $31  million  in  additional
capitalized items.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

    Pursuant to the Clean Air Act, the United  States  Environmental  Protection
Agency    ("EPA")   has    adopted    regulations,    applicable    to   certain
federally-protected  areas,  that  address  visibility  impairment  that  can be
reasonably  attributed to specific sources.  In September 1991, the EPA issued a
final rule that would limit sulfur  dioxide  emissions at the Navajo  Generating
Station ("NGS").  Compliance with the emission  limitation becomes applicable to
NGS  Units 1, 2, and 3 in 1997,  1998,  and  1999,  respectively.  SRP,  the NGS
operating  agent,  has estimated a capital cost of $500  million,  most of which
will be incurred from 1995-1998,  and annual operations and maintenance costs of
approximately   $14  million  for  all  three  units,  for  NGS  to  meet  these
requirements. APS will be required to fund 14% of these expenditures.

    The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the "Amendments")  became effective on
November 15, 1990.  The  Amendments  address,  among other things,  "acid rain,"
visibility  in  certain   specified  areas,   toxic  air  pollutants,   and  the
nonattainment of national ambient air quality  standards.  With respect to "acid
rain,"  the  Amendments   establish  a  system  of  sulfur   dioxide   emissions
"allowances."  Each  existing  utility  unit is  granted  a  certain  number  of
"allowances."  On March 5, 1993,  the EPA  promulgated  rules listing  allowance
allocations  applicable to APS-owned plants, which allocations will begin in the
year 2000. Based on those  allocations,  APS will have sufficient  allowances to
permit  continued  operation of its plants at current levels without  installing
additional  equipment.  In  addition,  the  Amendments  require  the  EPA to set
nitrogen  oxides emissions  limitations  which would require  certain  plants to
install  additional  pollution  control  equipment.  On March 22, 1994,  the EPA
issued rules for nitrogen oxides emissions limitations; however, on November 29,
1994,  the United  States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  Circuit
vacated the rules and remanded  them to the EPA for further  consideration.  The
EPA has not yet proposed revised rules.

    With respect to protection of visibility  in certain  specified  areas,  the
Amendments  require  the EPA to  complete a study by  November  1995  concerning
visibility  impairment in those areas and identification of sources contributing
to such  impairment.  Interim  findings  of this study have  indicated  that any
beneficial effect on visibility as a result of the Amendments would be offset by
expected population and industry growth. The EPA has established a "Grand Canyon
Visibility  Transport  Commission"  to  complete  a study  by  November  1995 on
visibility  impairment in the "Golden Circle of National  Parks" in the Colorado
Plateau.  NGS, the Cholla  Power Plant  ("Cholla"),  and the Four Corners  Power
Plant ("Four  Corners") are located near the "Golden Circle of National  Parks."
Based on the  recommendations of the Commission,  the EPA may require additional
emissions  controls at various  sources  causing  visibility  impairment  in the
"Golden Circle of National Parks" and may limit economic  development in several
western states. APS cannot currently estimate the capital expenditures,  if any,
which  may be  required  as a result  of the EPA  studies  and the  Commission's
recommendations.

    With respect to hazardous air pollutants  emitted by electric  utility steam
generating units, the Amendments  require two studies.  The results of the first
study  indicated  an impact from  mercury  emissions  from such units in certain
unspecified areas;  however, the EPA has not yet stated whether or not emissions
limitations  will be imposed.  Next,  the EPA will  complete a general  study by
November  1995  concerning  the  necessity  of  regulating  such units under the
Amendments. Due to the lack of historical data, and because APS cannot speculate
as to the ultimate  requirements by the EPA, APS cannot  currently  estimate the
capital  expenditures,  if any,  which  may be  required  as a  result  of these
studies.

    Certain aspects of the Amendments may require  related  expenditures by APS,
such as permit fees,  none of which APS expects to have a material impact on its
financial position.



    Other includes oil and hydro generation.

    APS  believes  that  Cholla  has  sufficient  reserves  of low  sulfur  coal
committed to that plant for the next five years,  the term of the existing  coal
contract.  Sufficient  reserves  of low sulfur  coal are  available  to continue
operating  Cholla for its useful life.  APS also  believes that Four Corners and
NGS have  sufficient  reserves  of low sulfur  coal  available  for use by those
plants to continue  operating  them for their useful lives.  The current  sulfur
content of coal being used at Four  Corners,  NGS,  and Cholla is  approximately
0.8%,  0.6%,  and 0.4%,  respectively.  In 1994,  average  prices  paid for coal
supplied from reserves  dedicated  under the existing  contracts were relatively
stable,  although  applicable  contract clauses permit escalations under certain
conditions.  In addition, major price adjustments can occur from time to time as
a result of contract renegotiation.

    NGS and Four  Corners are located on the Navajo  Reservation  and held under
easements  granted by the federal  government  as well as leases from the Navajo
Tribe.  See  "Properties"  in Item 2. APS  purchases all of the coal which fuels
Four Corners from a coal supplier with a long-term  lease of coal reserves owned
by the Navajo Tribe and for NGS from a coal supplier with a long-term lease with
the Navajo and Hopi  Tribes.  APS  purchases  all of the coal which fuels Cholla
from a coal  supplier who mines all of the coal under a long-term  lease of coal
reserves  owned  by the  Navajo  Tribe,  the  federal  government,  and  private
landholders.

    APS is a party to  contracts  with 26 natural gas  operators  and  marketers
which allow APS to purchase  natural gas in the method it  determines to be most
economic. During 1994, the principal sources of APS' natural gas generating fuel
were 21 of these  companies.  APS is  currently  purchasing  the majority of its
natural gas  requirements  from twelve  companies  pursuant to  contracts.  APS'
natural  gas supply is  transported  pursuant to a firm  transportation  service
contract  between APS and El Paso Natural Gas Company.  APS continues to analyze
the  market to  determine  the source and  method of  meeting  its  natural  gas
requirements.

    The fuel cycle for the Palo Verde Nuclear  Generating Station ("Palo Verde")
is comprised of the following stages:  (1) the mining and milling of uranium ore
to produce uranium  concentrates,  (2) the conversion of uranium concentrates to
uranium  hexafluoride,  (3) the  enrichment  of  uranium  hexafluoride,  (4) the
fabrication  of fuel  assemblies,  (5) the  utilization  of fuel  assemblies  in
reactors,  and (6) the storage of spent fuel and the disposal thereof.  The Palo
Verde  participants  have made  arrangements  through contract  flexibilities to
obtain quantities of uranium  concentrates  anticipated to be sufficient to meet
operational  requirements  through 1997. Existing contracts and options could be
utilized to meet  approximately  80% of requirements in 1998 and 1999 and 70% of
requirements  from 2000 through 2002.  Spot purchases in the uranium market will
be made, as appropriate,  in lieu of any uranium that might be obtained  through
contract  flexibilities and options. The Palo Verde participants have contracted
for all conversion services required through 2000 and with options for up to 70%
through 2002.  The Palo Verde  participants,  including  APS, have an enrichment
services  contract  with United States  Enrichment  Corporation  ("USEC")  which
obligates USEC to furnish enrichment  services required for the operation of the
three Palo Verde units over a term expiring in September  2002,  with options to
continue through  September 2007. In addition,  existing  contracts will provide
fuel  assembly  fabrication  services  for at least ten  years  from the date of
operation of each Palo Verde unit, and through contract  options,  approximately
fifteen  additional  years are available.  The Energy Act includes an assessment
for  decontamination  and  decommissioning  of the enrichment  facilities of the
United States Department of Energy ("DOE").  The total amount of this assessment
that APS expects for Palo Verde will be  approximately $3 million per year, plus
escalation for inflation,  for fifteen years  beginning in 1993. APS is required
to fund 29.1% of this assessment.

    Existing  spent  fuel  storage  facilities  at Palo  Verde  have  sufficient
capacity with certain  modifications to store all fuel expected to be discharged
from normal  operation  of all Palo Verde units  through at least the year 2005.
Pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987 (the "Waste
Act"),  DOE is  obligated  to accept and dispose of all spent  nuclear  fuel and
other  high-level  radioactive  wastes generated by all domestic power reactors.
The Nuclear Regulatory  Commission (the "NRC"),  pursuant to the Waste Act, also
requires  operators of nuclear power  reactors to enter into spent fuel disposal
contracts with DOE. APS, on its own behalf and on behalf of the other Palo Verde
participants,  has executed a spent fuel  disposal  contract with DOE. The Waste
Act also  obligates  DOE to develop the  facilities  necessary for the permanent
disposal of all spent fuel  generated,  and to be generated,  by domestic  power
reactors  and to have  the  first  such  facility  in  operation  by 1998  under
prescribed  procedures.  In November  1989,  DOE  reported  that such  permanent
disposal facility will not be in operation until 2010. As a result,  under DOE's
current  criteria  for  shipping  allocation  rights,  Palo  Verde's  spent fuel
shipments to the DOE permanent  disposal  facility would begin in  approximately
2025.  In  addition,  APS  believes  that  on-site  storage of spent fuel may be
required  beyond  the  life of Palo  Verde's  generating  units.  APS  currently
believes  that  alternative  interim  spent fuel storage  methods are or will be
available  on-site  or  off-site  for use by Palo  Verde to allow its  continued
operation  beyond  2005 and to safely  store  spent fuel until  DOE's  scheduled
shipments from Palo Verde begin.

    There are no  existing  off-site  facilities  for  storage  or  disposal  of
low-level waste available for Palo Verde, so the waste is currently being stored
on-site until an off-site  location becomes  available.  APS currently  believes
that interim low-level waste storage methods are or will be available for use by
Palo Verde to allow its continued  operation and to safely store low-level waste
until a permanent disposal facility is available.

    While  believing that  scientific  and financial  aspects of the issues with
respect  to  fuel  and  low-level  waste  can be  resolved  satisfactorily,  APS
acknowledges  that their ultimate  resolution will require political resolve and
action on national and regional scales which it is less able to predict.

PALO VERDE NUCLEAR GENERATING STATION

    REGULATORY.  Operation  of each of the three Palo Verde  units  requires  an
operating  license from the NRC. Full power  operating  licenses for Units 1, 2,
and 3 were  issued by the NRC in June  1985,  April  1986,  and  November  1987,
respectively.  The full  power  operating  licenses,  each valid for a period of
approximately  40 years,  authorize APS, as operating  agent for Palo Verde,  to
operate the three Palo Verde units at full power.

    STEAM GENERATORS.  See "Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station" in Note 11 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of
issues relating to the Palo Verde steam generators.

    PALO  VERDE  LIABILITY  AND  INSURANCE  MATTERS.  See  "Palo  Verde  Nuclear
Generating  Station"  in  Note 11 of the  Notes  to the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements in Item 8 for a discussion  of the  insurance  maintained by the Palo
Verde participants, including APS, for Palo Verde.

    DEPARTMENT  OF LABOR MATTER.  By letter dated July 7, 1993,  the NRC advised
APS that,  as a result of a  Recommended  Decision and Order by a Department  of
Labor  Administrative  Law Judge  (the  "ALJ")  finding  that APS  discriminated
against  a  former  contract  employee  at Palo  Verde  because  he  engaged  in
"protected activities" (as defined under federal regulations),  the NRC intended
to schedule an enforcement conference with APS. Following the ALJ's finding, APS
investigated various elements of both the substantive allegations and the manner
in which the United  States  Department  of Labor (the "DOL")  proceedings  were
conducted.  As a result of that  investigation,  APS determined  that one of its
employees  had  falsely  testified  during  the  proceedings,  that  there  were
inconsistencies in the testimony of another employee, and that certain documents
were  requested  in, but not provided  during,  discovery.  The two employees in
question are no longer with APS.  APS provided the results of its  investigation
to the ALJ, who referred matters relating to the conduct of two former employees
of APS to the United States Attorney's office in Phoenix,  Arizona.  On December
15,  1993,  APS and the former  contract  employee  who had raised the DOL claim
entered into a  settlement  agreement,  which was  approved by the  Secretary of
Labor on March 21, 1994. On May 19, 1994,  the Secretary of Labor  rescinded the
March 21, 1994 order and remanded the matter to the  responsible  Administrative
Law Judges for  clarification.  On August 9, 1994,  and September 20, 1994,  the
Administrative  Law Judges again  recommended to the Secretary of Labor that the
settlement be approved.  By letter dated August 10, 1993,  APS also provided the
results of its  investigation  to the NRC, and advised the NRC that, as a result
of APS'  investigation,  APS had changed its  position  opposing  the finding of
discrimination.   The  NRC  is  investigating  this  matter  and  APS  is  fully
cooperating with the NRC in this regard.

WATER SUPPLY

    Assured  supplies  of water are  important  both to APS (for its  generating
plants) and to its customers.  However, conflicting claims to limited amounts of
water in the southwestern  United States have resulted in numerous court actions
in recent years.

    Both  groundwater  and surface water in areas  important to APS'  operations
have been the subject of inquiries,  claims,  and legal  proceedings  which will
require a number of years to  resolve.  APS is one of a number of  parties  in a
proceeding  before a state court in New Mexico to adjudicate  rights to a stream
system from which water for Four  Corners is derived.  (State of New Mexico,  in
the relation of S.E. Reynolds,  State Engineer v. United States of America, City
of Farmington,  Utah  International,  Inc., et al., San Juan County, New Mexico,
District Court No. 75-184).  An agreement reached with the Navajo Tribe in 1985,
however,  provides  that if Four  Corners  loses a portion  of its rights in the
adjudication,  the Tribe will provide,  for a then-agreed upon cost,  sufficient
water from its allocation to offset the loss.

    A summons  served on APS in early 1986  required all water  claimants in the
Lower Gila River Watershed in Arizona to assert any claims to water on or before
January 20, 1987, in an action pending in Maricopa County Superior Court. (In re
The General Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water in the Gila River System and
Source,  Supreme Court Nos. WC-79-0001 through WC 79-0004  (Consolidated) [WC-1,
WC-2, WC-3 and WC-4 (Consolidated)],  Maricopa County Nos. W-1, W-2, W-3 and W-4
(Consolidated)). Palo Verde is located within the geographic area subject to the
summons,  and the rights of the Palo Verde  participants,  including APS, to the
use of  groundwater  and effluent at Palo Verde is  potentially at issue in this
action.  APS, as project  manager of Palo Verde,  filed  claims that dispute the
court's  jurisdiction over the Palo Verde  participants'  groundwater rights and
their contractual rights to effluent relating to Palo Verde and,  alternatively,
seek confirmation of such rights.  Three of APS' less-utilized  power plants are
also located  within the  geographic  area  subject to the summons.  APS' claims
dispute the court's  jurisdiction  over APS' groundwater  rights with respect to
these plants and,  alternatively,  seek confirmation of such rights. On December
10, 1992,  the Arizona  Supreme Court heard oral  argument on certain  issues in
this matter which are pending on interlocutory  appeal. Issues important to APS'
claims were  remanded to the trial court for further  action and the trial court
certified its decision for interlocutory appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court. On
September 28, 1994, the Arizona  Supreme Court granted review of the trial court
decision.  No trial date  concerning the water rights claims of APS has been set
in this matter.

    APS has also filed claims to water in the Little Colorado River Watershed in
Arizona in an action  pending in the Apache County  Superior  Court.  (In re The
General  Adjudication  of All Rights to Use Water in the Little  Colorado  River
System and Source,  Supreme Court No.  WC-79-0006 WC-6, Apache County No. 6417).
APS'  groundwater  resource  utilized  at Cholla is within the  geographic  area
subject to the adjudication  and is therefore  potentially at issue in the case.
APS' claims dispute the court's  jurisdiction over APS' groundwater  rights and,
alternatively,  seek confirmation of such rights. The parties are in the process
of settlement negotiations with respect to this matter. No trial date concerning
the water rights claims of APS has been set in this matter.

    Although the foregoing  matters  remain subject to further  evaluation,  APS
expects that the described  litigation will not have a materially adverse impact
on its operations or financial position.

                     BUSINESS OF NON-UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES

                          SUNCOR DEVELOPMENT COMPANY

    SunCor was  incorporated  in 1965 under the laws of the State of Arizona and
is engaged primarily in the owning,  holding,  and development of real property.
The  principal  executive  offices of SunCor are located at 2828 North  Central,
Suite 900,  Phoenix,  Arizona  85004  (telephone  602-285-6800).  SunCor and its
subsidiaries,   excluding  SunCor  Resort  &  Golf  Management,   Inc.  ("Resort
Management"),  employ approximately 78 persons. Resort Management, which manages
the Wigwam Resort and Country Club (the  "Wigwam"),  employs between 400 and 715
persons,  depending on the Wigwam's  operating  season.  Resort  Management also
operates other golf operations.

    SunCor's assets consist  primarily of land and  improvements  and other real
estate investments. SunCor's holdings include approximately 11,000 acres west of
Phoenix  in the  area of  Goodyear/Litchfield  Park,  Arizona  ("Palm  Valley"),
including a private water and sewer company to provide those utility services to
the property.  A substantial  portion of the  undeveloped  property is currently
being used for agricultural  purposes.  SunCor has completed the master-plan for
developing Palm Valley and has begun  commercial and residential  development of
approximately  640 acres.  The initial  phase  included  the  development  of an
18-hole championship golf course that was completed in 1993. In addition, within
the Palm Valley project, SunCor has entered into joint ventures to develop 2,200
acres as a  retirement  community,  known  as  PebbleCreek,  and 350  acres as a
planned area development, known as Litchfield Greens.

    SunCor's holdings also include a 1,400 acre  master-planned  community north
of Phoenix called Tatum Ranch, a 1,400 acre  master-planned  community northeast
of Phoenix called Scottsdale  Mountain,  a 140 acre  master-planned  project for
business use northwest of Phoenix  called  Talavi and a 420 acre  master-planned
project for business use east of Phoenix called MarketPlace.

    For the years ended December 31, 1994,  1993, and 1992,  SunCor's  operating
revenues were  approximately  $59.3 million,  $32.2 million,  and $20.0 million,
respectively,  and its pre-tax income (losses) were  approximately $0.5 million,
($4.0 million), and ($6.2 million), respectively. SunCor's capital needs consist
primarily of  construction  expenditures,  which are expected to approximate $35
million,  $31 million,  and $11 million for 1995, 1996, and 1997,  respectively,
based on existing  holdings.  See "The Company -- Capital  Requirements" in this
Item for a  discussion  of  restrictions  on the  Company's  ability to make new
investments in SunCor.

    At December 31, 1994, SunCor had total assets of approximately $435 million,
approximately $269 million of which has been pledged to secure certain long-term
debt of SunCor. See Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated  Financial Statements in
Item 8 for information  regarding  SunCor's  long-term  debt.  SunCor intends to
continue its focus on real estate  development in residential,  commercial,  and
industrial projects.

                         EL DORADO INVESTMENT COMPANY

    El Dorado  was  incorporated  in 1983 under the laws of the State of Arizona
and is engaged in the business of making equity  investments in other companies.
El  Dorado's  offices  are  located  at 400 East Van Buren  Street,  Suite  750,
Phoenix, Arizona 85004 (telephone 602-252-3441).

    El Dorado  has  investments  in three  major  venture  capital  partnerships
totalling   approximately   $24.3  million.  El  Dorado  has  remaining  funding
commitments to these  partnerships in the aggregate  amount of  approximately $4
million through 1995. In addition to the foregoing investments,  through 1994 El
Dorado had directly  invested  approximately  $20.5 million in other private and
public companies and partnerships with perceived high growth potential.

    For the years ended December 31, 1994,  1993,  and 1992 El Dorado's  pre-tax
losses  were  approximately  $4.0  million,  $3.9  million,  and  $2.6  million,
respectively.  At December 31, 1994, El Dorado had total assets of approximately
$53  million.  See "The  Company  --  Capital  Requirements"  in this Item for a

----------
  (1)   West Phoenix steam units (96,300 kW) are currently mothballed.

                                 --------------

    APS' peak  one-hour  demand on its electric  system was recorded on June 29,
1994 at  4,214,000  kW,  compared to the 1993 peak of  3,802,300  kW recorded on
August 2. Taking into account  additional  capacity  then  available to it under
purchase power contracts as well as its own generating capacity, APS' capability
of meeting system demand on June 29, 1994,  computed in accordance with accepted
industry practices, amounted to 4,514,300 kW, for an installed reserve margin of
8.1%. The power  actually  available to APS from its resources  fluctuates  from
time to time  due in  part  to  planned  outages  and  technical  problems.  The
available  capacity from sources actually  operable at the time of the 1994 peak
amounted to 4,193,500 kW, for a margin of -0.5%. Firm purchases from neighboring
utilities  totaling  550  megawatts  were in place at the time of the 1994 peak,
ensuring the Company's ability to meet the load requirement.

    NGS and Four  Corners  are  located  on land held under  easements  from the
federal  government  and also under leases from the Navajo Tribe.  The risk with
respect to enforcement of these  easements and leases is not deemed by APS to be
material.  APS is dependent,  however,  in some measure upon the willingness and
ability  of  the  Navajo  Tribe  to  honor  its  commitments.  Certain  of  APS'
transmission  lines and  almost  all of its  contracted  coal  sources  are also
located on Indian reservations. See "Generating Fuel" in Item 1.

    On August 18, 1986 and December 19, 1986,  APS entered into a total of three
sale  and   leaseback   transactions   under  which  it  sold  and  leased  back
approximately  42% of its 29.1%  ownership  interest  in Palo  Verde Unit 2. The
leases under each of the sale and  leaseback  transactions  have  initial  lease
terms  expiring  on  December  31,  2015.  Each of the leases also allows APS to
extend the term of the lease  and/or to  repurchase  the leased  Unit 2 interest
under certain  circumstances  at fair market value.  The leases in the aggregate
require annual payments of approximately $40 million through 1999, approximately
$46 million in 2000, and  approximately  $49 million through 2015 (see Note 9 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8).

    See "Water Supply" in Item 1 with respect to matters having  possible impact
on the operation of certain of APS' power plants, including Palo Verde.

    APS'  construction  plans are  susceptible to changes in forecasts of future
demand on its  electric  system and in its ability to finance  its  construction
program.  Although its plans are subject to change,  present  construction plans
exclude any major baseload  generating plants.  Important factors affecting APS'
ability to delay the  construction of new major  generating units are continuing
efforts to upgrade and improve the reliability of existing generating  stations,
system load diversity with other utilities,  and continuing  efforts in customer
demand-side conservation and load management programs.

    In  addition  to that  available  from  its  own  generating  capacity,  APS
purchases  electricity from other utilities under various  arrangements.  One of
the most  important  of these is a  long-term  contract  with SRP  which  may be
canceled by SRP on three years' notice and which requires SRP to make available,
and APS to pay for,  certain amounts of electricity that are based in large part
on customer  demand within certain areas now served by APS pursuant to a related
territorial  agreement.  APS  believes  that the prices  payable by it under the
contract are fair to both  parties.  The  generating  capacity  available to APS
pursuant  to the  contract  was  304,000  kW until May 1994,  at which  time the
capacity  increased to 313,000 kW. In 1994, APS received  approximately  887,650
Megawatt  hours (MWh) of energy under the contract  and paid  approximately  $40
million for capacity availability and energy received.

    In September 1990, APS and  PacifiCorp,  an  Oregon-based  utility  company,
entered into certain agreements  relating  principally to sales and purchases of
electric power and electric  utility assets,  and in July 1991, after regulatory
approvals,  APS sold Cholla Unit 4 to PacifiCorp for approximately $230 million.
As part of the transaction,  PacifiCorp agreed to make a firm system sale to APS
for thirty years  during APS' summer peak season in the amount of 175  megawatts
for the first five years, increasing thereafter, at APS' option, up to a maximum
amount equal to the rated capacity of Cholla Unit 4. After the first five years,
all or part of the sale may be  converted  to a  one-for-one  seasonal  capacity
exchange.  PacifiCorp  has the  right to  purchase  from  APS up to 125  average
megawatts of energy per year for thirty years.  PacifiCorp  and APS also entered
into a 100 megawatt  one-for-one seasonal capacity exchange to be effective upon
the latter of  January 1, 1996 or the  completion  of certain  new  transmission
projects.  In  addition,  PacifiCorp  agreed  to pay APS (i)  $20  million  upon
commercial operation of 150 megawatts of peaking capacity constructed by APS and
(ii) $19 million ($9.5  million of which has been paid) in  connection  with the
construction of transmission  lines and upgrades that will afford PacifiCorp 150
megawatts of northbound  transmission  rights. In addition,  PacifiCorp  secured
additional firm transmission  capacity of 30 megawatts,  for which approximately
$0.5 million was paid during 1994. In 1994,  APS received  389,110 MWh of energy
from PacifiCorp under these  transactions and paid approximately $18 million for
capacity availability and the energy received, and PacifiCorp paid approximately
$0.5 million for approximately 32,000 MWh.

                          ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

APS

    On June 29, 1990, a new Arizona  state tax law was enacted,  effective as of
December 31, 1989,  which  adversely  impacted  APS'  earnings in tax years 1990
through  1994 by an  aggregate  amount of  approximately  $21  million per year,
before  income  taxes.  On  December  20,  1990,  the Palo  Verde  participants,
including  APS,  filed a lawsuit in the  Arizona  Tax Court,  a division  of the
Maricopa County Superior Court,  against the Arizona Department of Revenue,  the
Treasurer of the State of Arizona, and various Arizona counties, claiming, among
other things,  that portions of the new tax law are  unconstitutional.  (Arizona
Public  Service  Company,  et al. v.  Apache  County,  et al.,  No. TX  90-01686
(Consol.),  Maricopa County Superior Court). In December 1992, the court granted
summary   judgment  to  the  taxing   authorities,   holding  that  the  law  is
constitutional.  APS has appealed this decision to the Arizona Court of Appeals.
APS cannot currently predict the ultimate outcome of this matter.

    See "Water Supply" and "Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station" in Item 1 and
"El  Paso  Electric  Company  Bankruptcy"  in  Note  11  of  the  Notes  to  the
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in Item 8 in  regard  to other  pending  or
threatened litigation involving APS.

PINNACLE WEST

    A lawsuit was filed in the United States  District Court for the District of
Arizona against the Company, its inside directors and certain of its officers on
November  7, 1988 and was  amended on  December  15,  1988 to add the  remaining
directors and additional  substantive claims. As amended,  the complaint alleges
violations of federal securities laws and Arizona securities, consumer fraud and
other  state  laws  in  connection  with  certain  actions  of the  Company  and
statements  made  on  its  behalf  relating  to  the  Company's  diversification
activities, future business prospects and dividends. The Court certified a class
consisting of all purchasers of the Company's common stock between April 1, 1987
and  October  7,  1988  (the  alleged  "Class  Period").  The  complaint  sought
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages as well as fees and costs.

    On December 20, 1988 a lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court
for the  District  of Arizona  against the  Company  and  certain  officers  and
directors,   alleging   violations  of  federal   securities  laws  and  Arizona
securities,  consumer  fraud and other  state laws in  connection  with  certain
actions  of the  Company  and  statements  made on its  behalf  relating  to the
Company's diversification  activities,  future business prospects and dividends.
The lawsuit is substantially  similar to the lawsuit referenced in the preceding
paragraph.  The  plaintiffs,  two  individuals  who claim to have  purchased the
Company's  common stock  between  April 1, 1987 and October 7, 1988 (the alleged
"Class Period"), requested unspecified compensatory and punitive damages as well
as fees and  costs.  On October 2,  1989,  the cases  described  in this and the
preceding paragraph were consolidated.

    On  December  15,  1989 a  shareholder  derivative  lawsuit was filed in the
United States  District  Court for the District of Arizona  naming the Company's
directors  as  defendants  and the  Company as nominal  defendant.  The  lawsuit
alleges  breach of  fiduciary  duties by the  directors in  connection  with the
Company's diversification  activities,  and further alleges violation of federal
securities  laws by one director in connection  with the sale of MeraBank to the
Company in 1986. The plaintiffs requested, on the Company's behalf,  unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages.

    On April 22, 1991 a lawsuit was filed in the United  States  District  Court
for the  District of Arizona by the  Resolution  Trust  Corporation  (the "RTC")
against  certain  former  officers and  directors of MeraBank.  The suit sought,
among other things,  damages in excess of $270 million,  and alleged negligence,
gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty of loyalty and breach
of contract  with  respect to the  management  and  operation of MeraBank by the
defendants  beginning  in the  early  1980s.  Although  the  Company  was  not a
defendant,  the  Company  agreed  to  advance  reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and
expenses,  in various  amounts,  to those  defendants who served on the MeraBank
Board of Directors at the request of the Company. The Company reserved the right
to alter the amount of such advances or to terminate them as the case developed,
and has also received  undertakings  from the persons receiving such advances to
repay such amounts in the event that they are  ultimately  determined  not to be
entitled to indemnification.  The Company has terminated future such advances as
to certain of those  defendants.  In addition,  in June and November of 1989 the
Company's Board of Directors adopted  resolutions  whereby the Company agreed to
indemnify the  non-officer  members of the MeraBank  Board of Directors  against
claims  brought  against  such  individuals  in their  capacity as  directors of
MeraBank,  for acts  occurring on or after June and November 1989, the effective
dates of the indemnification resolutions.

    On December 30,  1993,  and as the result of a  negotiated  settlement,  the
United  States  District  Court for the District of Arizona  entered  orders and
final judgments (1) dismissing the consolidated shareholder class litigation and
shareholder derivative litigation initiated in 1988 and 1989, respectively,  and
described in the first three  paragraphs  under this  heading and (2)  partially
dismissing the litigation  initiated by the RTC and described in the immediately
preceding  paragraph.  The  settlement  provides for payments  totaling  $61.625
million,  of which the Company's  share is $5.75 million.  A litigation  reserve
previously established by the Company is sufficient to cover the Company's share
of the settlement.  The balance of the settlement  payment will be funded by the
Company's insurers. Two non-settling  individuals who pursued independent claims
against the RTC were not dismissed from the RTC litigation and have appealed the
settlement.  On March 23, 1995, the appeals court affirmed the judgment  entered
by the District Court which approved the settlement and dismissed the litigation
described above. The non-settling individuals have filed a third-party complaint
against the Company in the District  Court for the District of Arizona  alleging
claims for  contractual  and statutory  indemnification  in the event that these
individuals  are found liable on the RTC's claims against them. The  third-party
complaint,  which has not been served on the Company,  further  alleges that the
Company  acted in bad  faith  and  wrongfully  denied  indemnification  to these
individuals and seeks compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount
as well as costs and  attorneys'  fees.  In addition,  one of these  individuals
seeks a judicial  determination that the Company is obligated to pay him pension
benefits in an  unspecified  amount in the event that the RTC does not fully pay
these benefits.  The Company  believes that it has no obligation with respect to
any such costs or damages.

    On January 18, 1991 a lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court,
Southern District of Ohio, Western Division,  against,  among other parties, the
Company  and  certain  of its  officers  and  directors,  the  Office  of Thrift
Supervision  ("OTS"),  the RTC and the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation
("FDIC").  The amended  complaint  in this lawsuit  alleges  that the  plaintiff
purchased MeraBank  subordinated  debentures with a face amount of $1 million in
1987 in reliance upon a capital maintenance  stipulation executed by the Company
as a condition to the Company's  acquisition of MeraBank.  The plaintiff further
alleges that the value of such debentures was impaired  because of the Company's
release from its purported  obligations under the stipulation and the actions of
the OTS in placing  MeraBank  in  receivership.  The amended  complaint  alleges
claims under the federal securities laws, the federal racketeering statutes, and
state  consumer fraud  statutes and seeks damages in the  approximate  amount of
$4.8 million.  On August 2, 1991 the Ohio court issued an order  dismissing  the
case with  prejudice as to the Company and the  officer/director  defendants for
lack of personal  jurisdiction.  The court also ordered the case  dismissed with
prejudice as to the OTS, the RTC and the FDIC.  On October 1, 1991 the plaintiff
appealed the court's  order.  On February 17, 1993,  the United  States Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the entry of summary judgment in favor of
the RTC, OTS, and FDIC, but reversed the district court's  dismissal in favor of
the Company  and certain of its  officers  and  directors.  The Court of Appeals
remanded  the case to the  district  court for a  determination  of whether  the
plaintiff  had  adequately  pled its  claims so that the  district  court  could
exercise  personal  jurisdiction.  The district court was further  instructed to
consider  whether the  Southern  District  of Ohio was the proper  venue for the
suit. On June 8, 1993, the Ohio court ordered this case to be transferred to the
District of Arizona.  On August 17, 1993, the Company was served with a separate
complaint  filed by the same plaintiff in the District Court for the District of
Arizona  alleging  claims  under the  Arizona  Racketeering  Act and the Arizona
Consumer  Fraud Act seeking  compensatory  damages in the amount of $1.2 million
plus interest,  punitive damages, treble damages, interest,  attorneys' fees and
costs.  On September 24, 1993, the plaintiff  voluntarily  dismissed the Arizona
Consumer  Fraud Act claims.  On March 6, 1995,  the court  dismissed the Arizona
Racketeering Act claims.  The federal  securities law, federal  racketeering and
state  consumer  fraud claims  remain  pending.  The Company and the  individual
directors  and  officers  believe  that the  lawsuit is  without  merit and will
vigorously defend themselves.

    On May 1, 1991, a lawsuit was filed in the United States  District Court for
the  District of Arizona  against the Company by another  purchaser  of the same
issue  of  MeraBank  subordinated  debentures  referred  to in  the  immediately
preceding   paragraph.   This  plaintiff  also  claims  to  have  purchased  the
debentures,  with a face amount of approximately $12.4 million, in reliance upon
the stipulation. The suit further alleges that the Company induced the plaintiff
to retain its investment in the debentures by representing to the plaintiff that
the  Company  would  keep  MeraBank   capitalized  in  accordance  with  federal
regulatory  requirements.  The suit  alleges  violations  of  federal  and state
securities laws, fraud, negligent  representation,  racketeering and intentional
interference with contractual relations. On October 7, 1994, the court dismissed
the plaintiff's  federal securities law claims.  Motions for  reconsideration of
the court's ruling are pending. The plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory and
punitive  damages and has  requested  that the  compensatory  damages be trebled
under Arizona's civil  racketeering  statute.  The Company intends to vigorously
defend itself in this action.

    On December 22, 1993, the Company was served with a complaint filed by other
purchasers  of  MeraBank   subordinated   debentures   with  a  face  amount  of
approximately $1.5 million alleging claims  substantially  similar to the claims
described  in the  preceding  paragraph.  The  complaint  which was filed in the
United States District Court for the District of Arizona, seeks compensatory and
punitive  damages in an unspecified  amount plus attorneys' fees and costs.  The
Company intends to vigorously defend itself in this action.

           ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
                      CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

        The following  discussion  relates to Pinnacle West Capital  Corporation
(Pinnacle  West) and its  subsidiaries:  Arizona Public  Service  Company (APS),
SunCor  Development  Company  (SunCor)  and El  Dorado  Investment  Company  (El
Dorado). The discussion also relates to the discontinued operations of MeraBank,
A Federal Savings Bank  (MeraBank).  

CAPITAL NEEDS AND RESOURCES  

Parent Company

        During the past three years, Pinnacle West's primary cash needs were for
the payment of interest and the optional and mandatory repayment of principal on
its long-term debt (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements).
Additional  cash  needs in 1993 and 1994  were  related  to the  resumption  and
subsequent growth of common stock dividends.

        Dividends from APS have been Pinnacle West's primary source of cash. Tax
allocations  within the consolidated  group and net operating loss carryforwards
associated  primarily  with  MeraBank  have also been  sources  of cash.  

        SunCor provided cash in 1994, and SunCor and El Dorado are both expected
to contribute to Pinnacle West's cash flow in 1995.

        Pinnacle West repaid  substantial  amounts of its  parent-level  debt in
each  of the  last  three  years.  Management  expects  Pinnacle  West  to  have
sufficient cash flow to reduce parent company debt to approximately $310 million
at the end of 1995 from $430 million at the end of 1994.  

APS 

        APS' capital needs consist  primarily of construction  expenditures  and
optional and mandatory repayments or redemptions of long-term debt and preferred
stock. The capital resources available to meet these requirements  include funds
provided by operations and external financings.

        Present  construction plans do not include any major baseload generating
plants.  In general,  most of the  construction  expenditures  are for expanding
transmission  and distribution  capabilities to meet customer growth,  upgrading
existing facilities and for environmental  purposes.  Construction  expenditures
are anticipated to be approximately $300 million,  $257 million and $236 million
for 1995, 1996 and 1997,  respectively.  These amounts include about $27 million
each year for nuclear fuel expenditures.

        In the period  1992  through  1994,  APS funded all of its  construction
expenditures  and capitalized  property taxes with funds provided by operations,
after the payment of dividends.  For the period 1995 through 1997, APS estimates
that it will fund substantially all such expenditures in the same manner.

        During 1994, APS repurchased or redeemed  approximately  $587 million of
long-term  debt and preferred  stock,  of which  approximately  $518 million was
optional.   Refunding  obligations  for  preferred  stock,   long-term  debt,  a
capitalized  lease  obligation and certain  anticipated  early  redemptions  are
expected to total  approximately  $106 million,  $4 million and $164 million for
the years 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively.  On March 2, 1995, APS redeemed all
of its  outstanding  first  mortgage  bonds,  10.25% Series due 2000 (the 10.25%
Bonds) for approximately $50 million.

        APS  currently  expects to issue up to $175 million of debt in 1995.  Of
this  amount,  on  January  12,  1995,  APS  issued  $75  million  of 10% junior
subordinated deferrable interest debentures (MIDS) due 2025, and applied the net
proceeds to the  repayment  of  short-term  debt that had been  incurred for the
redemption of preferred stock in 1994. APS expects that substantially all of the
net proceeds of the  remaining  financing  activity in 1995 will be used for the
retirement of outstanding debt.

        Provisions in APS' mortgage bond indenture and articles of incorporation
require certain  coverage ratios to be met before APS can issue additional first
mortgage bonds or preferred  stock. In addition,  the bond indenture  limits the
amount of additional first mortgage bonds which may be issued to a percentage of
net property additions,  to the amount of certain first mortgage bonds that have
been  redeemed or  retired,  and/or to cash  deposited  with the  mortgage  bond
trustee.  After giving  proforma effect to the redemption of the 10.25% Bonds as
of December 31, 1994,  APS estimates that the bond indenture and the articles of
incorporation  would  then have  allowed it to issue up to  approximately  $1.33
billion and $768 million of additional first mortgage bonds and preferred stock,
respectively.

        The Arizona  Corporation  Commission  (ACC) has authority  over APS with
respect to the issuance of long-term  debt and equity  securities.  Existing ACC
orders allow APS to have up to approximately  $2.6 billion in long-term debt and
approximately $501 million of preferred stock outstanding at any one time.

        Management  does not expect any of the foregoing  restrictions  to limit
APS' ability to meet its capital requirements.

        As of December 31, 1994, APS had credit  commitments  from various banks
totaling  approximately $300 million, which were available either to support the
issuance of  commercial  paper or to be used as bank  borrowings.  There were no
bank  borrowings  outstanding at the end of 1994.  Commercial  paper  borrowings
totaling $131.5 million were then outstanding.

Non-Utility Subsidiaries

        During the past  three  years,  the  non-utility  subsidiaries  together
funded all of their operations  through cash flow from operations and financings
that did not involve Pinnacle West.  SunCor's capital needs consist primarily of
construction expenditures, which, on the basis of projects now under development
by it, are expected to approximate $35 million,  $31 million and $11 million for
1995, 1996 and 1997,  respectively.  Capital  resources  available to meet these
requirements   include  funds  provided  by  SunCor's  operations  and  external
financings.

        During 1994, SunCor issued $30 million of collateralized mortgage bonds.
These bonds are secured by  specified  parcels of real  property.  Additionally,
SunCor established revolving lines of credit totaling $24.5 million; at December
31, 1994,  borrowings of $18.5 million were outstanding  thereunder.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

1994 Compared with 1993 

        Pinnacle  West  reported  income from  continuing  operations  of $200.6
million in 1994,  which  included a  non-recurring  income tax  benefit of $26.8
million.  Excluding  the  non-recurring  tax  benefit,  income  from  continuing
operations in 1994 was $173.8 million compared with $170.0 million in 1993.

        Underlying the small increase were several significant factors. Electric
operating  revenues  increased  primarily  due to  strong  customer  growth  and
significantly  warmer  weather in 1994,  partially  offset by lower  interchange
sales and the 1994 rate reduction.  Substantially offsetting the earnings effect
of the 1994 rate reduction was a one-time depreciation reversal, also occasioned
by the 1994 rate  settlement.  Interest expense declined due primarily to parent
company  debt  repayment  and APS'  refinancing  efforts in 1994 and 1993.  APS'
effort to refinance high-cost debt, started in 1992, was substantially completed
at the end of 1994.

        Substantially  offsetting  these positive factors were the completion in
May 1994 of the recording of non-cash income related to a 1991 rate  settlement;
increased utility  operations and maintenance  expense due primarily to employee
severance costs related to various cost-reduction efforts; and increased nuclear
decommissioning costs reflecting the most recent site-specific study.

        Fuel and purchased power expenses remained relatively  unchanged in 1994
compared  with 1993.  Higher  costs to meet  increased  retail  sales were about
offset by lower fuel costs for reduced  interchange  sales.  APS does not have a
fuel adjustment clause as part of its retail rate structure;  therefore, changes
in fuel and purchased power expenses are reflected currently in earnings.

        SunCor reported a small profit in 1994 compared with a $4.0 million loss
in 1993.  Real estate  revenues and operating  expenses in 1994 increased  $27.0
million  and  $21.6  million,  respectively,  reflecting  increased  volumes  of
residential and commercial property sales. 

1993 Compared with 1992 

        Pinnacle  West  reported  income from  continuing  operations  of $170.0
million in 1993 compared with $150.4  million in 1992.  The primary  factor that
contributed to this increase was lower interest  expense due to refinancing debt
at lower rates,  lower  average debt balances and lower  interest  rates on APS'
variable-rate  debt.  Partially  offsetting  the  lower  interest  expense  were
increased taxes and higher utility operating expenses.

        Electric  operating  revenue  increased  significantly  due to  customer
growth.  Offsetting  customer  growth  were the  effects of milder  weather  and
increased  fuel and purchased  power costs due to Palo Verde outages and reduced
power levels  related to steam  generator tube problems (see Note 11 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements).

        Utility operations and maintenance  expense for 1993 increased over 1992
levels  primarily  due to the  implementation  of new  accounting  standards for
postemployment benefits and postretirement  benefits other than pensions,  which
added  $17.0  million to  expense  in 1993 (see Note 8 of Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements). Partially offsetting these factors were lower power plant
operating costs, lower rent expense and lower costs for an employee  cost-saving
incentive plan.

        Real estate revenues and operating  expenses increased $12.3 million and
$10.9  million,  respectively,  in 1993  due  primarily  to  increased  sales of
residential lots.

Electric Operating Revenues

        Electric  operating revenues reflect changes in both the volume of units
sold and price per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh) of electric  sales.  An analysis of the
changes in 1994 and 1993  electric  operating  revenues  compared with the prior
year follows (in millions of dollars):

                                                1994       1993
                                                ----       ----
            Volume variance                    $86.7      $22.3
            1994 rate reduction                (27.4)        --
            Interchange sales                  (19.5)      (7.2)
            Reversal of refund obligation      (12.1)        --
            Other operating revenues            (3.9)      (0.3)
                                               -----      -----
                 Total change                  $23.8      $14.8
                                               =====      =====

        The volume  increase in 1994  primarily  reflects  the effects on retail
sales of customer  growth ($56 million) and warmer  weather ($42  million).  The
volume  increase in 1993 was  primarily  due to customer  growth ($41  million),
partially  offset by milder  weather  ($20  million  reduction).  Other  factors
affecting volumes include changes in usage,  unbilled revenue and firm sales for
resale for a net total of $11 million  reduction in 1994 and $1 million increase
in 1993.  

Income  Tax  Issues  

        See Note 3 of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  regarding
recognition  of  $26.8  million  of  income  tax  benefits  in 1994 and a recent
accounting  standard for income taxes which required the  recognition in 1993 of
$19.3 million of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards.

Other Income/Rate Settlement Impacts

        Net income reflects  accounting  practices required for regulated public
utilities  and  represents  a composite of cash and  non-cash  items,  including
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction  (AFUDC),  accretion income on Palo
Verde Unit 3 and the  reversal  of a refund  obligation  arising out of the 1991
rate settlement (see  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows and Note 1 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements).  The accretion and refund reversals,  net
of income taxes, totaled $25.9 million, $58.2 million and $53.6 million in 1994,
1993 and 1992,  respectively.  APS has now recorded all of the Palo Verde Unit 3
accretion income and refund obligation reversals related to the 1991 settlement.
Also in 1994 was a one-time Palo Verde depreciation reversal of $15 million, net
of  income  tax,  which  is  included  in  "Other  -- net"  in the  Consolidated
Statements of Income (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

        The retail rate settlement which was approved by the ACC in May 1994 did
not  significantly  affect 1994  earnings as  previously  discussed,  and is not
expected  to  significantly  affect  earnings  for the years 1995  through  1999
because  the  rate  reduction  will  be  substantially   offset  by  accelerated
amortization  of  deferred  investment  tax  credits  (see  Note 2 of  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements).  

Competition 

        A  significant  challenge for APS will be how well it is able to respond
to increasingly  competitive conditions in the electric utility industry,  while
continuing  to earn  an  acceptable  return  for  its  shareholders.  Strategies
emphasize  managing costs,  stabilizing  electric rates,  negotiating  long-term
contracts with large customers and capitalizing on the growth characteristics of
APS' service territory.

        One of the issues that must be addressed  responsibly is the recovery in
a more competitive  environment of the carrying value of assets (including those
referred to in Note 1K of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements) acquired
or recorded under the existing regulatory environment.

        Pursuant to the 1994 rate settlement, APS and the ACC staff will develop
certain  procedures  that are  responsive  to the  competitive  forces in larger
customer segments, with the objective of making joint recommendations to the ACC
in 1995. A separate ACC proceeding on competition  was opened in mid-1994 and is
expected to continue for some months.


        As the forces of  competition  continue to impact the industry,  it will
become  clearer  as to what  customer  sectors  and  what  regions  will be most
affected and what strategies are best to deal with those forces.



REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

    The primary  responsibility  for the integrity of Pinnacle West's  financial
information rests with management, which has prepared the accompanying financial
statements and related information.  Such information was prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles  appropriate in the circumstances,
based on management's  best estimates and judgments and giving due consideration
to  materiality.  These  financial  statements  have been audited by independent
auditors and their report is included.

    Management   maintains  and  relies  upon  systems  of  internal  accounting
controls.  A limiting  factor in all systems of internal  accounting  control is
that the cost of the  system  should  not exceed  the  benefits  to be  derived.
Management believes that Pinnacle West's system provides the appropriate balance
between such costs and benefits.

    Periodically  the internal  accounting  system is reviewed by both  Pinnacle
West's internal  auditors and its  independent  auditors to test for compliance.
Reports  issued by the internal  auditors are released to  management,  and such
reports,  or summaries  thereof,  are  transmitted to the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors and the independent auditors on a timely basis.

    The  Audit   Committee,   composed  solely  of  outside   directors,   meets
periodically  with the internal  auditors and  independent  auditors (as well as
management)  to review the work of each. The internal  auditors and  independent
auditors have free access to the Audit Committee, without management present, to
discuss the results of their audit work.

    Management  believes that Pinnacle West's  systems,  policies and procedures
provide  reasonable  assurance that  operations are conducted in conformity with
the law and with management's commitment to a high standard of business conduct.

                                                      & Chief Financial Officer

                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


    We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Pinnacle
West Capital  Corporation and its  subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993
and the related  consolidated  statements of income,  retained earnings and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December  31,  1994.  Our
audits also included the  financial  statement  schedule  listed in the Index at
Item 8. These  financial  statements  and financial  statement  schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial  statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits.

    We conducted  our audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in
all  material  respects,   the  financial  position  of  Pinnacle  West  Capital
Corporation  and its  subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993 and the results
of their  operations  and their  cash  flows for each of the three  years in the
period ended December 31, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted  accounting
principles.  Also,  in our opinion,  such  financial  statement  schedule,  when
considered  in  relation  to the basic  financial  statements  taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

    As discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes  effective  January 1,
1993 to conform with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109.

                       PINNACLE WEST CAPITAL CORPORATION
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

        A. Consolidation

        The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of Pinnacle
West Capital  Corporation and its subsidiaries:  Arizona Public Service Company,
an electric  utility;  SunCor  Development  Company,  a real estate  development
company; and El Dorado Investment Company, a venture capital firm.

        B. Utility Plant and Depreciation

        Utility plant  represents the buildings,  equipment and other facilities
used to provide  electric  service.  The cost of utility plant  includes  labor,
materials,  contract  services,  other  related items and an allowance for funds
used during  construction.  The cost of retired  depreciable utility plant, plus
removal costs less salvage realized, is charged to accumulated depreciation.

        Depreciation on utility  property is recorded on a straight-line  basis.
The  applicable  rates for 1992 through 1994 ranged from 0.84% to 15.00%,  which
resulted  in an  annual  composite  rate of 3.43%  for  1994.  Depreciation  and
amortization  of  non-utility  property  and  equipment  are  provided  over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from 3 to 33.3 years.

        C. Revenues

        Electric  operating  revenues are  recognized  on the accrual  basis and
include  estimated  amounts for service rendered but unbilled at the end of each
accounting period.

        In 1991 APS recorded a refund obligation of $53.4 million ($32.3 million
after tax) as a result of a 1991 rate settlement. The refund obligation was used
to reduce  the  amount of a 1991  rate  increase  granted  rather  than  require
specific  customer  refunds and was  reversed  over the thirty  months ended May
1994. The after-tax refund  obligation  reversals that were recorded as electric
operating  revenues by APS amounted to $5.6 million in 1994 and $12.9 million in
each of the years 1993 and 1992.

        Consistent with the 1994  presentation,  prior years electric  operating
revenues  and other taxes have been  restated  to exclude  sales tax on electric
revenue.

        D. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

        AFUDC  represents  the cost of debt and  equity  funds  used to  finance
construction of utility plant.  Plant construction  costs,  including AFUDC, are
recovered in authorized rates through  depreciation when completed  projects are
placed  into  commercial  operation.  AFUDC  does  not  represent  current  cash
earnings.

        AFUDC has been calculated using composite rates of 7.70% for 1994; 7.20%
for 1993; and 10.00% for 1992. APS compounds  AFUDC  semiannually  and ceases to
accrue AFUDC when  construction  work is completed and the property is placed in
service.  

        E. Income Taxes

        Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries  file a consolidated  U.S. income tax
return.  Provisions for income taxes are made by each  subsidiary as if separate
income tax returns were filed. The difference,  if any, between these provisions
and consolidated income tax expense is allocated to Pinnacle West.

        Investment tax credits  (ITCs) were deferred and are being  amortized to
other income over the estimated  lives of the related  assets as directed by the
ACC. The 1994 retail rate settlement  provides for  accelerated  amortization of
ITCs over five years beginning in 1995 (see Note 2).

        F. Reacquired Debt Costs

        APS  amortizes  gains and losses on  reacquired  debt over the remaining
life of the original debt, consistent with ratemaking.

        G. Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Costs

        Nuclear  fuel is charged to fuel  expense  using the  unit-of-production
method under which the number of units of thermal energy produced in the current
period is related to the total  thermal  units  expected to be produced over the
remaining life of the fuel.

        Under  federal  law,  the United  States  Department  of Energy (DOE) is
responsible  for the permanent  disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE assesses
$.001 per kWh of nuclear  generation.  This  amount is  charged to nuclear  fuel
expense and recovered through rates.

        In 1994, APS recorded  $11.9 million for  decommissioning  expense.  APS
estimates  it  will  cost  approximately  $2.1  billion  ($425  million  in 1994
dollars),  over a thirteen-year  period  beginning in 2023, to decommission  its
29.1% interest in Palo Verde.  Decommissioning costs are charged to expense over
the respective units operating  license term and are included in the accumulated
depreciation balance until each Palo Verde unit is fully decommissioned. Nuclear
decommissioning costs are currently recovered in rates.

        APS is utilizing a 1992 site-specific study for Palo Verde, prepared for
APS by an independent consultant, that assumes the prompt  removal/dismantlement
method of decommissioning. The study is updated every three years.

        As required by the ACC, APS has established external trust accounts into
which quarterly deposits are made for decommissioning.  As of December 31, 1994,
APS has deposited a total of $45.0  million.  The trust accounts are included in
Investments  and Other  Assets on the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets at a market
value of $55.2  million on  December  31,  1994.  The trust  funds are  invested
primarily in  fixed-income  securities  and domestic stock and are classified as
available for sale. Gains and losses are reflected in accumulated depreciation.

        In 1994, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) added a project
to its  agenda on  accounting  for  nuclear  decommissioning  obligations.  Only
preliminary  views  have been  discussed  at this time,  however,  there is some
indication  the FASB may  require  the  estimated  present  value of the cost of
decommissioning  to be recorded as a liability  along with an  offsetting  plant
asset.  Pinnacle  West  is  unable  to  determine  what,  if any,  impact  these
deliberations may have on its financial position or results of operations.

        H. Statements of Cash Flows

        Temporary cash  investments and marketable  securities are considered to
be cash equivalents for purposes of the  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows.
During 1994, 1993 and 1992 Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries paid interest, net
of amounts  capitalized,  of $231.6 million,  $243.9 million and $286.4 million,
respectively.  Income  taxes paid were $56.5  million,  $45.3  million and $33.8
million,  respectively;  and dividends paid on preferred stock of APS were $26.2
million, $30.9 million and $32.6 million, respectively.

        I. Palo Verde Cost Deferrals

        As authorized by the ACC, APS deferred  operating costs (excluding fuel)
and financing  costs of Palo Verde Units 2 and 3 from the  commercial  operation
date  (September 1986 and January 1988,  respectively)  until the date the units
were included in a rate order (April 1988 and December 1991, respectively).  The
deferrals are being amortized and recovered  through rates over thirty-five year
periods.

        J. Palo Verde Accretion Income

        In 1991,  APS  discounted  the  carrying  value of Palo  Verde Unit 3 to
reflect  the  present  value  of lost  cash  flows  resulting  from a 1991  rate
settlement  agreement  deeming a portion  of the unit to  temporarily  be excess
capacity.  In accordance  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  APS
recorded  accretion  income  over a  thirty-month  period  ended May 1994 in the
aggregate  amount of the  original  discount.  The  after-tax  accretion  income
recorded  by APS in 1994,  1993 and 1992 was $20.3  million,  $45.3  million and
$40.7 million, respectively.

        K. Regulatory Accounting

        APS prepares its financial  statements in accordance with the provisions
of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No. 71,  "Accounting for
the Effects of Certain Types of  Regulation".  SFAS No. 71 requires a cost-based
rate-regulated  enterprise to reflect the impact of regulatory  decisions in its
financial statements.

        APS' major regulatory  assets are Palo Verde cost deferrals (see Note 1)
and deferred taxes (see Note 3). These items,  combined with miscellaneous other
items and  regulatory  liabilities,  amounted to  approximately  $1.1 billion at
December 31, 1994 and 1993,  most of which are included in "Deferred  Debits" on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

2.   Regulatory Matters

        In May 1994, the ACC approved a retail rate  settlement  agreement which
was  jointly  proposed  by APS and the ACC staff.  The major  provisions  of the
settlement include:

         o  A net annual rate  reduction  of  approximately  $32.3  million ($19
            million after tax), or 2.2% on average effective June 1, 1994.

         o  A moratorium  on filing for  permanent  rate  changes,  except under
            certain circumstances, prior to the end of 1996 for both APS and the
            ACC staff.

         o  A joint  APS-ACC  study to  develop  rate  principles  allowing  APS
            greater  flexibility  to deal with market  conditions and increasing
            competition in the electric industry.

         o  All of Palo Verde Unit 3 included in rate base.

         o  An  incentive   rewarding   reduction  in  fuel  and  operating  and
            maintenance cost per kWh below established targets.

         As part of the settlement,  APS reversed  approximately  $20 million of
depreciation ($15 million after tax) related to a 1991 Palo Verde write-off. The
1994 settlement also provided for the accelerated  amortization of substantially
all  deferred  ITCs over a five-year  period  beginning  in 1995.  Overall,  the
settlement  is not expected to materially  affect APS results of operations  for
the years 1995-1999.

3.   Income Tax Expense

Non-recurring Income Tax Benefit

         The recognition of $26.8 million of  non-recurring  income tax benefits
in 1994 relates to a change in tax law.

Change in Accounting for Income Taxes

         Effective  January  1,  1993,  Pinnacle  West  adopted  SFAS  No.  109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the use of the liability method of
accounting for income taxes. The cumulative effect on prior years of this change
in  accounting  principle  resulted  in an  increase in 1993 net income of $19.3
million,  due primarily to the recognition of deferred tax benefits  relating to
state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of Pinnacle West.

         As a result of adopting SFAS No. 109, APS recorded  additional deferred
income taxes  related to the equity  component of AFUDC;  the debt  component of
AFUDC recorded  net-of-tax;  and other temporary  differences for which deferred
income taxes had not been provided. Deferred tax balances were also adjusted for
changes in tax rates. The adoption of SFAS No. 109 increased net deferred income
tax  liabilities  by $585.3  million at December  31,  1993.  Historically,  the
Federal  Energy  Regulatory   Commission  and  the  ACC  have  allowed  revenues
sufficient to pay for these  deferred tax  liabilities  and, in accordance  with
SFAS No. 109, a regulatory asset was established in a corresponding amount.







        At December 31, 1994,  Pinnacle  West had federal NOL  carryforwards  of
approximately  $80  million  which  may be  used  through  2005  and  state  NOL
carryforwards of approximately $490 million which expire in 1995.  Pinnacle West
also had ITC  carryforwards  of  approximately  $18 million which expire in 2000
through 2005. 

4. Lines of Credit 

         APS had committed lines of credit with various banks of $300 million at
December 31, 1994,  and $302 million at December 31, 1993,  which were available
either  to  support  the  issuance  of  commercial  paper or to be used for bank
borrowings. The commitment fees on these lines were 0.25% per annum through June
30,  1994,  0.20% per annum on $200  million and 0.15% per annum on $100 million
thereafter,  through  December 31, 1994.  APS had  commercial  paper  borrowings
outstanding  of $131.5  million at  December  31,  1994,  and $148.0  million at
December 31, 1993.  The  weighted  average  interest  rate on  commercial  paper
borrowings  was 6.25% on December 31, 1994,  and 3.48% on December 31, 1993.  By
Arizona  statute,  APS  short-term  borrowings  cannot  exceed  7% of its  total
capitalization without the consent of the ACC.

        SunCor had revolving  lines of credit totaling $24.5 million at December
31, 1994, and none at December 31, 1993. Any  borrowings are  collateralized  by
certain  real  property  and would bear  interest  based on the prime rate or on
London Interbank  Offered Rate (LIBOR).  The commitment fees on these lines were
0.5% per annum on $15.0 million and 0.2% per annum on $9.5  million.  SunCor had
$18.5 million  outstanding  under these lines at December 31, 1994. 

5. Long-Term Debt


        Aggregate annual principal  payments due on total long-term debt and for
sinking fund  requirements  through 1999 are as follows:  1995,  $78.5  million;
1996,  $50.7 million;  1997,  $166.9 million;  1998,  $113.4 million;  and 1999,
$112.8  million.  See Note 6 for  redemption  and sinking fund  requirements  of
redeemable preferred stock of APS.

         On January 12, 1995, APS issued $75 million of 10% junior  subordinated
deferrable interest debentures (MIDS) due 2025.




         If there were to be any  arrearage in dividends on any of its preferred
stock or in the sinking fund  requirements  applicable to any of its  redeemable
preferred  stock, APS could not pay dividends on its common stock or acquire any
shares  thereof for  consideration.  The redemption  requirements  for the above
issues for the next five years are:  $0 in 1995 and 1996,  and $10.0  million in
each of the years 1997 through 1999.

        Redeemable  preferred stock transactions of APS during each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1994, are as follows:

(a)  Including premiums and expenses of preferred stock issues of APS.

        The Pinnacle West Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan (renamed
the Investors Advantage Plan in 1995) provides that any participant may purchase
shares of its common stock directly from Pinnacle West.

        Both  Pinnacle  West and APS have  employee  savings  plans  under which
contributions  by participating  employees and  contributions by employers could
involve the issuance of new shares of Pinnacle West common stock.  Contributions
made by Pinnacle West and APS to their respective  employee retirement plans may
also involve one or more such issuances of common stock. However,  Pinnacle West
plans to continue making market  purchases of its outstanding  stock to meet its
needs related to the Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan, the employee
savings plans and the employee retirement plans.

        Pinnacle West has incentive plans under which it may grant non-qualified
stock options  (NQSOs),  incentive  stock options  (ISOs) and  restricted  stock
awards to officers and key employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries up to
an aggregate of 6.5 million shares of Pinnacle West common stock. The plans also
provide for the  granting of any  combination  of stock  appreciation  rights or
dividend equivalents.  As of December 31, 1994,  approximately  1,917,500 NQSOs,
9,000 ISOs, 287,000 restricted shares and 35,000 dividend equivalent shares were
outstanding.  A plan for  Pinnacle  West's directors  under which an  additional
150,500 NQSOs were  outstanding  at December 31, 1994, was replaced in 1994 by a
plan that  provides  for the  granting  of stock to  directors  as part of their
annual  retainers up to an aggregate  amount of 50,000 shares.  

8. Pension Plans and Other  Benefits  

Pension Plans  

         Pinnacle West and its  subsidiaries  sponsor  defined  benefit  pension
plans  covering  substantially  all  employees.  Benefits  are based on years of
service and  compensation  utilizing a final  average pay benefit  formula.  The
plans are funded on a current basis to the extent  deductible under existing tax
regulations.  Plan assets consist primarily of domestic and international common
stocks and bonds and real estate.  Pension cost, including  administrative cost,
for 1994, 1993 and 1992 was approximately $25.8 million, $14.3 million and $14.4
million,  respectively,  of which approximately $12.3 million,  $6.8 million and
$4.3  million,  respectively,  was charged to expense.  The remainder was either
capitalized or billed to others.





        In  addition to the  defined  benefit  pension  plans  described  above,
Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries also sponsor  qualified defined  contribution
plans.  Collectively,  these plans cover substantially all employees.  The plans
provide for employee  contributions and partial employer matching  contributions
after  certain  eligibility  requirements  are met.  The cost of these plans for
1994,  1993  and  1992  was  $7.0  million,   $6.4  million  and  $5.4  million,
respectively,   of  which  $3.3   million,   $3.1  million  and  $2.6   million,
respectively, was charged to expense. 

Postretirement Plans 

         Pinnacle West and its  subsidiaries  provide medical and life insurance
benefits to their retired  employees.  Employees  may become  eligible for these
retirement  benefits  based on years of service  and age.  The  retiree  medical
insurance  plans  are  contributory;   the  retiree  life  insurance  plans  are
noncontributory.  In accordance with the governing plan documents, the companies
retain the right to change or eliminate these benefits.

    During 1993, Pinnacle West adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers'  Accounting for
Postretirement  Benefits  Other  Than  Pensions,"  which  requires  the  cost of
postretirement  benefits be accrued during the years  employees  render service.
Prior to 1993,  the costs of retiree  benefits  were  recognized as expense when
claims were paid. This change had the effect of increasing 1994 and 1993 retiree
benefits costs from approximately $6 million in each year to $28 million and $35
million,  respectively.  The amount  charged to expense for 1994  increased from
about $3 million to $14 million, and for 1993 increased from about $2 million to
$17 million.  The balance was either  capitalized or billed to others. The above
amounts include the amortization  (over 20 years) of the initial  postretirement
benefit obligation estimated at January 1, 1993, to be $184 million.  Funding is
based upon actuarially determined  contributions that take tax consequences into
account. Plan assets consist primarily of domestic stocks and bonds.





         Assuming a one percent increase in the health care cost trend rate, the
1994 cost of  postretirement  benefits  other than  pensions  would  increase by
approximately $5 million and the accumulated  benefit  obligation as of December
31, 1994, would increase by approximately $31 million.

         In 1993, Pinnacle West adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment  Benefits".  The standard required a change from a cash method to
an accrual  method in  accounting  for benefits  (such as long-term  disability)
provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement.
The  adoption of this  standard  resulted in an increase in 1993  postemployment
benefit expense of approximately $2 million.

9.   Leases

         In 1986, APS entered into sale and leaseback  transactions  under which
it sold  approximately  42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain common
facilities.  The gain of  approximately  $140.2 million has been deferred and is
being  amortized to operations  expense over the original lease term. The leases
are  being  accounted  for as  operating  leases.  The  amounts  paid  each year
approximate  $40.1 million through December 1999, $46.3 million through December
2000,  and  $49.0  million  through  December  2015.  Options  to renew  for two
additional years and to purchase the property at fair market value at the end of
the lease terms are also included.  Consistent with the ratemaking treatment, an
amount  equal to the annual  lease  payments  is  included  in rent  expense.  A
regulatory asset (totaling approximately $52.8 million at December 31, 1994) has
been  established  for the  difference  between lease  payments and rent expense
calculated on a straight-line  basis.  Lease expense for 1994, 1993 and 1992 was
$42.2 million, $41.8 million and $45.8 million, respectively.

        APS has a capital  lease on a  combined  cycle  plant  which it sold and
leased back. The lease requires semiannual payments of $2.6 million through June
2001, and includes renewal and purchase options based on fair market value. This
plant is included  in plant in service at its  original  cost of $54.4  million;
accumulated amortization at December 31, 1994, was $40.3 million.

        In addition,  Pinnacle  West and its  subsidiaries  lease  certain land,
buildings,  equipment and  miscellaneous  other items through  operating  rental
agreements with varying terms, provisions and expiration dates. Rent expense for
1994,  1993 and 1992 was  approximately  $21.3 million,  $21.5 million and $26.1
million, respectively.  Annual future minimum rental commitments,  excluding the
Palo Verde and combined cycle leases,  through 1999 are as follows:  1995, $17.6
million;  1996,  $14.6 million;  1997, $14.5 million;  1998, $14.6 million;  and
1999, $14.7 million.  Total rental  commitments after 1999 are estimated at $189
million. 



11.   Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

         Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries are parties to various claims, legal
actions  and  complaints  arising in the  ordinary  course of  business.  In the
opinion of management,  the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a
material  adverse  effect on the  operations  or financial  position of Pinnacle
West.

Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station

         APS has  encountered  tube cracking in steam  generators and has taken,
and will continue to take, remedial actions that it believes have slowed further
tube  problems to  manageable  levels.  APS  believes  that the Palo Verde steam
generators  are  capable  of  operating  for  their  designed  life of 40 years,
although  at some  point,  long-term  economic  considerations  may  make  steam
generator replacement  desirable.  All of the Palo Verde units were operating at
full power at December 31, 1994.

         The  Palo  Verde  participants  have  insurance  for  public  liability
payments  resulting  from nuclear  energy hazards to the full limit of liability
under  federal law.  This  potential  liability is covered by primary  liability
insurance  provided  by  commercial  insurance  carriers  in the  amount of $200
million and the balance by an industry-wide  retrospective  assessment  program.
The maximum  assessment per reactor under the  retrospective  rating program for
each nuclear incident is approximately  $79 million,  subject to an annual limit
of $10 million per  incident.  Based upon APS' 29.1%  interest in the three Palo
Verde units, APS maximum  potential  assessment per incident for all three units
is approximately $69 million, with an annual payment limitation of approximately
$9 million.

         The Palo Verde  participants  maintain  "all risk"  (including  nuclear
hazards) insurance for property damage to, and  decontamination  of, property at
Palo Verde in the aggregate  amount of $2.78 billion,  a substantial  portion of
which must first be applied to stabilization and  decontamination.  APS has also
secured  insurance  against  portions of any  increased  cost of  generation  or
purchased power and business interruption resulting from a sudden and unforeseen
outage of any of the three units. The insurance  coverage  discussed in this and
the previous paragraph is subject to certain policy conditions and exclusions.

El Paso Electric Company  Bankruptcy 

         El Paso Electric  Company  (EPEC),  one of the joint owners of the Palo
Verde and Four Corners  facilities,  has been operating  under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy  Code since 1992. A plan  whereby  EPEC would  become a  wholly-owned
subsidiary of Central and South West Corporation (CSW) has been confirmed by the
bankruptcy  court,  but  cannot  become  fully  effective  until  several  other
approvals  are  obtained.   Under  the  plan,  certain  issues,  including  EPEC
allegations  regarding the 1989-90 Palo Verde  outages,  would be resolved,  and
EPEC would assume the joint facilities operating agreements. CSW has stated that
several  matters have arisen which may impede  completion of the merger.  If the
plan is not  approved,  Pinnacle  West does not  expect  that  there  would be a
material adverse effect on its operations or financial position.

Construction Program

         Total construction  expenditures in 1995 are estimated at $335 million,
excluding capitalized property taxes and capitalized interest.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

         APS is a party to various fuel and purchased power contracts with terms
expiring from 1995 through 2020. APS estimates its 1995 contract requirements to
be  approximately  $127  million.  However,  this amount may vary  significantly
pursuant to certain  provisions in such  contracts  which permit APS to decrease
its required purchases under certain circumstances.



13. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

         Pinnacle West estimates that carrying  amounts of its cash  equivalents
and commercial  paper are reasonable  estimates of their fair values at December
31, 1994 and 1993 due to their short maturities.

        The  December  31,  1994  and  1993  fair  values  of  debt  and  equity
investments,  determined by using quoted market  values or by  discounting  cash
flows at rates  equal to  Pinnacle  West's  cost of  capital,  approximate their
carrying  amounts.  It was not  practical to estimate the fair values of several
investments in joint ventures and untraded equity securities because costs to do
so would be excessive.  The carrying  value of these  investments  totaled $40.6
million and $45.6 million at year-end 1994 and 1993,  respectively.  Investments
in debt and equity securities are held for purposes other than trading.

        On December 31, 1994, the carrying  amount of long-term debt  (excluding
$26 million of capital  lease  obligations)  was $2.64 billion and its estimated
fair value was approximately  $2.49 billion.  On December 31, 1993, the carrying
amount of long-term debt  (excluding  $30 million of capital lease  obligations)
was $2.68 billion and its estimated fair value was approximately  $2.91 billion.
The fair value  estimates were  determined by  independent  sources using quoted
market rates where available.  Where market prices were not available,  the fair
values were based on market values of comparable instruments.
